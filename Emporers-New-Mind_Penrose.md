# Penrose Roger - The Emperor's New Mind_ Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics

**Introduction to AI and Consciousness**
- The text discusses the question of whether computers can have minds or consciousness
- It explores the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications
- The Turing test is introduced as a way to evaluate machine intelligence

**The Turing Test**
- Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950
- Involves an interrogator trying to distinguish between a human and a computer through text-based conversation
- If the interrogator cannot consistently identify the computer, it passes the test
- The test is meant to evaluate whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior

**Strong AI**
- A philosophical position that claims a sufficiently advanced computer program can have genuine consciousness and understanding
- Argues that mental states are essentially computational processes that can be replicated in any suitable hardware
- Contrasts with weak AI, which only claims computers can simulate intelligent behavior

**Searle's Chinese Room Argument**
- Thought experiment proposed by philosopher John Searle to challenge strong AI
- Imagines a person who doesn't understand Chinese following instructions to respond to Chinese messages
- Argues that syntax (following rules) is not sufficient for semantics (understanding)
- Aims to show that running a program is not equivalent to understanding

**Hardware vs. Software**
- Hardware refers to physical components of a computer
- Software refers to programs and algorithms run on the hardware
- Strong AI view emphasizes software/algorithms as the essence of mind, downplaying hardware

**Philosophical Issues**
- Questions the nature of consciousness, understanding, and personal identity
- Explores whether consciousness can be reduced to information processing
- Considers thought experiments like teleportation and copying minds

**Criticisms of Strong AI**
- Searle and others argue genuine understanding requires more than just information processing
- Questions whether simulating intelligence is the same as having intelligence
- Raises issues about the importance of biological brains vs. artificial hardware

**Unresolved Questions**
- The text leaves open many philosophical and empirical questions about machine consciousness
- Suggests the need for further developments in neuroscience and physics to address these issues
- Implies that current AI may be far from genuine machine consciousness or understanding

**President Pollo's Speech**:
- Marked the initiation of the new Ultronic computer
- President was not fond of such occasions, but knew it would save him time
- He had spent a great deal of treasury gold on the computer, hoping it would take over "awkward decisions"

**Adam's Perspective**:
- Sat in the third row
- His mother, a chief technocrat, was two rows in front of him
- His father was uninvited and surrounded by security guards because he had tried to bomb the computer
- Adam had little feeling for either parent and had been raised almost entirely by computers since birth

**The Chief Designer's Speech**:
- The Ultronic computer has over 10^17 logical units, more than the number of neurons in everyone in the country
- It will be "unimaginable" in its intelligence, but they did not need to imagine it
- The First Lady, Madame Isabella Pollo, threw the switch to turn on the computer
- The Chief Designer asked if anyone had a question for the new Ultronic system

**Adam's Question**:
- Adam raised his hand and was the rst to ask a question
- He was curious about what it might be like to "be a computer" since he had grown up with computers

### 1 Can A Computer Have A Mind?

**Computers and Minds: Understanding the Relation Between Physical Laws, Mathematics, Conscious Thinking, and the Nature of Minds**

**Introduction:**
- Discusses the impact of computer technology on human thinking capabilities
- Questions whether a mechanical device can have a mind or experience feelings
- Examines deep philosophical issues: meaning of thinking/feeling, nature of minds, existence of minds, and their relationship with physical structures.

**Modern Computer Technology:**
- Rapid advancements in computer technology
- Machines perform tasks previously exclusive to human thinking
- Questions raised about the implications for human superiority if machines can outperform us mentally

**Historical Context:**
- Question of whether a mechanical device can think or have a mind is not new
- Receives renewed urgency with modern computer technology development
- Issues touched upon include: nature of mathematics, conscious thinking, and the relationship between physical structures and minds.

**Philosophical Questions:**
1. What does it mean to think or feel?
2. What is a mind?
3. Do minds exist?
4. Are minds functionally dependent on physical structures?
5. Can minds exist independently of such structures?
6. Must relevant structures be biological (brains) or electronic?
7. Are minds subject to the laws of physics?
8. What are the fundamental laws of physics?
9. What is the relationship between thought and consciousness, mathematics, and physical laws?
10. Can we come to grips with the concept of mind in physical or logical terms?

**Unconventional Viewpoint:**
- The author's point of view is unconventional among physicists
- Argues that our current lack of understanding of fundamental physics prevents us from fully comprehending the nature of minds.

**Challenges in Physics:**
1. Understanding the laws governing subatomic particles and their interactions
2. Reconciling quantum theory with special relativity
3. Constructing a consistent quantum gravity theory
4. Understanding physics at extremely small scales (less than 1/100000000000000000000 of the size of known fundamental particles)
5. Understanding black hole physics and the nature of space at their core
6. Determining whether the universe is finite or infinite in extent.

**Author's Purpose:**
- To raise new issues concerning the relation between physical laws, mathematics, conscious thinking, and mind operation
- To present a viewpoint that has not been widely expressed before
- To attempt to stimulate future research and make specific suggestions about the potential role of mind within physics development.

#### Turing Test Operationalizing Consciousness and Intelligence

**The Turing Test and Artificial Intelligence**

**Background:**
- Imagining a new, intelligent computer with human attributes
- Manufacturers claim it thinks, feels, understands, etc.
- Operational view: machine passes if acts indistinguishably from human being
- Originated in Alan Turing's article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950)

**The Test:**
- Computer and human hidden, interrogator asks questions
- Answers are impersonal, no other info about subjects
- Human answers truthfully while trying to persuade as human
- Computer lies convincingly to appear human
- Passes if interrogator cannot identify real human consistently

**Problems:**
- Unfair test for computer?
  * If roles reversed, human could outperform with complex calculations.
* However, making a computer appear stupider might not be a serious problem for its programmers.

#### Artificial Intelligence and the Turing Test Ethical Implications

**Challenges in Assessing Computer Understanding:**
- **Simples Questions**: Computers struggle with questions requiring real understanding or original thought.
- **Examples of Questions**: Rhinoceros questions, nonsensical queries can reveal a computer's limitations.
- **Turing Test**: Debate over whether passing this test indicates consciousness or just imitation.
  * Manufacturers' claims: Moral responsibilities and implications if true.
  * Personal judgments based on conversation vs. objective test results.
  * Perceptive interrogator's role in deciding computer's consciousness.
  * Original Turing test's advantages for objectivity despite biases against computers.
- **Future Expectations**: Supporters believe computers will pass the test by 2010 or sooner.

#### Artificial Intelligence Imitating Human Mental Capacities

**Turing Test and Mental Qualities in Computers**

**Importance of Imitation vs. Real Thing**
- Imitation (e.g., Turing test) may not be equivalent to the real thing
- Personal position: imitation is a rough guide, but ultimately requires further evidence

**Criteria for Judging Consciousness in Computers**
- Successful theory of consciousness required for making judgments
- Hypothetical consciousness detector could provide contrary evidence
- Approach based on evidence and faith in science/optimism

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

**Interest in AI:**
1. Robotics: industrial applications, mechanical devices performing intelligent tasks
2. Expert systems: replacing human expertise with factual information and comprehensive cross-referencing
3. Psychological insights: studying brain function through electronic devices or failures to imitate intelligence
4. Philosophical questions: potential contributions to understanding the concept of mind

**Progress in AI:**
- Early achievements: W. Grey Walters tortoise, Terry Winograd's program
- Difficulty in designing control systems for simple tasks (e.g., robot arm)
- Impressive early successes but genuine intelligence still elusive

#### AI Simulation of Pleasure and Pain in Machines Tortoise Example

**AI and Human-Like Behavior: Chess and Pleasure/Pain**

**Computer Programs Simulating Intelligence:**
- Colby's psychotherapist program: successful in deceiving patients, but has no understanding (mid-1960s)
- Chess computers: achieving respectable levels of performance (2110 Elo rating for Fidelity Excel, 2500 Elo rating for Deep Thought)
- Computers excel at solving chess problems and outstrip humans in calculation
- Human judgment plays a crucial role in achieving greater depth during analysis

**AI Approach to Pleasure and Pain:**
- Grey Walters tortoise: behavior change based on battery charge level (analogous to human hunger)
- AI's potential understanding of mental qualities like happiness, pain, or hunger
- Simplified example with a device registering its pp-score and maximizing it through various factors influencing the score.

**Computer Programs and Pleasure/Pain:**
- Device has means to register its own pp-score (pleasure-pain)
- Behavior geared towards maximizing the pp-score
- Factors influencing pp-score: battery charge, solar panels, moving towards light.

#### AIs Approach to Mimicking Human Emotions and Desires

**Artificial Intelligence and Pleasure-Pain Scale (pp-score)**

**Designing an AI Device:**
- Introduce probability weightings based on data reliability
- Provide goals beyond maintaining energy supply: companionship, learning for own sake, performing services
- Identifying pleasure and pain with pp-score as a reasonable approximation of human behavior

**Operationalist Perspective:**
- Claim that device feels pleasure when its score is positive and pain when it's negative based on its actions
- Justification comes from the fact that humans react similarly to pain and pleasure, but actions are influenced by more complex criteria

**Understanding Human Behavior:**
- Influences driving behavior: conscious (pain, pleasure) and unconscious (involuntary actions)
- Analogies between AI device's pp-score and human behavior helpful for understanding its behavior
- More to the understanding of mental qualities than can be directly obtained from AI

**AI Philosophy:**
- Simulation of actual intelligence: a serious case that must be respected and reckoned with
- Improvements in technology, design, and programming techniques will lead to better results
- Potential for creating truly intelligent devices or new principles needed

#### Chinese Room Argument and Strong AI Controversy

**Strong AI and Searle's Chinese Room Argument**

**Strong AI**:
- Extreme position on artificial intelligence (AI)
- Mental activity is simply the carrying out of a well-defined sequence of operations, an algorithm
- All mental qualities (thinking, feeling, intelligence, understanding, consciousness) are aspects of this complicated functioning

**Arguments against Strong AI**:
- **Chinese Room Argument**:
  - A computer program can pass Turing tests by mimicking human responses to stories
  - However, it does not demonstrate genuine understanding or consciousness on the part of the computer or algorithm
  - Searle's example: a computer program designed by Roger Schank can correctly answer questions about simple stories in Chinese without actually understanding them. The program is just manipulating symbols according to its instructions (algorithm) given in English.
- **Critique**:
  - A successful algorithm does not necessarily imply genuine understanding or consciousness.

#### Searles Chinese Room Argument and Objections against Strong AI

**Imagined Searle in Chinese Room**
- Couldn't understand single word of stories in Chinese

**Objections to Searle's Argument:**
1. **Pattern Perception**: Understanding involves patterns as much as individual words. One might perceive story patterns without understanding individual symbols.
2. **Algorithm Length and Complexity**: Executing a simple computer program is lengthy and tedious for humans, but not a serious objection to the principle argument.
3. **Critical Amount of Complication**: There might be a critical level of algorithm complexity required to exhibit mental qualities, which no human could carry out.
4. **Team of Symbol Manipulators**: Replacing single person with a team or even entire India does not alter the fact that individuals do not understand Chinese stories.
5. **Country vs. Brain vs. Thermostat**: Country, like thermostat, doesn't understand stories; strong AI argues only algorithm matters, not physical embodiment.
6. **Algorithm versus Understanding**: Strong AI asserts understanding comes from algorithms alone, which Searle argues is a form of dualism and lacks evidence.

**Searle's Reply:**
- Individual neurons don't understand thoughts, same for symbol manipulators in Chinese room.
- India as a whole can't understand stories no one does.
- Countries, thermostats, etc., are not in the business of understanding; only individuals can.

**Strong AI's Position**:
- Algorithm logic structure is significant for mental state representation regardless of physical embodiment.

**Arguments Against Strong AI:**
- No evidence provided that algorithms alone can embody genuine understanding or consciousness.
- Dualism raises questions about how mind and matter interact if they are separate substances.

#### The Philosophical Dilemma of Strong AI

**The Strong AI Debate: Mind vs Algorithm**

**Background:**
- Mind is not composed of matter and can exist independently
- Strong AI believes mind is a logical structure of an algorithm
- Algorithms have a disembodied existence, apart from physical realization

**Irony in Strong AI's Position:**
- Supporters of strong AI take the reality of algorithms seriously
- This leads to extreme dualism, contradicting their desired perspective

**Hofstadter's Dialogue with Einstein's Brain:**
- Book containing a complete description of Einstein's brain can answer questions like him
- Questions answered through detailed instructions in book
- Not a mere misnomer but equivalent to Einstein in operational sense

**Issues Arising from Strong AI:**
1. Activating an algorithm vs embodying it in physical form
2. Changing algorithms and mental events association
3. Awareness of the book-Einstein when unopened or disturbed
4. Multiple instances of the same state of awareness
5. Role of changes in algorithms in mental events
6. Self-awareness of the book-Einstein if never examined or disturbed

**Response from Searle:**
- Brains are digital computers, but they can have intentionality and semantics
- Distinction between biological objects (brains) and electronic ones lies in material construction
- Reasons for this distinction not well explained by Searle
- Suspicion that this assertion is dogmatic and lacks scientific theory of mind.

#### Computers Identity and Quantum Physics Material Replacement and Unique Arrangement

**Background**
- Widespread belief that everything is a digital computer (physicists led astray)
- Two concepts: hardware and software
  - Hardware: machinery involved in a computer, including specification for connections
  - Software: programs run on the machine
- Alan Turing's discovery of universal Turing machines
  * Any two such machines are equivalent through specific pieces of software
  * Modern computers are universal Turing machines
  * Differences between them are only in software (speed, storage)

**Importance of Software vs Hardware**
- Strong-AI philosophy: hardware is unimportant, software is vital
- Underlying factors from physics

**Identity and Material Composition**
- Identity not dependent on specific atoms or particles
  * Continual turnover in living body's material
  * Quantum mechanics: all particles must be identical

**Pattern of Arrangement vs Individuality of Constituents**
- Person's identity depends on pattern of how constituents are arranged, not individuality itself
- Analogy with everyday technology and electronic word processor.

#### Quantum Identity and Strong AI A Discussion on Individuality and Consciousness

**Concepts Related to Individuality and Quantum Mechanics:**
* Classical vs. quantum physics: atoms as individuals in classical physics, but not in quantum mechanics (distinction between same and indistinguishable)
* Persons individuality: configuration of material constituents, not limited to individual objects or atoms
* Strong AI argument for preserving individuality: information content can be translated into another form and recovered without loss
* Analogy with sequences of letters on screen or magnetic storage media
* Claims of strong AI supporters: consciousness as software running on hardware (brain and body)
* Discussion of teleportation machine in science fiction, debated as transportation or creation of a duplicate.

**Classical vs. Quantum Physics:**
- In classical physics: atoms can be treated as individual objects when reasonably well separated
- Atoms maintain individual identities by being continuously tracked and tabulated
- From quantum mechanics perspective, the distinction is not trivial but convenience of speech at this level

**Individuality and Configuration:**
- Individuality not tied to any specific configuration of material constituents
- In quantum mechanics, replacing one particle by an identical one does not change the situation

**Strong AI and Information Preservation:**
- If information content can be translated into another form and recovered, then a person's individuality remains intact
- Analogy with sequences of letters on display screen or magnetic storage media

**Consciousness as Software:**
- Supporters of strong AI claim that consciousness is to be taken as software running on hardware (brain and body)
- Human manifestation seen as the operation of this software by the hardware.

**Teleportation Machine Debate:**
- Teleportation machine in science fiction: intended for transportation from one planet to another
- Questions raised about its distinction from creating a duplicate and destroying the original copy
- Discussion on reliability, preparation, and ethical considerations if shown to be completely reliable.

#### Exploring Quantum Consciousness in Teleportation

**Teleportation and Strong AI**

**Identity of Atoms:**
- Preservation of identity not meaningful for atoms
- Moving pattern of atoms constitutes a wave of information

**Paradoxical Situation:**
- Traveller's awareness in two places at once after teleportation?
- Laws of physics do not make teleportation impossible in principle
- Question is whether preserving two viable copies is impossible

**Role of Quantum Mechanics:**
- Something gained about the physical nature of consciousness and individuality
- More to be discussed after examining quantum theory in Chapter 6

**Strong AI and Teleportation:**
- Strong AI supporters believe awareness would be present in magnetic or electronic device
- All relevant physics can be modeled by digital calculations according to strong AI
- Question rests on equivalence of universal Turing machines and the ability of brain to act according to algorithmic action.

6. Turing test and the equivalence of universal Turing machines and algorithms
7. Strong AI terminology vs functionalism, some proponents include Minsky (1968), Fodor (1983), Hofstadter (1979), Moravec (1989)
8. Searle's original paper criticized by Hofstadter for internalizing another human being's mind in its entirety
9. Human beings cannot internalize the entire description of another human being's mind, but the point is to execute that part of an algorithm which embodies a mental event
10. Searle's criticism of strong AI and the distinction between human and machine intelligence
11. Rotating one electron completely through 360 degrees when making interchange eliminates this signi cant difference for strong AI proponents.

### 2 Algorithms And Turing Machines

**Algorithm Concept Background**
- Algorithm: procedure or set of instructions for solving a problem, often with a finite number of steps
- Origins: derived from Al-Khowrizmi's mathematical textbook "Kitab al-jabr wal-muqabala" (c. 825 AD)
- Named after Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khowarzmi, Persian mathematician
- Ancient examples: Euclid's algorithm for finding the highest common factor of two numbers

**Euclid's Algorithm**
- Procedure for finding the highest common factor (HCF) of two numbers A and B
- Divide one number by another, find remainder R
- Replace original numbers with new pair (R, A) and repeat until a clear answer is obtained
- Last number divided is HCF
- Clear cut at each step what operation to perform and decision on termination
- Description can be presented in finite terms despite unlimited size of natural numbers
- Can be represented by a flowchart

**Remainder Operation Algorithm**
- Obtaining remainder when A is divided by B
- Keep removing successions of marks representing B from A until no more operations can be performed
- Last remaining succession provides answer
- Example: finding the remainder of 17 divided by 5 (two)

**Subroutines in Algorithm Programming**
- Subroutine: a previously known algorithm called upon and used as part of another algorithm's operation
- Euclid's algorithm includes a subroutine for finding a remainder.

**Notes**:
- The text discusses the concept of algorithms, with a focus on Euclid's algorithm for finding the highest common factor of two numbers
- Algorithms are procedures or sets of instructions for solving problems
- Origins in ancient Greek mathematics (Euclid's algorithm) and named after Al-Khowrizmi, a Persian mathematician
- Euclid's algorithm is an example of a clear cut procedure with finite steps that can be presented in finite terms
- The text also discusses the concept of subroutines, which are algorithms called upon as part of another algorithm's operation.

#### Turing Machines Idealized Calculation Devices

**The Concept of a Mechanical Procedure**

**Ancient Algorithms vs. Modern Formulation**:
- Euclid's algorithm is just one among many classical algorithms
- The precise formulation of the concept of a general algorithm dates from the 1930s
- The most direct and persuasive description was in terms of Turing machines

**Turing Machines**:
- Introduced by Alan Turing in 1935-6 as part of the solution to Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem
- A piece of abstract mathematics, not a physical object
- Designed to tackle the question of whether there exists a general mechanical procedure for solving all mathematical problems

**Hilbert's Program**:
- Sought to place mathematics on a firm foundation with axioms and rules
- Crushed by Gdel's incompleteness theorem, considered in Chapter 4

**Turing's Approach**:
- Tried to formalize the concept of a machine by breaking down its operations into elementary terms
- Regarded human thinking as an example of a machine, but this is not necessary

**The Turing Machine Concept**:
- A device with a finite number of internal states that can deal with inputs of unlimited size
- Can call upon unlimited external storage space and produce outputs of unlimited size
- Must examine only the relevant parts of the data or previous calculations, noting down the results and proceeding to the next stage

#### Turing Machine Design and Operation for Computation

**Turing Machines and Computation**
- **Idealization of Turing's Machine**: approximated by modern electronic computers
- Tape: in nite, linear sequence of squares; can be moved back and forth
- Each square is either blank or contains a single mark (0 or 1)
- Tape represents external environment, used for input/output
- Device reads tape one square at a time and moves accordingly

**Behavior of the Machine**
- Determined by internal state and input
- Operations include changing internal state, modifying tape symbols, moving along the tape
- Terminates when calculation is complete

**Definition of Machine's Operation**
- Specified through an explicit list of replacements (rules)
- Large figure on left is symbol being read; replacement is on the right
- R: move one square to the right, L: move one square left
- STOP: terminate calculation when complete

**Numbering Internal States**
- Labelled using binary numbers based on powers of 2 (0, 1, 2^1, 2^2, ...)
- Alternative notation: succession of 0s and Is.

#### Binary Coding and Turing Machine Operations

**Turing Machines and Numbering Systems:**

**Binary Notation**:
- Using binary notation for internal states, Turing machine specification abbreviated: R.STOP  STOP
- Machine in state 11010010 during calculation with tape as p.49
- Read digit on tape (0) is replaced by a 1 and internal state changes to 11
- Device moves one step left, reads next digit (1), changes internal state to 100101, and moves back right
- Further instructions replace digits read and move device along tape until STOP

**Primitive Numbering Systems**:
- Unary system: represent numbers by a string of 1s, with natural number 0 represented as blank space
- Important to separate numbers from one another for algorithms that operate on sets

**Example Turing Machines**:
- UN + 1 adds one to a unary number: simple exercise using the provided text
- EUC eects Euclid's algorithm: more complex exercise, check if it correctly determines highest common factor of two unary numbers

**Binary Coding of Numerical Data**:
- Unary system is inefficient for large numbers
- Binary number system used instead with a terminator to denote end of number representation.

#### Expanded Binary Notation for Sequences of Natural Numbers

**Expanded Binary Notation for Representing Numbers**

**Problems with Original Approach**:
- Difficulty distinguishing spaces between numbers from 0s or strings of 0s in binary representation
- Cannot code complicated instructions and numbers together

**Contraction Procedure**:
- Replace string of 0s and 1s (with finite number of Is) by a string of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, etc.
- Each digit in second sequence is the number of Is between successive 0s in first sequence

**Example**:
- Sequence "5, 13, 0, 1, 1, 4," becomes "9, 3, 4 (instruction 3), 3 (instruction 4), 0"
- In binary notation: 1011, 11011, 0, 1, 1, 100
- Coded on tape as ". . . 00001001011010100101101101011010110100011000 . . ."

**Benefits of Expanded Binary Notation**:
- Terminates description of number and distinguishes it from blank tape on right
- Enables coding any finite sequence of natural numbers in binary notation as a single string of 0s and 1s, separated by commas

**Redundancy in Binary Representation**:
- In denary representation, 0s on far left are usually omitted
- Extends to number zero (which can be written as 00 or 0)
- Does not cause confusion when using comma notation and expanded binary form

**Euclid's Algorithm in Expanded Binary Notation**:
- Can be implemented using a Turing machine that operates on pairs of numbers written in expanded binary notation
- More eficient than unary numbering system, which would show up in device efficiency and external paper usage.

#### Expanded Binary Operations and the Church-Turing Thesis

**Turing Machines and their Operations**

**Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
- Adding two numbers: can be achieved by a Turing machine
- Multiplying numbers: can be achieved by XN x 2 Turing machine
- Division with remainder: also achievable on Turing machines

**Turing Machines vs. Unary Notation**:
- Adding one in expanded binary notation is more complicated than unary notation (UN + 1)
- Multiplying by two is simpler in expanded binary notation than unary notation (XN x 2)

**Complexity of Turing Machines**:
- Turing machines can perform more complex algorithmic tasks once basic arithmetic operations are established
- The ultimate scope of these devices is to perform any mechanical operation, as defined by the Church-Turing thesis

**Expanded Notations and Tape Configurations**:
- Allowing multiple tapes or symbols does not expand the class of achievable operations
- A single tape can be extended to accommodate more data if needed

**Parallelism in Turing Machines**:
- Having multiple separate devices doesn't gain anything in principle, as they can be treated as a single device if necessary.

#### Turing Machines and Computability Exploration

**Turing Machines and Computability**

**Background**:
- Concept of a Turing machine proposed by Alan Turing to address Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem (question of algorithmic procedure)
- Equivalent proposals from Church, Kleene, and Post
- Church-Turing Thesis: Turing machine concept defines what is computationally effective or mechanical

**Natural Numbers**:
- Single Turing machines can handle natural numbers of arbitrarily large size
- No need to question original mathematical form of the Church-Turing Thesis

**More Complicated Types of Numbers**:
- Negative numbers, fractions, and infinite decimals handled as special cases of natural numbers
- Digit generation procedure exists for generating decimal expansions of irrational numbers
- Some irrationals cannot be generated by any Turing machine (non-computable)

**Computability in Mathematics**:
- Turing machines can operate on mathematical formulae and formal calculus manipulations with proper coding
- Important concept in mathematics, not just limited to numbers.

#### Universal Turing Machine Coding for Numbering Turing Machines

**Turing Machines Coding**

**Coding Scheme:**
- Code list of instructions for a Turing machine into a string of 0s and 1s using:
  - Symbols R, L, STOP, arrow (), and comma represented as contractions: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
  - Digits 0 and 1 coded as 0 and 10, respectively
- Economize by leaving out arrow symbols, digits preceding them, commas, initial 110 or final 110 (with infinite blank tape following), and using the numerical ordering of instructions to specify what those symbols must be

**Example:** Turing machine XN + 1
- Leave out arrows, digits preceding them, and commas
- Code sequence: 10101101101001011010100111010010110101111 01000011101001010111010001011101010001101
- Delete initial 110 and final 110 (and infinite sequence of 0s following it)
- Binary number: 450813704461563958982113775643437908

**Other Examples:**
- UN + 1: binary number 177642, denary notation
- XN  2: binary number 10389728107, denary notation

**Not all Natural Numbers Have Working Turing Machines:**
- Majority do not give working Turing machines at all.

**First 13 Turing Machines:**
- **T 0**: moves on to the right obliterating everything
- **T 1**: ultimately achieves the same eect, but clumsily
- **T 2**: leaves everything on the tape as it was before (never stops)
- **T 3**: first respectable machine, changes rst (leftmost) 1 into a 0
- **T 4**: encounters problem with no listing for an internal state
- **T 8**, **T 9**, and **T 10**: encounter the same problem as T 4
- **T 7**: gets stuck when it finds its rst 1 on the tape due to a sequence of five consecutive 1s
- **T 5**, **T 6**, and **T 12**: encounter similar problems as T 0, T 1, and T 2 (never stop)

#### Universal Turing Machines Construction and Implications

**Turing Machines**

**List of Non-Functioning Machines**:
- T 0, T 1, T 2, T 4, T 5, T 6 (twice), T 8, T 9, T 10, and T 12 are duds
- Only T 3 and T 11 are working Turing machines, but not very interesting

**Redundancy in List**:
- T 6 is identical with T 0 and T 12
- This redundancy cannot be fully removed without complicating the universal Turing machine

**Interpreting the Tape Representation**:
- The tape with infinite 0s at both ends, ending with a non-zero number of 1s, represents the binary representation of some natural number
- Zero is also represented as an infinitely repeating sequence of 0s
- Reading the string between the first and last 1 as the binary description gives all natural numbers

**Turing Machine Behavior on Tape Input**:
- A Turing machine's behavior on a finite input string can be interpreted as producing another binary number, which represents the answer to a calculation
- This operation is an algorithmic procedure that can be carried out by a Universal Turing Machine (U) on the pair of numbers (n, m)

**Universal Turing Machine**:
- The U machine reads the binary representation of n and m from its input tape
- At each step, it examines the digits in n to determine the appropriate replacement for m's digits
- This procedure is tedious but possible to construct, leading to a universal Turing machine that can mimic any Turing machine

**Size of Universal Turing Machine**:
- The number encoding the U machine is large but unavoidable for a universal Turing machine design

**Comparison with Modern Computers**:
- Modern general-purpose computers are essentially universal Turing machines, despite not resembling the U machine design

#### Turing Machine Halting Problem and Mathematical Undecidability

**Turing Machines and the Halting Problem**
- **Purpose**: Turing originally proposed his ideas to resolve Hilbert's broad-ranging Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem)
- **Halting Problem**: Phrase of whether a given Turing machine will halt or not when applied to a particular input number `m`
- **Importance**: Deciding whether a Turing machine halts is crucial as an algorithm that runs forever without stopping is essentially useless
- **Example: Fermat's Last Theorem**
  - Unsolved problem in mathematics about whether there exist natural numbers `w, x, y, z` satisfying an equation
  - Could be phrased as a Turing machine halting problem
- **Example: Goldbach Conjecture**
  - Assertion that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers
  - Can be tested algorithmically by checking divisibility of the given even number by primes up to its square root
  - Turing machine devised to decide whether an even number is a sum of two primes or not
- **Deciding Halting Problem**
  - Difficulty lies in determining whether a particular Turing machine halts for all possible inputs
- **Turing's Argument against Solving the Halting Problem Algorithmically**:
  - Assumes existence of algorithm `H` that decides whether a given Turing machine halts or not when applied to `m`
  - The universal Turing machine (U) can be constructed to simulate `H` and hence solve the halting problem for any Turing machine
- **Conclusion**: There is no algorithmic procedure to decide the halting problem of all possible Turing machines.

#### Diagonalization Argument Proving Non-Existence of Turing Machine Halting Problem Solver

**The Undecidability of Turing Machines**

**Imagining an Infinite Array**:
- Lists all the outputs of all possible Turing machines acting on various inputs
- Each row displays the output of a specific Turing machine, as applied to different inputs

**Cheating for a More Interesting List**:
- The author has "cheated a little" by not listing Turing machines in order
- This makes the list look more interesting than just having rows of 's or 0's

**Defining Computable Sequences**:
- A **computable sequence** is an infinite sequence whose successive values can be generated by an algorithm
- There is some Turing machine that can generate such a computable sequence when given the natural numbers as inputs

**The Diagonal Slash Argument**:
- Consider the elements of the main diagonal, marked with bold 's
- Add 1 to each term in this sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 8, 2, ...
- This is a computable procedure that generates a new computable sequence: 1 + Tn(nn) * H(nn)
- The table contains every computable sequence, so this new sequence must be somewhere in the list
- However, this new sequence differs from the first term in each row of the table, which is a contradiction
- This establishes that there is no algorithm to decide whether a Turing machine stops or not (Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem)

**Deciding Individual Cases**:
- For some Turing machines and inputs, the question of whether it stops can be decided by intuition or common sense
- But there is no single algorithm that works for all mathematical questions or Turing machines

#### The Limits of Algorithms Churchs Lambda Calculus

**The Undecidability of Algorithms and Computability**

**Turings Argument**:
- Shows that there is no algorithm to determine if all Turing machines will halt or not
- Provides a method for constructing a Turing machine that defeats a given algorithm
- This contradiction shows the algorithm cannot be correct

**Finding the Contradictory Turing Machine**:
- To find the contradictory Turing machine, we need to examine the construction of the algorithm (H) and the Turing machine (Tn)
- By looking at the diagonal terms, we can identify a specific Turing machine (k) that defeats the algorithm
- This process is complicated but well-defined, and could potentially be automated into an algorithm itself

**The Meaning of "Knowing"**:
- When discussing algorithms, it is important to consider what "knowing" means
- Is it the algorithm that knows, or are we the ones doing the knowing?
- This raises questions about mathematical truth and the limitations of algorithms

**Computability and Mathematical Puzzles**:
- The concept of computability is a fundamental idea in mathematics
- It is interesting because some well-defined operations are non-computable, which challenges mathematicians
- The general solution to determining computability is also non-computable, making it an intriguing puzzle

#### Abstract Mathematics Lambda Calculus for Computability

**Computability as a Mathematical Concept**

**Computability**:
- Genuine absolute mathematical concept
- Abstract idea that lies beyond any particular realization in terms of Turing machines
- Turing machines are one way to express the idea, but not the only way
- Other approaches include Church's lambda calculus and Kleene's work

**Church's Lambda Calculus**:
- Designed to illustrate computability as a mathematical concept
- Abstract in its essence, focusing on mathematical operations or functions
- Functions can take other functions as arguments, with the result also being a function
- The operation of **abstraction** allows for simplifying complex expressions into abstracted functions
- Examples: sine function, power operations (cubing), iterating functions like multiplication and exponentiation

**Expressing Arithmetic Operations**:
- Church's scheme can express arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication using elementary functional operations
- For example, **S** is the function that adds a given number to another number
- Other basic arithmetical operations (subtraction, division) are more difficult to define in this framework

#### Universal Turing Machine Coding and Algorithm Improvements

**Notes on Computability and Universal Turing Machines**

**Background:**
- Discovery of computability in the early 1930s by Kleene, Church, and Turing
- Church's notion of computability has fundamental relations to practical computing
- LISP language incorporates Church's calculus structure
- Various ways to define computability (Post's machine, recursiveness)

**Universal Turing Machines:**
- Concept remains the same despite differing approaches
- Turings original one vs. modern ones (more practical but less straightforward)
- Platonic reality of mathematical concepts

**Computability and Practical Computing:**
- Church's notion of computability has fundamental relations to practical computing
- LISP language incorporates Church's calculus in an essential way

**Defining Computability:**
- Post's concept of computing machine was very close to Turing's, produced independently at almost the same time
- Currently more usable definition of computability (recursiveness) due to Herbrand and Gdel
- Curry and Schnfelds approach somewhat earlier than Church's calculus

**Universal Turing Machines:**
- Concept remains constant despite various approaches
- Can be defeated by applying the same procedure iteratively, leading into complex considerations discussed in connection with Gdel's theorem.

### 3 Mathematics And Reality

**Background:**
- Imaginary journey to an unknown world, TorBled-Nam
- Remote sensing device reveals strange landscape (Fig. 3.1)
- Island with various tributaries and warts

**Further Examination:**
1. Enlarging the image:
   - Revealed larger object resembling the island but not identical
   - Complex structure with numerous protuberances, laments, and spiral formations
2. Analyzing a wart:
   - Resembles creature as a whole but different at attachment point
   - Various places exhibit numerical patterns (veness, sevenness, nineness)
3. Entering crevices:
   - Discovering smaller warts and swirling activity

4. Examining a spiral tail:
   - Complex structure made up of tiny spirals and other forms (Fig. 3.5)
   - Revealing a baby creature (Fig. 3.6 and 3.7) almost identical to parent
5. Conclusion:
   - TorBled-Nam is not an actual land or landscape but a mathematical concept, the Mandelbrot set.

**The Mandelbrot Set:**
- Complex number system including real and imaginary parts
- Generated by simple rule yet displays infinite complexity.

#### Real Numbers and Their Extensions Infinite Decimal Expansions

**Complex Numbers and Real Numbers**

**Real Numbers**:
- Natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...
- Quantified by the use of natural numbers
- Can be added or multiplied to produce new natural numbers
- Need negative numbers for systematic subtraction
- Extended to include **rational numbers** (fractions) and **real numbers** (infinite decimal expansions)
- Includes square roots, cube roots, etc. of positive real numbers

**Complex Numbers**:
- Absolutely fundamental to the structure of quantum mechanics and the workings of the world
- A Great Miracle of Mathematics
- Can be represented as **imaginary** (purely imaginary) or **complex** (includes both real and imaginary components) numbers

**Complex Number Representation**:
- In Cartesian form: a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part
- Magnitude (modulus): |a + bi| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
- Argument (phase): arg(a + bi) = atan2(b, a)

#### Uncountable Real Numbers Cantors Diagonal Argument

**The Complexity of Real Numbers**

**Computable Numbers vs. Real Numbers**:
- Computable numbers are "awkward" to work with, as one cannot keep all operations computable
- Deciding whether two computable numbers are equal is not a computable task
- Prefer to work with **all real numbers**, which can have any decimal expansion

**Counting Real Numbers**:
- The number of integers and natural numbers is the same, denoted as 0 (aleph nought)
- Fractions, integers, and natural numbers can be put into one-to-one correspondence
- These sets are called **countable**

**Uncountable Sets**:
- There exist sets that are not countable, such as the real numbers
- The argument uses a diagonal slash to show there is no one-to-one correspondence between real numbers and natural numbers
- This establishes the real numbers are greater than the rational numbers and uncountable

**The Continuum Hypothesis**:
- The symbol **C** stands for the system of real numbers, also called the continuum
- It is an unsolved problem whether C = 1 (the next infinite number) is true or not

#### Complex Number System A Mathematical Extension of Real Numbers

**Diagonal Procedure and Real Numbers**

**Halting Problem**:
- Some Turing machines may produce digits of a real number but get stuck, unable to produce another digit
- There is no computable method to determine which Turing machines will get stuck

**Computability vs. Real Numbers**:
- Real numbers are called "real" because they seem to provide magnitudes for measurement
- However, the relationship between abstract real numbers and physical quantities is not as clear-cut as it may seem
- At very small scales (e.g., quantum gravity), the concept of distance or time may have limited meaning

**Real Number System in Physics**:
- Chosen for mathematical utility, simplicity, elegance, and agreement with physical concepts over a wide range
- However, it is not clear that this agreement extends to very tiny scales or vast distances (e.g., quasars)
- Familiar concept of real-number distance may hold up to 10^60 orders of magnitude, though extrapolation from limited experience

**Complex Numbers**:
- Real number system has limitations, such as the inability to take square roots of negative numbers
- Postulate the existence of i, such that i^2 = 1, and extend this to all real numbers
- Complex numbers are formed by combining real and imaginary parts (a + ib)
- Rules for adding and multiplying complex numbers follow ordinary algebraic rules with the added condition i^2 = 1

#### Geometrical Representation of Complex Numbers and the Mandelbrot Set

**Understanding Complex Numbers and the Argand Plane**

**The Importance of Complex Numbers**:
- Provide the ability to take square roots, cube roots, etc.
- Has applications in various mathematical fields
- Euler proved their usefulness in simplifying trigonometric formulas

**Representing Complex Numbers: The Argand Plane**
- Complex number z = x + iy represented by a point (x, y) on the Argand plane
  - 0 is at the origin, 1 is located on the real axis
- Allows for visual organization of complex numbers in a geometrically useful way

**Basic Operations with Complex Numbers**
- **Addition**: Represented as vector sum of two points (parallelogram law)
- **Multiplication**: Distance from origin and angle relative to real axis determined by the angles between 0, 1, u, and v

**The Mandelbrot Set**
- Complex numbers can be visualized using the Argand plane
- The Mandelbrot set is a deformation of the complex number plane that has been used to generate intricate patterns through iterations.

#### Iterated Function Systems and the Realness of Mathematical Structures

**The Mandelbrot Set: Bounded vs Unbounded Complex Numbers**

**Concept:**
- Arbitrary complex number z represented as a point on Argand plane
- Mapping: z replaced by new complex number z + c, where c is given

**Bounded Sequence:**
- Replacement rule: replace 0 with c, then apply sequence iteratively
  - Example: if c = 1.63i4.2, 3 becomes 9+1.63i4.2; 2.7+0.3 becomes (2.7)+(0.3)+c
- Sequence remains within some fixed circle for certain choices of c (Mandelbrot set)
  - Examples: c=0, c=1, c=i
- Sequences can be visualized on Argand plane as a series of points
- Bounded sequences do not wander far from origin

**Unbounded Sequence:**
- Some choices of c result in unbounded sequences that cannot be contained within any fixed circle
  - Example: c=1, sequence: 0, 1, 2, 5, 26, ...; c=3, sequence: 0, 3, 6, 33, ...; c=i1, sequence: 0, i, i1, i1, ...
- Unbounded sequences wander farther and farther from origin to infinite distance

**The Mandelbrot Set:**
- Region in Argand plane consisting of points c for which the sequence remains bounded (black region)
- White region consists of unbounded sequences
- Detailed pictures drawn from outputs of computers, based on criterion whether sequence is bounded or not.

**Philosophical Question:**
- What reality do mathematical concepts have?
  - Seem arbitrary mental idealizations but may reveal some external truth with its own reality.
- The Mandelbrot set as an example: complex structure not invented by a particular person, revealed partially to individuals through computation.

#### The Eternal Nature of Mathematics and Complex Numbers Invention or Discovery

**The Mandelbrot Set and Complex Numbers**
- The Mandelbrot set is a fundamental mathematical structure discovered through computer analysis of complex numbers
- It was not an invention but a discovery, like Mount Everest
- The system of complex numbers has a profound reality beyond mental constructions
- Cardano's work on algebra in the 16th century led to the understanding of complex numbers
  - He noticed that taking square roots of negative numbers allowed for solving equations
  - Raphael Bombelli extended Cardano's work and began the study of complex numbers
- Complex numbers have properties beyond their original purpose, such as the Cauchy integral formula, Riemann mapping theorem, Lewy extension property
- Mathematics can be seen as both discovery and invention
  - Discoveries are more compelling and universal than inventions
  - Inventions are works of man with limited scope compared to discoveries
- Plato's philosophical views on mathematics support the idea that mathematical concepts have a timeless, ethereal existence.

#### Exploring Non-Algorithmic Mathematics Beyond Mandelbrot Sets

**Chapter 8: The Role of Algorithms in Understanding Mental Phenomena**

**Algorithmic versus Non-algorithmic Mathematics**
- Discussion of strong AI perspective and its connection to algorithmic ideas (Chapter 1)
- Importance of mathematical notions, including algorithms (Chapter 2)
- Arguments for a timeless existence for mathematical concepts
- Possible credence given to strong AI viewpoint
- Belief that mental phenomena may not reside within the concept of an algorithm

**Mandelbrot Set**
- Discussion of Mandelbrot set and its complexities (Chapters 1, 8)
- Uncertainty regarding discovery vs. invention of the Mandelbrot set

**Mathematical Perspective**
- Demand for a rule determining digits in arbitrary real numbers
- Consistency with unconventional point of view

**Notes**
1. Mandelbrot (1986) and Peitgen & Richter (1986) provided further information on the Mandelbrot set, including coloured illustrations. For more striking illustrations, see Peitgen & Saupe (1988).
2. Debate over who first discovered the Mandelbrot set; supporters of discovery viewpoint believe it was a natural finding rather than an invention within a formal system.
3. Consistent point of view: there should always be some rule determining digits in arbitrary real numbers, even if not effective or definable within a preassigned formal system.

### 4 Truth, Proof, And Insight

**Mathematical Truth**

**Background:**
- Old question: What is mathematical truth?
- Simplified by focusing on mathematical judgements
- Confidence in powerful methods of proof shattered with Russell's paradox (1902)
- Previous advances from Greek philosophers and mathematicians like Hilbert, Cantor, Poincar

**Sets and Properties:**
- Concept of sets as completed wholes
  - Characterized by properties (e.g., redness = set of all red things)
- Freges definition of numbers: totalities of equivalent sets
  - Number 3: set of all sets with the property of having exactly three members

**Russell's Paradox:**
- Set R defined as the set of all sets not belonging to themselves
- Contradiction arises when asking if R is a member of itself or not
- Same type of reasoning used in earlier mathematical proofs led to paradox
- Need for more precise reasoning and avoiding contradictions

**Conclusion:**
- Mathematical truth is an essential question with significant implications
- Past developments provided insights but also challenges, as seen through Russell's paradox.

#### Formalization of Mathematical Systems Hilberts Program and Gdels Theorem

**Formal Mathematical Systems**

**Overview:**
- Russell and Whitehead developed a formal system to translate mathematical reasoning into their scheme, preventing paradoxes
- Hilbert aimed for a comprehensive scheme that would prove consistency of mathematical area
- Kurt Gdel's theorem destroyed Hilbert's program due to undecidable statements

**Formal Mathematical System:**
- Alphabet of symbols including natural number notation and logical operators
- Need space symbol, variables (t, u, v...), arithmetic operations, brackets, and logical symbols
- Propositions: Fermat's theorem example using capital letters P, Q, R...
- Axioms: self-evident propositions like truth of conjunction or negation
- Rules of procedure for deriving new propositions from established ones

**Building Up Theorems:**
- Starting with axioms and applying rules of procedure to build up long list of propositions called theorems
- Prove specific proposition P by finding a correctly assembled list terminating in P.

#### Godels Incompleteness Theorem and Formal Systems

**Hilbert's Programme and Godel's Theorem**

**Background:**
- Hilbert's programme: find a comprehensive system of axioms and rules for arithmetic to incorporate all correct mathematical reasoning
- Goal: enable decision on truth or falsity of any statement within the system
- Hope: achieve completeness (proof either P or ~P) and consistency (no string both true and false)
- Problem: Godel's theorem

**Godel's Argument:**
- Central idea: create a propositional function that asserts there is no proof of a specific proposition
- Propositional function: ~x[x proves Pw(w)]
  - Part in square brackets: well-defined arithmetical statement about two natural numbers x and w
  - Negated existential quantifier removes one variable, leaving an arithmetical proposition dependent on w only
  - Statement asserts there is no proof for Pw(w)

**Godel's Theorem:**
- Showing that such statements can be coded into arithmetic is the major effort in Godel's argument
- Complicated part: coding individual rules of procedure and axioms into arithmetical operations
- No proof of Pw(w) if Pw(w) is not syntactically correct, but statement remains true.

#### Incompleteness of Formal Systems The Self-Referential Proof

**Gdel's Theorem and Unprovable Statements**

**Introduction:**
- Dependency on numbering systems and formal system details
- Assignment of numbers to propositional functions (k)
- Discussion of Pk(k), a specific proposition

**Properties of Pk(k):**
1. True statement: proven through argument
2. No proof within the formal system
3. Implications for formalists' notion of truth
   a. Incomplete according to strict formalists
   b. Pragmatic viewpoint questionable

**Alternative Perspectives:**
- Simple mathematical statements equivalent to Gdel propositions
- Formalists' lack of interest in mathematical truth strange

**Procedure Suggestion:**
1. Accept Pk(k) as valid proposition
2. Adjoin it to the system as an additional axiom
3. Repeat process with resulting system and its Gdel proposition
4. Continue indefinitely, forming a list of unlimited axioms.

#### The Limits of Formal Systems and Mathematical Intuition

**The Systematic Expansion of Formal Systems**

**Gdel Propositions**:
- Any true, universally quantified proposition in arithmetic can be obtained through a repeated Gdelization procedure
- Leads to a new system and a new Gdel proposition (e.g., G2, G2+1, G2+2, etc.)

**The Procedure**:
- Entirely systematic and has its own Gdel proposition (G2)
- However, it requires systematizing the adjoining of an infinite family of Gdel propositions into a single additional axiom

**Referential Principles**:
- Provide insights that go beyond the rigid confines of formal systems
- Involve reasoning about infinite sets, which must be done carefully to avoid paradoxes
- Enable obtaining new mathematical insights not deducible from existing axioms and rules

**Comparison to Russell's Paradox**:
- Similarities between the arguments establishing unprovability of Pk(k) and the Russell paradox
- Historical connection between Turing's argument, Gdel's theorem, and Russells paradox

**The Limits of Formalism**:
- Strict formalist viewpoint does not hold together
- Attempts to avoid reasoning with enormous sets still have limitations
- Mathematical truth goes beyond mere formalism

**Intuition in Mathematics**:
- Deciding on axioms and rules requires intuitive understanding of self-evident truths
- Concepts like self-consistency are not adequate for this purpose

#### Mathematical Platonism and Intuitionism Philosophical Perspectives on Set Existence

**Gdel's Theorem and Platonism in Mathematics**

**Platonism vs Formalism**:
- Gdel's theorem shows that the formalist perspective on mathematical truth is not tenable
- Platonistic view: Mathematical truth is absolute and God-given, beyond the concept of formalism

**Distinctions within Platonism**:
- Distinction between the existence of mathematical objects and the absolute nature of mathematical truth
- Whether mathematical concepts have actual existence or just an abstract, conceptual existence

**Platonic Existence vs Absolute Truth**:
- The Mandelbrot set's existence is tied to its absolute nature, independent of specific mathematicians or computers
- Controversy around wildly enormous and nebulously constructed sets, which may seem like "matters of opinion" rather than absolute truth

**Platonistic Viewpoints**:
- Gdel was a strong Platonist, accepting the absolute truth/falsity of even controversial mathematical statements
- Other Platonists may limit their Platonism to reasonably constructive sets

**Intuitionism as an Alternative**:
- Initiated by L. E. J. Brouwer in 1924 as a response to the paradoxes of infinite sets
- Rejects the law of the excluded middle and constructive existence, only accepting mathematical objects that can be explicitly constructed

**Brouwerian Intuitionism vs Ordinary Mathematics**:
- Rejects non-constructive proofs by contradiction, as they don't provide a means to actually construct the object in question
- Sees this kind of existence as "meaningless" and refuses to accept it as true

#### Turing-Inspired Proofs of Gdels Incompleteness Theorems

**Brouwer's Ideas (1924)**
- Put forward ideas more than ten years before Church and Turing's work
- Intuitionism: denies use of powerful arguments within mathematics, makes subjective truth claims
  * Example: existence of a succession of twenty consecutive sevens in the decimal expansion of pi
    + Intuitionists would not accept this as true or false until constructively proven
    + Direct calculation not feasible due to computational complexity
    + More likely to be established mathematically, but not intuitionistically acceptable
  * Similar issues with Fermat's Last Theorem
- Extreme form of intuitionism: mathematical truth is subjective and time-dependent
  * Not accepted by most present-day mathematicians due to its limitations in reasoning

**Brouwer vs. Platonism (Present-Day Mathematical Philosophy)**
- Brouwer's intuitionism: denies absolute, external mathematical truth; focuses on human society and physical objects
- Present-day Platonists: believe mathematical truth is absolute, eternal, not dependent on man-made criteria or physical objects
  * My sympathies lie with the Platonistic view
  * Important for understanding later concepts

**Gdel's Theorem and Its Derivatives (Turing's Argument)**
- Three main streams of mathematical philosophy: formalism, Platonism, intuitionism
- Emphasized the undecidability of axiom consistency as historically important but not for understanding truth proposition
- Turing derived key aspects of Gdel's result through his own argument to establish insolubility of the halting problem
  * A formal system must have an algorithm for checking proofs, but not necessarily finding them.
  * An algorithm exists to find a proof when one does exist within any formal system.

#### Recursively Enumerable Sets and Gdels Incompleteness Theorems Set-theoretic Interpretation of Turing Machines and Formal Systems

**Hilbert's Program and Gdel's Theorem**

**Symbolic Language**:
- System formulated in terms of some symbolic language, expressible in a finite alphabet of symbols
- Ordered lexicographically (alphabetically for each fixed length of string)

**Listing Proofs and Theorems**:
- List of all correctly constructed proofs numerically ordered according to the lexicographical scheme
- Corresponding list of all theorems of the formal system, as the last lines of those proofs
- Computable listing by testing each string in the list using a proof-testing algorithm

**Hilbert's Program and Completeness**:
- If Hilbert's scheme was successful, it would provide a general algorithmic method to decide truth or falsity of any proposition within the system
- This would contradict Turing's result that there is no general algorithm for deciding mathematical propositions
- Gdel's theorem establishes that no formal system of Hilbert's intended type can be complete in the sense discussed

**Recursively Enumerable Sets**:
- Concerned with sets (finite or infinite) of natural numbers 0, 1, 2, ...
- Includes sets like {4, 5, 8}, {0, 57, 100003}, {6}, {0}, {1, 2, 3, ..., 9999}, {1, 2, 3, ...}, and the entire set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...} or the empty set
- Focuses on computability issues: Which sets of natural numbers can be generated by algorithms and which cannot?
- Identifying natural numbers with propositions in a formal system, using known algorithms to convert between them.

**Choosing a Formal System**:
- The chosen formal system is consistent and broad enough to include all actions of all Turing machines
- Its axioms and rules of procedure are self-evidently true

#### Undecidable Propositions and Incomplete Formals Systems

**Properties of Recursively Enumerable Sets:**
- A set, such as P, that can be generated by an algorithm is called recursively enumerable.
- The set of propositions disprovable within a formal system (i.e., their negations are provable) is also recursively enumerable.
- Simple examples of recursively enumerable sets include: even numbers, squares, primes, and their complements.
- A set that has both the set and its complementary set recursively enumerated is called a recursive set.

**Properties of Recursive Sets:**
- Both the set and its complementary set are recursively enumerable in a recursive set.
- The complement of a recursive set is also a recursive set.

**Recursively Enumerable but Not Recursive Sets:**
- A set that is recursively enumerable but not recursive would mean that there exists an algorithm to generate its elements, but no algorithm for generating the complementary set.
- The question of whether such a situation arises is whether or not there are recursively enumerated sets that are not recursive.

**Turing Machines and the Set P:**
- The set P consists of propositions provable within a formal system.
- Turings fundamental result states that there is no algorithm to determine when a Turing machine will stop for all natural numbers n (S(n)).
- The false S(n) are not recursively enumerable, so the complement of set P cannot be recursively enumerated either.
- This establishes that the set P is not recursive and demonstrates that the formal system cannot be complete, as there must be undecidable propositions neither provable nor disprovable within it.

#### Algorithmic Boundaries of Complicated Sets Mandelbrot Set and Gdels Theorem

**Gdel's Theorem: Recursive vs. Recursively Enumerable Sets**

**Recursive Sets**:
- Represent the true propositions of a formal system
- Are not recursive or recursively enumerable
- True propositions are more complicated than provable within the system
- Simple classes of arithmetical propositions form recursively enumerable sets (e.g., those involving functions constructed from basic operations)

**The Mandelbrot Set**:
- Exhibits an endless variety of highly elaborate structure, defying algorithmic systematization
- Computer generates the Mandelbrot set by applying a simple map repeatedly to a complex number c
- Determining if a point in the Argand plane belongs to the Mandelbrot set involves knowing what happens after an infinite number of terms
- The complement of the Mandelbrot set (white region) is recursively enumerable, but whether the Mandelbrot set itself (black region) has an algorithm for belonging is unknown.

#### Complicated Set Theory in Mandelbrot Set Discussion Recursive Enumerability and Local Connectedness

**Recursively Enumerable Sets and Complex Numbers**

**Issues to Address**:
- The term "recursively enumerable" and "recursive" should only be used for countable sets like natural numbers, not complex numbers.
- The real numbers are uncountable, and the complex numbers cannot be countable due to their relationship with real numbers.

**Problem of Equality of Computable Complex Numbers**:
- There is no general algorithm for deciding whether two given computable complex numbers are equal or not, unlike with computable real numbers.
- This problem arises because the decimal expansions of the real and imaginary parts of a complex number may not converge to 0 or 1, making it impossible to determine if they are on the unit circle or not.

**Unit Disc as Recursive Set**:
- The unit disc should count as recursive but requires an appropriate viewpoint.
- One way around this problem is to ignore the boundary and only consider points in the interior or exterior, where algorithms exist to determine their position.

**Alternative Perspective: Recursively Enumerable Sets**:
- Another approach is to design an algorithm that decides if a given complex number lies within the set or its complement, without needing to generate digits of the real and imaginary parts.
- This perspective also ignores boundaries, considering only the interior and exterior of the unit disc as recursively enumerable sets.

**Mandelbrot Set Complexity**:
- When applied to the Mandelbrot set, ignoring boundaries may miss its complexity, particularly the tendrils which do not lie in the interior of the set.
- The Mandelbrot set's recursive enumerability depends on whether it is locally connected, a term whose relevance and meaning need clarification.

#### Non-Algorithms in Mathematics Diophantine Equations and Word Problems

**Non-Recursive Mathematics**

**Complex Numbers**:
- Complex numbers are not countable, but subsets can be defined that are computable
- Examples: Rational complex numbers with rational real and imaginary parts, algebraic numbers (solutions to algebraic equations)
- Algebraic numbers are countable and computable, but may not fully resolve the algorithmic nature of the Mandelbrot set boundary

**Examples of Non-Recursive Mathematics**:
- Diophantine equations: Systems of algebraic equations with integer coefficients
  - The problem is to find integer solutions, if any
  - No general algorithm exists for this
- Topological equivalence of manifolds (3D and above)
  - Equivalence not known for dimensions 3 and higher
  - Could be relevant to quantum gravity in 4D space-time
- Word problem: Given a set of word equations, can two words be derived from each other using those equations?
  - Difficulty lies in the complexity of possible substitutions

**Word Problem**:
- Given an initial list of word equalities (E.g., EAT = AT)
- Derive further equalities by making substitutions
- Determine if two words can be derived from each other using these rules
- Examples: Caterpillar to Man, Carpet to Meat

#### Non-recursive Mathematics Word Problem and Tiling of Plane

**Caterpillar Transformation**

**Changes:**
- Caterpillar: C A R P I L L A R
- Carpet: C A R P E T
- Man: M A N
- Meat: M E A T
- Low: C A R P I L O W

**Comparison:**
1. Number of As, Ws, and Ms is the same on both sides in every equality.
2. Total number of As, Ws, and Ms differs between CARPET (1) and MEAT (2).
3. No way to get from CARPET to MEAT by allowed substitutions.

**General Word Problem:**
- Algorithm for establishing equality when words are equal: lexicographical listing of all possible sequences, strike non-consecutive unequal pairs.
- Deciding when two words are not equal is more complex and may require intelligence.
- No single algorithm can be used universally for all initial lists (non-recursive mathematics).

**Specific Word Problem:**
- Initial list: C A R P E T, M A T E N, M A N, C A R P I L O W, L O W.
- There is no algorithm for deciding when two words are unequal using this initial list (non-recursive mathematics).

**Periodic Tilings:**
- Examples: squares, equilateral triangles, regular hexagons, irregular pentagons, versatile tile shapes.
- Periodic tilings have a period parallelogram that reproduces the pattern when repeated in two directions.
- Non-periodic tilings do not reproduce the pattern periodically but still cover the entire plane.

**Non-Periodic Tilings:**
- Raphael Robinson's set of six tiles (Figure 4.10) will tile the entire plane only in a non-periodic way.

**History:**
- Hao Wang addressed the question of whether there is a decision procedure for the tiling problem.
- If every finite set of distinct tiles that tile the plane also tiles it periodically, then there would be an algorithm to decide whether a given set tiles the plane or not (decision procedure).

#### Non-Recursive Geometry Exploring the Mandelbrot Sets Complexity

**Non-Periodic Tiling Problem**

**History:**
- Discovered non-periodic tilings in the late 1960s, following Hao Wang's leads
- Robert Berger exhibited the first aperiodic set of tiles with 20,426 di erent ones; later reduced to 104 by Raphael Robinson
- In 1971, Robinson further reduced the number to six tiles (Fig. 4.10)
- Another set of six non-periodic tiles was produced independently in about 1973 (Fig. 4.11)
- Reduced the number of tiles to two sets by slicing and re-gluing (Fig. 4.12)

**Properties:**
- Aperiodic patterns exhibit crystallographically impossible quasi-periodic structures with fivefold symmetry
- Non-recursive mathematics, as Wang, Berger, and Robinson's work was part of this area
- Many unsolved problems in this domain, including whether there exists an aperiodic single tile

**Mandelbrot Set**

**Assumption:**
- If Mandelbrot set is non-recursive, its complement would not be recursively enumerable

**Analysis:**
- Major parts of the interior can be defined by simple algorithmic equations (Fig. 4.13)
- Most evident regions and overwhelming percentage of the area can be dealt with algorithmically
- If complete set is non-recursive, hidden delicate regions would be hard to find and improve algorithms to reach them
- Process similar to how mathematics progresses in di cult, non-recursive areas.

#### Complexity of Algorithms Polynomial Time Classification

**Complexity Theory**
- Arguments about algorithms are typically at the "in principle" level
- Discussion of practicality and efficiency is complex and technical
- **Complexity theory**: concerned with limitations of algorithms for solving problems
- Complexity theory focuses on infinite families of problems with general algorithms
- Size of a problem measured by some natural number **n**
  - Greater **n**, greater number of steps required by algorithm
- **N** (number of steps) can increase more rapidly than **n**
  - Depends on type of computing machine used
- Broad categorization of ways **N** increases:
  - **P**: polynomial time, includes all rates that are at most fixed multiples of **n**, **n2**, **n3**, etc.
    - Example: multiplying two numbers belongs to P category
  - Other categories exist with even faster growth rates for **N**.

**Complexity Theory and Algorithms**:
- No single problem's solution time is discussed in complexity theory
- Instead, focus on families of problems with general algorithms
- Different sizes (n) have varying numbers of steps required (N)
  - Greater n, greater N
- P category includes all rates that are at most fixed multiples of **n**, **n2**, **n3**, etc.
- Algorithms can be developed and improved to handle specific cases better.

#### Polynomial Time Algorithms and Intractable Problems in Graph Theory

**Binary Multiplication and Addition Steps**
- Direct way to carry out multiplication: write it out in binary system
- 0  0 = 0, 0  1 = 0, 1  0 = 0, 1  1 = 1
- Number of individual binary multiplications: (n/2) * (n/2) = n/4
- Total number of steps: N = n/2 (ignoring lower order terms)
- Classes of problems with size measure n: total number of binary digits
- Polynomial time algorithm for uniformly coping with all instances within that problem class

**NP Problems**
- Problems where answers can be written down and checked in polynomial time
- Example: Finding a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph
  - Collection of vertices, connected by edges
  - Problem: Decide existence, display if exists
  - Checking procedure: Polynomial time
  - Graph representation: List pairs as binary sequence
    - 1: edge between two vertices
    - 0: no edge
  - Hamiltonian circuit checking: Verify it's a closed loop and each vertex used exactly twice.
- NP problems are intractable for large n but soluble in principle, unlike P problems which are tractable.
- NP-complete problems have polynomial time solutions that can be used to solve any other NP problem.
- Examples of NP-complete problems: Hamiltonian circuit problem and traveling salesman problem.

#### Complexity and Quantum Computing in Physical Things Potential Quantum Advancements for Problem Solving

**Complexity Theory and Computability**
- Belief that it's impossible to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time with any Turing machine-like device
- This is the most important unsolved problem in complexity theory
- Complexity theory raises questions about algorithmic solutions being useful for mental phenomena
- In later chapters, less focus on complexity theory than computability
- Potential differences between complexity theory for theoretical objects vs. physical things like brains
- Possibility of quantum computers solving problems beyond P class
- Unclear how to construct reliable physical device for a quantum computer
- Human brain may use quantum effects in problem solving and judgment formation
- May need to go beyond present-day quantum theory for potential benefits
- Difficulty understanding how actual physical devices could improve upon complexity theory for Turing machines.

#### Exploring Undecidable Problems in Set Theory and Computability

**Mathematical Concepts Discussed:**
- **Continuum hypothesis**: A statement that the real numbers form a continuum without finite subsets. It is independent of standard set theory and requires new reasoning to establish its truth or falsity (Rucker, 1984; Cohen, 1966).
- **Formalism vs. Platonism**: Formalists believe that the continuum hypothesis cannot be determined using standard formal systems because it is undecidable, while Platonists argue that it holds true or false values but requires new reasoning to ascertain (Rucker, 1984; Cohen, 1966).
- **Brouwer's fixed point theorem**: A topological theorem stating that a continuous function from a disc to itself has at least one fixed point. The problem of finding this fixed point may not be constructive in Brouwer's sense (Brouwer, undated).
- **Computability theory for real functions**: A new computational theory developed by Blum, Shub, and Smale to deal with real-valued functions, which could potentially shed light on the issues discussed.

**Mathematical Problems:**
- **Word problem for semigroups**: Finding a specific element in a semigroup that satisfies certain conditions (Hanf, 1974; Myers, 1974).
- **Tile problem**: Determining if a given set of tiles can cover the entire plane without overlapping or gaps. The solution to this problem is non-computable for some sets.

**Notes:**
- Brouwer's concerns about non-constructiveness in his proofs led him to develop new methods for solving problems (Brouwer, undated).
- Knuth (1981) provides further information on efficient algorithms for addressing these types of mathematical problems.

#### Comparison of Physics Theories Superb Useful Tentative

**Categories of Basic Physical Theories**
1. **SUPERB**: This category includes theories that apply without refutation to a phenomenal range and accuracy of phenomena in the physical world. Examples: Euclidean geometry, Archimedes' theory of statics, Pappos and Stevin's development of this theory (now subsumed by Newtonian mechanics), Galileo's dynamics, Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell's electromagnetism, Einstein's special relativity, and general relativity. Quantum mechanics is also considered SUPERB due to its accurate predictions and explanation of various inexplicable phenomena like chemical laws, atomic stability, sharpness of spectral lines, superconductivity, and laser behavior.
2. **USEFUL**: This category includes theories that have a significant impact on technology or provide new insights into certain areas. Examples: Some quantum physics theories such as those related to chemistry and metallurgy.

#### Classification of Modern Physics Theories

**Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**
- Emerged from work of Jordan, Heisenberg, Pauli, and Dirac in the 1920s and 1930s
- Formulated by Dirac in 1926-1934, made workable by Bethe, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga in 1947-1948
- Combines principles of quantum mechanics with special relativity, incorporating Maxwell's equations and a fundamental equation governing electron motion and spin

- Implication: magnetic moment value of an electron (1.001159 65246 vs. experimental value 1.001159652193)

**Current Theories in the USEFUL Category**
1. **GellMann-Zweig quark model and quantum chromodynamics (QCD)**
   - Explain hadrons (protons, neutrons, mesons, etc.) as made up of constituents called quarks
   - Interactions between quarks explained by generalization of Maxwell's theory (Yang-Mills theory)
   - Some experimental support but more untidy than SUPERB theories
2. **Glashow, Salam, Ward, and Weinberg's theory combining electromagnetic forces with weak interactions**
   - Describes leptons (electrons, muons, neutrinos; W- and Z-particles)
   - Incorporates a description of the weakly interacting particles
   - Good experimental support but less consistent than SUPERB theories

**Theory of the Big Bang Origin of the Universe**
- Plays an important role in discussions of Chapters 7 and 8
- Lacks significant experimental support compared to SUPERB theories

**Tentative Theories**
- Kaluza-Klein theories, supersymmetry/supergravity, string or superstring theories, GUT theories, inflationary scenario
- Contain original ideas with potential for advancement but lack experimental support

**Ptolemaic System**
- Ancient Greek theory of planetary motion governed by complicated circular motions
- Effective for making predictions, but became increasingly over-complicated as greater accuracy was needed
- Faded as a physical theory though it played an organizational role of historical importance

**Mendeleev's Periodic Table of Chemical Elements**
- Did not provide predictive schemes of phenomenal character on their own
- Later became correct deductions within SUPERB theories (Newtonian dynamics, quantum theory)

#### Euclidean Geometry as Physical Theory and Platos Ideal World

**Euclidean Geometry**
- Euclidean geometry is the mathematics learned in school, describing the physical space of our world with near exact accuracy
- Not a logical necessity, but an observed feature of the physical world
- Lobachevskian (hyperbolic) geometry exists, similar to Euclidean but with certain differences: sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180 degrees proportional to its area
- Dutch artist Maurits C. Escher's depiction shows the boundary as an infinite pattern with straight lines being circles meeting the boundary circle at right angles
- Lobachevskian geometry might be true on a cosmological scale, but Euclidean is an excellent approximation for ordinary scales
- Deviations from Euclidean geometry occur in Einstein's general relativity on smaller scales than cosmological ones

**Plato and Euclidean Geometry**
- Plato's view: objects of pure Euclidean geometry inhabit a distinct, more perfect world (Platonic world) accessible through intellect, not necessarily applicable to the physical world
- Mathematics should be studied for its own sake without demanding complete applicability to physical experiences
- Understanding the external world requires precise mathematics based on Plato's ideal world.

**Eudoxos of Cnidus (mathematician and astronomer)**
- A member of Plato's Academy, considered a great thinker in antiquity.

#### Real Numbers and Geometry A Historical Perspective on their Influence on Mathematics and Physics

**Euclidean Geometry: Understanding Lengths and Angles through Real Numbers**

**Introduction:**
- Euclidean geometry introduced real numbers as a crucial concept (fourth century BC)
- Eudoxos' idea for describing ratios of lengths in terms of integers
  - Criteria to determine if one length ratio is greater or equal to another
- Modern development: Precise mathematical theory by Dedekind and Weierstrass

**Eudoxos vs Modern Theorists:**
- Ancient Greeks viewed real numbers as properties of physical space (geometrical magnitudes)
  * Necessary for rigorous argument about geometrical measures, sums, and products
- Nineteenth century mathematicians prefer to think of real numbers as logically primitive
  * Construct various types of geometry based on number concepts

**Significance of Euclidean Geometry:**
- Important for scientific and mathematical thinking after its publication (300 BC)
  * Influenced Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
- Pioneering work by Archimedes using Eudoxos' theory of proportion
  * Calculated areas and volumes of various shapes before calculus was introduced.

**The Ancient Greek Approach:**
- Real numbers extracted from geometry of physical space
- Euclid's Elements (Book V) established theory of proportion
  * Set stage for scientific and mathematical thinking thereafter

**Eudoxos vs Modern Theorists:**
- Eudoxos viewed real numbers as things given in terms of geometrical magnitudes
  * Describing geometrical magnitudes using arithmetic was necessary to argue rigorously about them
- Mathematicians today prefer to think of real numbers as logically primitive
  * Construct various types of geometry starting from the concept of number.

**Eudoxos' Contribution:**
- Crisis in Greek geometry due to Pythagorean discovery of irrational numbers (2, not expressible as a fraction)
- Solution: Criteria for comparing length ratios using integers (M, N)
  * Algebraic operation on lengths: a + N > b + M and d + M > c + N
- Enabled rigorous computation of areas and volumes.

**Eudoxos' Legacy:**
- Essential ingredient in modern physical theories since Euclid's work
  * Remains unchanged from Eudoxos to Einstein.

#### Galileos Dynamics and Relativity in Motion

**The Dynamics of Galileo and Newton**

**Apollonios (c. 262-200 BC)**:
- A contemporary of Archimedes
- A great geometer with profound insights and ingenuity
- Studied the theory of conic sections (ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas), which had important influence on Kepler and Newton

**The Dynamics of Motion**:
- The ancient Greeks had a good understanding of static objects but lacked a good theory of **dynamics**, the laws governing how bodies move
- Lacked sufficient timekeeping (clocks) to accurately measure changes in position, speed, and acceleration
- Galileo's observation that a pendulum could be used as a reliable means of keeping time was a key breakthrough

**Galileo's Contributions**:
- **Velocity**: A rate of change of position with respect to time, a vector quantity (direction matters)
- **Acceleration**: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time, also a vector quantity
- Force on a body determines its acceleration, not its velocity
- In the absence of force, velocity is constant and bodies move uniformly in straight lines
- Galileo's principle of relativity: Uniform motion and rest are physically indistinguishable

**Implications for Copernicanism**:
- Before Galilean relativity, the earth's motion around the sun was a puzzle because it wasn't directly observable
- With Galilean relativity, there is no local physical meaning to the concept of "at rest"
- This has implications for how space and time should be viewed

#### Newtons Laws and Celestial Mechanics

**Galileo's Insights and Newtons Laws**

**Relativity of Space:**
- Galilean space-time: four-dimensional picture of physical reality
- Three-dimensional Euclidean spaces joined together for complete understanding
- Particles in uniform motion depicted as straight lines (world-lines)

**Understanding Gravity and Conservation of Energy:**
- Galileo's insights into conservation of energy and falling bodies
  *Objects released from rest have the same speed depending only on height*
  *Energy is neither lost nor gained, just converted between forms*
- Law of energy conservation: important physical principle derived from Newton's laws
- Descartes, Huygens, Leibniz, Euler, Kelvin made comprehensive formulations

**Additional Conservation Laws:**
- Mass, momentum, angular momentum concepts have importance later on
  *Mass and momentum are related: product of mass with velocity (Familiar examples: rocket propulsion, gun recoil)*
  *Angular momentum conservation: Earth's spin, tennis balls spin*

**Newtons Laws:**
- Three laws governing behavior of material objects in Euclidean space
  *First and second laws: uniform motion in a straight line; force equals mass times acceleration*
  *Third law: every action has an equal and opposite reaction*

**Universe Structure:**
- Consists of particles moving around under the influence of forces
- Accelerations determined by acting forces, which can be calculated using vector addition law
- Forces between particles obtained from summing individual contributions (direct line rule)
  *Gravitational force: attractive inverse square law*

**Kepler's Laws:**
- Elliptical orbits around the sun with sun at focus
- Three laws governing planetary motion
  *Newton showed that Keplers laws follow from his own scheme of things*
- Detailed corrections to elliptical orbits and other effects obtained using mathematical techniques.

#### Newtonian Determinism in Billiard-Ball Model of Reality

**Newtonian Dynamics**

**Background:**
- Success of Newton's eorts due to mathematical skills and physical insights
- Based on inverse square law of gravitation
- Deterministic system with precise dynamical equations

**Newtonian World**
- Constituent particles: points without spatial extent or rigid spheres
- Laws of force known, like gravity, electric, magnetic, nuclear forces
- Forces act along the line joining centers, magnitude depends on length
- Rigid spherical balls collide elastically with no energy loss
- Problem with triple collisions: outcome depends on which particles collide first

**Determinism and Free Will**
- Deterministic model of physical behavior
- No room for free will in this billiard-ball world
- Question of free will arises from the lack of influence on material things by a mind.

**Modeling Forces:**
- Electric forces: inverse square law, repulsion between similar particles, strength governed by electric charges
- Magnetic forces: inverse square law, different dependence on distance than electric forces
- Nuclear forces: bind particles together, extremely large at close separations but negligible at greater distances.

#### Computability in Physics Determinism vs Algorithmic Predictability

**Issue of Determinism vs Computability**
- Deterministic but non-calculable world possible
- Free will linked to non-computable ingredient in laws of universe
- Distinction between computability and determinism
  - Computability: algorithmic resolution of questions
  - Determinism: future is determined by present state

**Illustrative Example of Non-Calculable, Deterministic Universe:**
1. Model universe described as pair of natural numbers (m, n)
2. State at next instant based on whether Turing machine (Tu) halts or not
3. No algorithm for halting problem of Tu
4. Model not computable despite being deterministic

**Question of Computability in Newtonian Billiard Ball World:**
1. Deterministic but possibly non-calculable physical theory
2. Question: Does ball A ever collide with ball B?
3. Complexity: continuous variables and infinite precision required for initial data
4. Approach using rational numbers to approximate initial data
5. Guess: With rational initial data, there might be no algorithm to decide if A and B will collide
6. Full Newtonian problem more complicated than Fredkin-Toole model
7. Problem persists even with rational initial data
8. Assertion: Newtonian billiard ball world may not be computable is not straightforward.

#### Hamiltonian Mechanics A Precursor to Quantum Theory

**Possible Bulleted Notes:**

**Human Brain vs Turing Machine**
- Discussing whether human brain can outperform a Turing machine using non-computable physical laws
- Newtonian billiard ball world is computable with approximations and discrete time steps
  * Space grid and time intervals allow for velocity calculations
  * Accelerations computed using force law
- Unpredictability in Newtonian world: instability from limited initial data accuracy
  * Large changes result from small differences in initial conditions (chaos or chaotic behavior)
- Weather prediction example of unpredictability in deterministic physical laws

**Hamiltonian Mechanics**
- Superb applicability and mathematical richness of Newtonian mechanics
- Classical mechanics: theories of Nature that yield valuable mathematical ideas
  * Calculus originated from Newtonian mechanics
  * Developed by great mathematicians like Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, etc.
- Hamiltonian theory summarizes classical mechanics
- William Rowan Hamilton's contribution to Hamiltonian theory
  * Emphasized analogy between waves and particles in the Hamilton equations
  * Important for later development of quantum mechanics.

#### Visualizing Classical Systems with Phase Space

**Hamiltonian Formulation of Classical Mechanics**

**Ingredients of Hamiltonian Scheme:**
- Novel use of variables: momenta instead of velocities
- Position and momentum treated as independent quantities

**Changes in Description:**
- Two sets of equations: momentum change with time and position change with time
- Rates of change determined by positions and momenta at a given time

**Equations:**
1. **Momentum Equation**: pi/t = -H/xi, i = 1, ..., n
2. **Position Equation**: xi/t = H/pi, i = 1, ..., n

**Total Energy**:
- Hamiltonian function H: expression for total energy in terms of all position and momentum variables

**Advantages:**
- Elegant and symmetrical description of mechanics
- Applicable to various systems including Newtonian equations, Maxwell theory, special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics.

**Phase Space**:
- A large number of dimensions: one for each coordinate (x1, x2, ..., pi, pj)
- Visualize as a space that represents the entire state of a physical system
- Six dimensions for n unconstrained particles (three position coordinates and three momentum coordinates per particle)
- Complexity can't be pictured accurately but understanding the concept is essential.

#### Hamiltonian Systems and Computational Limitations

**Physics and Phase Space**

**Hamilton's Equations**:
- Define a vector field on phase space
- Determine the evolution of a system with time through this vector field
- Provides deterministic solution for entire system based on initial conditions

**Computability in Physics**:
- Assuming computable physical constants, if we start from a computable point in phase space and wait for a computable time t, does the resulting point remain computable?
  - Depends on the choice of Hamiltonian function H
  - Question is interesting but requires examination
- The concept of computable number as applied to physical measurements may be limited by measurement accuracy

**Non-Algorithmic Physical Devices**:
- Some devices may imitate non-algorithmic mathematical processes
- Such devices could potentially yield correct answers to mathematically interesting questions without algorithms
- However, the behavior of these devices might require ever-increasing accuracy in physical parameters, which is an unsatisfactory way of coding information
- Preferable to acquire information in a discrete form using devices that can take up and evolve through discrete states

**Hamiltonian Systems**:
- If Hamiltonian systems behave like this, they would require stability of behavior for clear determination of discrete states.

#### Liouvilles Theorem and Spreading Phase-Space Regions in Classical Dynamics

**The Problem of Stability in Classical Mechanics**

**Goal**: Maintain a system in a specific state without drifting into another and prevent errors from accumulating over time.

**Approach**: Use particles or sub-units with continuous parameters to represent discrete states, where each state corresponds to a region in phase space.

**Concerns**: Stability of the system as it evolves through time; potential spreading of regions in phase space leading to unpredictability.

**Liouville's Theorem**: Volume of any region in phase space remains constant under Hamiltonian evolution, but shape may change.

**Behavior of Regions in Phase Space**: Initial region R0 may distort and stretch, spreading out over an enormously larger area despite the volume remaining unchanged. This can be compared to a small drop of ink spreading throughout a large container of water.

**Implications**: Classical mechanics is essentially unpredictable due to the tendency for regions in phase space to spread outwards with time. However, despite this, Newtonian dynamics has been successful because initial states still provide some level of predictability within reasonable limits.

#### Maxwells Electromagnetic Field Theory Unifying Forces and Light

**Newtonian Mechanics vs Celestial Mechanics**
- Comparatively small number of coherent bodies (sun, planets, moons) segregated by mass
- Can ignore perturbing effects of less massive bodies and treat larger ones as acting under each other's influence
- Dynamical laws applicable to individual particles also operate at level of celestial bodies
- Treat sun, planets, and moons as particles, neglecting detailed motions of individual particles composing them
- Main uses: overall property inference, conservation laws, statistical properties for predictive behavior
- Phase space spreading effect has implications for the limitations of classical mechanics in explaining solid structures and quantum effects needed to understand them.

**Maxwell's Electromagnetic Theory vs Newtonian Picture of the World**
- Electricity and magnetism act like gravitational forces with strength depending on electric charge/magnetic pole strength
- Light can be accommodated within Newtonian framework through particle or wave concepts, but complications arise from moving electric charges giving rise to magnetic forces.
- Challenge to Newtonian picture: Michael Faraday's research on physical fields (magnetic and electric) introduced the concept of vector elds in space.

#### Maxwells Electromagnetic Waves The New Physical Reality

**Faraday's Discoveries and Maxwell's Equations**

**Prevailing Viewpoint on Electromagnetic Fields**:
- Electric and magnetic fields were not considered as real physical substances
- They were viewed as convenient mathematical auxiliaries to the Newtonian point-particle action-at-a-distance picture

**Faraday's Experimental Findings**:
- Led Faraday to believe that electric and magnetic fields are real physical entities
- Varying electric and magnetic fields might be able to push each other through empty space, producing a disembodied wave
- Light itself might consist of such waves

**Maxwell's Equations**:
- Proposed a change in the equations for electric and magnetic fields
- One implication was that electric and magnetic fields would push each other through empty space
- Electromagnetic waves would propagate at the speed of light, exhibiting interference and polarization properties of light

**Maxwell's Equations vs. Newtonian Mechanics**:
- Maxwell's equations were at variance with prevailing Newtonian wisdom where electric and magnetic fields were not considered real
- Maxwell's equations required a radical change in understanding the nature of physical reality, taking electromagnetic fields seriously as entities in their own right

**Hertz's Experimental Confirmation**:
- The existence of electromagnetic waves was experimentally confirmed by Heinrich Hertz in 1888
- This provided firm basis for Faraday's inspired hopes

#### Lorentz Equations and Runaway Particles Resolving Singularities in Electromagnetic Fields

**Computability and Wave Equation**
* Maxwell's equations imply the wave equation in regions with no charges or currents (j = 0, **= 0)
* The wave equation is a simplified version of Maxwell's equations as it focuses on a single quantity
* Solutions of the wave equation exhibit deterministic behavior but can be non-computable for certain initial data
* Pour-El and Richards showed that this non-computability cannot arise if eld data is disallowed
* This result does not contradict the expected computability of reasonable Hamiltonian systems
* Non-computability may only be relevant when measurements of arbitrarily high precision are allowed

**Lorentz Equation of Motion; Runaway Particles**
* Maxwell's equations do not provide rules for charged particle behavior, which is addressed by the Lorentz equations of motion
* Lorentz equations describe how a charged particle's velocity changes due to electric and magnetic fields
* When combined with Maxwell's equations, they form rules for time-evolution of both particles and electromagnetic fields
* Issues arise when determining the eld at a particle's location due to its own field and potential problems with rotations or distortions.

#### Special Relativity and Light Contraction Lorentz-Einstein Theory

**The Problem of Initial Data in Classical Physics**

**Dirac's Solution and Runaway Solutions**:
- In 1938, Dirac solved the problem of how to determine the behavior of particles and fields from their initial data
- However, his solution led to "runaway solutions" - particles behaving in crazy ways with spontaneous acceleration towards the speed of light
- These runaway solutions do not correspond to reality and must be ruled out by choosing the initial accelerations correctly
- This is a departure from standard deterministic physical problems, where the initial data can be given without constraint

**Determinism and Computability in Classical Equations**:
- The implications of Dirac's solution raised questions about determinism and computability in classical physical laws
- Physicists argue that this issue is more relevant to quantum electrodynamics than classical electromagnetism
- Poincar and Einstein were also concerned with the compatibility of Galilean relativity and Maxwell's equations

**The Special Theory of Relativity**:
- Einstein and Poincar independently found that Maxwell's equations satisfy a relativity principle, preserving their form under changes in reference frames
- This required modifying the laws of Galileo and Newton to be compatible with this relativistic principle
- Lorentz had partially addressed these questions, suggesting matter contracts slightly when moving at speeds comparable to the speed of light

#### Minkowskis Four-Dimensional Space-Time Concept and Light Cones

**Lorentz's Conclusion**
- Lorentz concluded that matter behaves exactly according to relativity principle underlying Maxwell equations, preventing uniform motion from being locally detected
- Limited by specific theory of matter, no other forces were considered significant

**Poincar's Contribution**
- In 1905, Poincar showed there is an exact way for matter to behave according to relativity principle under Maxwell equations
- Understood physical implications including relativity of simultaneity
- Regarded it as one possibility, did not share Einstein's conviction

**Minkowski's Insight**
- In 1908, Minkowski introduced the concept of four-dimensional space-time
- Space and time are considered together as a single entity
- Each point in space-time diagram represents an event, whole history is represented by the diagram
- Particle is not represented by a point but by a world-line; its entire existence is described

**Special Relativity Basics with Minkowski's Spacetime**
- Difficulty: Four dimensions are hard to visualize
- Space and time union preserves independent reality
- Cheating allowed in terms of lower dimensions for better understanding

**Light Cone in Minkowskian Spacetime**
- Each point in space-time has a future light cone, representing history of light ash from an explosion
- Material particles cannot travel faster than light; their world-lines lie inside the light cone at each point
- Convenient to describe photons as "classical" for better understanding, but they always travel in straight lines with fundamental speed c.

#### Minkowskian Distance in Special Relativity Time Measured by Moving Clocks

**Minkowskian Geometry and Special Relativity:**
* In three-dimensional Euclidean geometry, distance from origin r is given by Pythagorean theorem: x + y + z.
* Minkowskian geometry (also called spacetime) has similar expression with two minus signs: s = t - (x/c) - (y/c) - (z/c).
* Essential difference is that we now have spacetime instead of just space.
* Distance measure in Minkowskian geometry (s) represents time experienced by a particle between events O and P if P lies within light cone of O.
* For uniformly moving observers, correct measure of time is s, not t.
* Moving clocks run slower compared to stationary ones due to relativistic effects.
* Photons don't experience any passage of time (s = 0).
* Minkowskian distance applies to any pair of points within the light cone of each other.
* World-line representing time measured by a clock moving uniformly from one point to another.
* Twin paradox explanation using Minkowskian geometry: AC represents time experienced by stay-at-home twin, AB and BC represent traveller's time experiences during journey.
* Inequality AC > AB + BC holds true for Minkowskian triangle inequality due to different sign conventions in distance calculation compared to Euclidean geometry.

#### Time Dilation and Relative Simultaneity

**Minkowski Spacetime and Relativity Principle**
- Concept of time-measure in relativity: two twins at different velocities experience time differently
- Experimental evidence for delayed decay times of subatomic particles traveling close to the speed of light
- Nuclear clocks confirming Minkowskian distance measures
- Implications of Einstein's equation E = mc and special relativity principle
- Explanation of Poincar motion in Minkowski spacetime
  - Rigid motion preserving all Minkowskian distances
  - Uniformly moving observers have equivalent physics under these motions (stationary observer S vs. moving observer M)
- Definition of simultaneous spaces for each observer: stationary spaces for S and tipped up simultaneous spaces for M
- No unique concept of simultaneity in Minkowskian geometry but each uniformly moving observer carries their own idea of what simultaneous means.

**Minkowski Spacetime and Relativity Principle (Continued)**
- Significant differences in time ordering for events at great distances even with slow relative velocities (example: people walking past each other)
- The event that seems simultaneous to one observer may not be so for another, leading to di erent perceptions of reality depending on their motion.

#### Equivalence Principle and Gravity Distortion

**Einstein's General Relativity: Galileo's Insight and Space-Time Curvature**

**Galileo's Insight**
- Galileo's great insight that all bodies fall equally fast in a gravitational field
- This was an insight, not a direct observation (due to air resistance)
- The idea of space-time curvature is seemingly different from Newton's scheme where particles accelerate under ordinary gravitational forces

**Implications of Galileo's Insight**
- Newtons theory governs the acceleration of a body under gravity:
  - Gravitational force (proportional to mass)
  - Acceleration (inversely proportional to mass)
- The mass that occurs in Newtons gravitational force law is the same as the mass in Newtons second law
- Galileo's insight ensures that a body's acceleration under gravity is independent of its mass
- This insight would not apply to electric forces, which depend on electric charge and do not follow the same principle as mass

**Galileo's Experiment: Falling Objects**
- Galileo dropping two rocks (and a video camera) from the Leaning Tower of Pisa
- The video camera would show a rock "hovering in space," seemingly unaffected by gravity, due to all objects falling at the same speed under gravity

**Space Travel and Free Fall**
- In space, falling means following an appropriate orbit under gravity
- An astronaut on a space walk views their vehicle as hovering, apparently unaffected by the gravitational force of the Earth
- The eects of gravity can be cancelled by free fall, as the eects of a gravitational field are equivalent to those of acceleration
- Even in a train or aeroplane, sensations may not coincide with visual evidence regarding the strength and direction of gravity

**Principle of Equivalence**
- The local eects of gravity are equivalent to those of an accelerating reference frame
- Allowing for more precise measurements could allow one to distinguish a true gravitational field from pure acceleration

**Non-Uniformity of the Newtonian Gravitational Field**
- Particles nearer to the Earth's surface accelerate downwards faster, distorting the spherical shape of an initially stationary arrangement into an ellipsoid.

#### Gravitational Tidal Effects in Spacetime Curvature

**Gravity: Tidal Effect and General Relativity**

**Tidal Effect of Gravity:**
- Distortion in gravitational field (non-uniformity)
- Cannot be eliminated by free fall
- Measured as inverse cube of distance from center of attraction, not inverse square

**Newton's Inverse Square Law and Tidal Effect:**
- Volume of distorted sphere equals original sphere's volume in vacuum
- Sphere surrounds matter with mass M results in additional inward acceleration
- Proportional to M: force is proportional to attracting body's mass

**Space-Time Picture of Gravity:**
- Worldlines of freely falling particles called geodesics
- Geodesics on a surface are shortest routes, similar to strings stretched over curved surface
- Positive curvature: particles move towards each other; negative curvature: they move away from each other
- Space-time possesses curvature, with both positive and negative effects involved for different displacements

**Newtonian Theory vs General Relativity:**
- Reformulation of Newtonian theory without requiring new physics (yet)
- Combining this picture with Minkowski's description of special relativity results in Einstein's general relativity.

#### Gravitational Tidal Forces in General Relativity

**Curved Spacetime in General Relativity:**

**Locally Flat Spacetime:**
- In the presence of gravity, spacetime is locally like Minkowski's geometry but allows some curviness on a larger scale.
- Any point in space-time is vertex of a light cone, similar to Minkowski space.
- Material particles have curves inside light cones; photons have world lines along them.
- Concept of Minkowski distance for measuring time along world lines exists.

**Geometry of Space-Time:**
- Geodesics in space-time are curves which locally maximize the distance (time) along the world line.
- World lines of particles in free motion under gravity are geodesics according to this rule.
- Rays of light in empty space are also geodesics, but with zero length.

**Newtonian Gravity vs General Relativity:**
- In Newtonian theory, volume change of a sphere surrounded by vacuum does not occur.
- When matter is surrounded, there's a volume reduction proportional to the mass M and pressure in the material.

**Riemann Curvature Tensor:**
- Schematically written as RIEMANN.
- Describes curvature of four-dimensional spacetime.
- Can be split into Weyl tensor (WEYL) and Ricci tensor (RICCI).

**Weyl and Ricci Tensors:**
- Weyl tensor measures tidal distortion of a sphere of freely falling particles.
- Ricci tensor measures initial change in volume.

**Equations of General Relativity:**
- Schematically written as RICCI = ENERGY.
- Equates mass density (or energy density) to the Ricci tensor for consistency with Einsteins equations.

**Tidal Effects:**
- Tidal effect experienced in empty space is entirely due to WEYL.
- Weyl tensor measures gravitational field, analogous to electromagnetic eld in Maxwell's theory.

#### Relativistic Causality Constraints and Implications of Superluminary Signals

**Relativistic Causality and Determinism**

**Principle of Relativity**:
- In Einstein's theory of relativity, material bodies cannot travel faster than light
- World-lines of photons lie along the light cones, and for no particle is it permitted to have a world-line outside the cones

**Implications of Superluminal Signals**:
- If superluminal signals were possible, an observer W could receive a message from a future event A before emitting a signal at event B
- This would lead to contradictions and violations of free will and causality
- Even if the observers are mechanical devices, the same essential contradiction is still obtained

**Conclusion**:
- The rules of special relativity hold locally in general relativity, implying that all signals must be constrained by the light cones.

#### Computability in Classical Physics Determinism and Chaos

**Determinism and Computability in Classical Physics**
- In Newtonian (or Hamiltonian) theory, determinism means initial data at one time completely determine behavior at all other times.
- In relativity theory, there is no global concept of time to specify initial data for determinism.
  * Special relativity: Use a flexible attitude, like a bounded region on a simultaneous space.
  * General relativity: Use the more general notion of a spacelike surface instead.
- Determinism in special relativity: Initial data on a bounded region of a simultaneous space xes behavior in whole space-time.
- Determinism in general relativity is more complicated due to the need to consider geometry and light cone causality structure.
  * Einstein equations give locally deterministic behavior for gravitational field assuming matter elds behave deterministically.
  * Complications include determining which parts of spacelike surface are needed for future event.
- Lack of determinism in extreme situations may lead to global indeterminacy and loss of determinism.
- Computability issues may be as important as determinism when considering free will and mental phenomena.
- Classical theories like special and general relativity do not seem to have significant non-computable elements, apart from the type encountered with Pour-El and Richards for the wave equation which does not occur for smoothly varying data.

#### Mass Matter and Reality Quantifying Substance in Classical Physics

**Classical Physics and Reality**
* Spacetime: primary role as arena for physical activity
* Physical objects: particles and fields
+ Particles: little known about their nature, have mass and charge
+ Fields: specifically defined (e.g., electromagnetic, gravitational)
+ Test particles: respond to elds without influencing them (point particles)
+ Source particles: interact with elds (spread-out sources for Maxwell's equations and Einstein's equations)
+ Space-time has a variable structure describing gravity
* Mass: measure of total substance, conserved but interchangeable with energy due to E = mc
* Energy and mass are interconnected in quantum theory
* Classical physics learnings: great advancements but not final viewpoint.

**Mass, Matter, and Reality (Continued)**
* Mass: measure of quantity of matter in a system
* Einstein's formula E = mc: mass and energy are interchangeable
* Distinction between rest mass and mass-energy of motion
* Conserved mass but dependent on observer's viewpoint.

**Mass, Matter, and Reality (Further Insights)**
* Classical physics presents a picture of physical reality with spacetime, objects, particles, and fields
* Mass as the measure of total substance, conserved but interchangeable with energy due to E = mc
* Viewpoint change: mass is an entire object called the energy-momentum four-vector.

#### Gravitational Energy and Mass in General Relativity Non-Locality and Empty Space Paradox

**Mass and Energy Conservation**
- Arrow representing energy-momentum, with tip (height) determining mass or energy divided by speed of light squared
- Massive objects decay into massless particles: energy-momentum four-vector is conserved using vector addition law
- Rest-mass not additive for individual objects; entire arrow represents total mass/matter

**Mass vs. Energy**
- Maxwell's electromagnetic field carries energy and mass (according to E=mc^2)
- Gravitational waves carry energy but non-local, cannot be measured by standard tensor ENERGY or WEYL/RICCI
- Energy and mass of gravitational eld are difficult to pinpoint and may exist in "empty" regions

**Classical Theories and Reality**
- Established departures from Newtonian picture linked to behavior of light: electromagnetic fields, special relativity, general relativity, wave-particle duality, quantum electrodynamics.
- Thermodynamics not considered a superb theory by author; may be reluctant to classify it as a physical theory due to applying to averages and being derived from other theories.

#### Quantum Field Theory Challenges and Solutions in Classification

**Theory Classification**:
- The author is using a toy model to explore physical theories
- Places theories in different categories: TENTATIVE, USEFUL, SUPERB
- Discusses relationship between thermodynamics and big bang theory as potentially belonging to the SUPERB category
- Mention of Galileo's use of water clocks for observations
- Newtons views on physical world were less dogmatic than attached label of Newtonian mechanics

**Twistor Theory**:
- An elaborate collection of ideas and procedures associated with the author
- Not a separate theory but a mathematical transcription of earlier established physical theories
- Placed in TENTATIVE category as different theory of physical world

**Hamiltonian Mechanics**:
- Evolution of toy model can be computed similarly to Newtonian systems
- Discusses calculational procedures and significance of Euler-Lagrange equations
- Newtons third law important for understanding dynamical behavior of large bodies

**Miraculous Facts for Science Development**:
- Inverse square law crucial for comprehension of Kepler's laws
- Maxwell's equations presented in specific units, factors of c distributed differently with other choices
- Charged particles can act as clocks due to oscillation frequency proportional to mass
- Quantum particles behave like clocks on their own, accurate modern clocks based on this fact.

#### Einsteins General Relativity and Spacetime Geometry

**Simultaneity and Relativity**
- Events judged as simultaneous according to Einstein's definition using light signals: M's perspective (Rindler, 1982)

**Reformulation of Newtonian Theory**
- Cartan's mathematical description of the reformulated theory (1923)
- Named after Bernhard Riemann, Gauss, Lorentzian manifolds or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds

**Zero Length and Maximum Value of Length**
- Zero length geodesic: no other particle world lines connecting any pair of its points (locally)
- In a vacuous sense, it represents the maximum value of length

**Distortion Effects and Volume Change**
- Not clear cut division into distortion effects and volume change (Ricci tensor can give tidal distortion; Penrose and Rindler, 1986, Chapter 7)

**Equations: Lorentzian Manifolds**
- Full Bianchi identities with Einstein's equations substituted into them
- Correct form of the actual equations found by Hilbert in November 1915

**Issues and Limitations**
- Lacking rigorous theorems concerning these issues
- Unsatisfying answer on calculability: infinity (present theory)

**Miscellaneous**
- Einstein's physical ideas solely due to him, but Hilbert found the correct form of equations in November 1915.
- The term "hypersurface" is more appropriate than surface for a three-dimensional object.

#### Quantum Mechanics Resolving Classical Theorys Dilemmas

**Classical vs. Quantum Theory**

**Reasons for questioning Classical Theory**:
- Experimental evidence: not in agreement with classical physics predictions
- Inconsistencies between particles and fields
- Stability issues: energy gets transferred from particles to elds, leaving no degrees of freedom for the particles

**Problems with Classical Theory**:
- Coexistence of particles and elds is inconsistent
- Orbiting electrons emit radiation in discreet bursts instead of continuously as predicted by classical theory
- Black-body radiation does not follow Rayleigh-Jeans' predictions

**Beginnings of Quantum Theory**:
- Max Planck proposed that electromagnetic oscillations occur only in quanta, with energy E = hv
- This allowed for agreement with observed radiation law (Planck radiation law)
- Einstein proposed that the electromagnetic field can exist only in discrete units
- Light can exhibit particle and wave properties at the same time

#### Quantum Interference Light as Wave and Particle

**The Two-Slit Experiment**

**Background:**
- Archetypical quantum mechanical experiment
- Manifestation of wave and particle behavior in light or photons
- Light behaves as particles (all-or-nothing phenomenon) and waves (interference pattern)

**Particle Behavior:**
- Energy is received in discrete units related to frequency through Planck's formula: E = hv
- Light arrives at screen with whole numbers of photons
- Light reception is uniform when intensity is high
- Photons appear to be detected randomly, with different probabilities for different angles of deflection

**Wave Behavior:**
- Spreading out by the phenomenon called diffraction (wave propagation)
- Smooth appearance of illumination is a statistical effect due to large number of photons involved

**Problem for Particle Picture:**
- Opening the second slit: Intensity pattern is completely different from single slit, with points of zero intensity where photon could not reach before despite having an alternative route.

#### Quantum Interference Single Particles Acting as Waves

**Interference Patterns and Wave-Particle Duality**

**Pattern of Intensity at the Screen**:
- When one slit is open, the pattern of intensity is a distribution of discrete tiny spots (Fig. 6.4)
- When both slits are open, the pattern becomes a wavy distribution of discrete spots (Fig. 6.5)

**Photon's Perspective**:
- The second slit is some 300 photon-sizes away from the first (each slit being about a couple of wavelengths wide)
- Yet, the photon seems to know whether or not the other slit is open when passing through the first slit

**Destructive Interference**:
- Cancellation or enhancement phenomenon occurs when light passes through the slits
- This is similar to how waves can cancel each other out in ordinary situations (Fig. 6.7)
- The bright places on the screen occur when the distances to the two slits differ by an integer number of wavelengths
- Dark places occur when the differences are exactly midway between these values

**Classical vs. Quantum Waves**:
- In classical waves, a disturbance can pass through both slits at once
- However, each individual photon behaves like a wave entirely on its own and interferes with itself (Fig. 6.8)
- Even though one route is open alone, the particle appears to be unable to travel through both when they are open together

**Complex Number Combinations**:
- Quantum mechanics insists that alternatives can combine in complex number ways, such as: **A + iB**, where **i** = 1 (Chapter 3)
- These combinations force themselves on physicists through surprising experimental results

#### Quantum Superposition and Probability Amplitudes

**Quantum vs Classical Level**

**Two Different Levels of Physical Description:**
- Quantum level: molecules, atoms, subatomic particles
- Classical level: macroscopic objects like cricket balls and elephants
- Distinction not based on size but tiny energy differences

**Probability Amplitudes (W & Z) at the Quantum Level:**
- Complex numbers instead of probabilities or ratios
- Behave similarly to probabilities, referred to as amplitude or simply amplitudes
- Normalized when sum equals 1 for actual probabilities: p + q = 1

**Interpretation of Probability Amplitudes (W & Z)**
- Not actual probabilities but quantum level analogues
- Pretend they are probabilities or ratios of probabilities for now

**Classical Probability:**
- Describes uncertain situation with two alternatives, A and B
- Probability of each alternative: p (for A) and q (for B)
- Sum of probabilities must be 1 if there are no other alternatives: p + q = 1
- Ratio of probabilities for actual occurrences: P(s,p) = P(s,t)  P(t,p) or P(s,b)  P(b,p) when only one hole is open
- Total probability when both holes are open: P(s,p) = P(s,t)  P(t,p) + P(s,b)  P(b,p)

**Quantum Level Rules:**
- Same as classical probabilities but with amplitudes (A(s,t), A(t,p), etc.) instead of probabilities.

**Interpreting Amplitudes:**
- Unclear until we know how to interpret them at the classical level.
- Need an actual probability for a click or observable event in order to make sense of the quantum amplitudes.

#### Quantum Amplitude Squared Modulus and Probability Transition

**Passing from Quantum to Classical Level**
- Rule: Squared modulus of quantum complex amplitude = classical probability
- Modulus |z| of a complex number is distance from origin (0) in Argand plane
- Squared modulus |z| is square of this number
- Point z in Argand plane must lie within unit circle for proper normalization as probability amplitude
- Combination of alternatives w and z: require their squared moduli to sum to unity for normalization
- Unnormalized amplitudes: w/(|w| + |z|) and z/(|w| + |z|)
- Probability amplitude is not like a probability but more like a complex square root of a probability

**Multiplication and Addition of Complex Numbers**
- Multiplication poses no problem in passing from quantum to classical rules due to: |zw| = |z| ||w|
- Correction term 2|w||z|cos for sum of two complex amplitudes' squared modulus
- Cosine of angle between points z and w in Argand plane () provides quantum interference between alternatives
  - Reinforces: cos = 0, total probability greater than sum of individual probabilities
  - Destructive: cos = 180, total probability less than sum of individual probabilities
  - Intermediate: cos = 90, total probability between sum of individual probabilities
- Large or complicated systems have correction terms average out to classical probability rules.

**Two-Slit Experiment**
- Amplitude for particle reaching p is a sum of w (A(s,t) A(t,p)) and z (A(s,b) A(b,p))
- Brightest points on screen: w = |z|, cos = 1, |w + z| = 4|w| = 4x probability and intensity
- Darkest points on screen: w = z, cos = 1, |w + z| = 0, destructive interference
- Intermediate points: w = iz or z = iw, cos = 0, |w + z| = 2|w| twice the intensity if a large number of photons.

**Important Note**: The squared modulus of an amplitude cannot be interpreted as the probability that the particle passed through a specific slit to reach p.

#### Visualizing Quantum State and Momentum in One-Dimensional Space

**Understanding Quantum Theory: Interference and Wavefunctions**

**The Problem with Detecting Photons:**
- Detection at specific time obliterates interference pattern
- At quantum level, individual routes have only amplitudes, not probabilities

**Quantum State of a Particle:**
- Classically determined by position and velocity
- Quantum mechanically: all positions are alternatives
- Combined with complex-number weightings (amplitudes)
- Collection of complex weightings is the quantum state

**Picturing the Complex Function:**
- Difficult to imagine in three-dimensional space
- Simplify by considering one-dimensional particle on x-axis
- Use Argand plane for complex numbers: y (real axis), z (imaginary axis)
- Plot wavefunction (psi-function) as a point in Argand plane at each position along x-axis
- The resulting curve is the -curve of the particle
- Probability of finding particle at a point is obtained by squaring modulus of amplitude

**Understanding Momentum Amplitudes:**
- Classically, need velocity (or momentum) to determine future behavior
- Quantum mechanically: wavefunction contains various momentum amplitudes
- Apply harmonic analysis to function for determination of these amplitudes
- Each pure tone corresponds to a different possible momentum value
- Size of each pure-tone contribution provides the amplitude for that momentum value.

#### Momentum and Wave-Particle Duality in Quantum Mechanics

**The Uncertainty Principle**
- Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: can't measure both position and momentum precisely at the same time
- This is due to the wave nature of particles, as described by a wavefunction ()
- The most wavelike waves are momentum states
- In the two-slit experiment, photon wavefunctions spread out from source to screen:
  - Each photon wavefunction is composed of momentum states in different directions
  - These wave functions interfere with each other, causing bright or dark spots on the screen depending on the lengths of lines between slits and target point (p)
- When lengths di er by an integer number of wavelengths: amplitudes add up, resulting in a bright spot
- When lengths di er by an integer number plus half a wavelength: amplitudes cancel out, resulting in a dark spot
- In all other cases: intermediate intensity due to some angle between displacements

**Momentum States and Wavefunctions**
- Momentum states correspond to corkscrews in position space (Argand planes)
  - Tightly wound = high momentum, energy, short wavelength, high frequency
  - Loosely wound = low momentum, energy, long wavelength, low frequency
  - Limiting case: no wind, straight line = zero momentum
- Fourier transforms of position wavefunction (x) and momentum wavefunction (p) are symmetrical
  - Position states correspond to delta functions in momentum space
  - Momentum states give delta functions in position space
- Useful for different types of measurements:
  - Position space: measures particle position, uses position wavefunction (x)
  - Momentum space: measures particle momentum, uses momentum wavefunction (p)

#### Quantum Wave Packet Evolution and Measurement Procedures

**Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**
- Classical physics: can accurately measure both position and momentum of a particle at the same time
- Heisenberg discovered an absolute limit on the product of accuracies (x and p) for measuring a particle: x * p
- The more precisely one measures position, the less precisely one can measure momentum, and vice versa
- Example: if position measured to nanometer level, momentum becomes uncertain enough to be located 100 km away within a second
- Three interpretations of uncertainty principle:
  1. Measurement process is clumsy, leading to random kicks in particle's motion
  2. Particle has inherent randomness and unpredictability on quantum level
  3. Concepts of classical position and momentum are not applicable to quantum particles
- Description of wavefunction:
  - Momentum state: corkscrew curve, equal squared moduli for all positions, completely uncertain position
  - Position state: delta function, precisely located at one point, completely uncertain momentum
  - Intermediate case: small region of appreciable distance from axis in both position and momentum space
- Schrdinger's equation describes time development of wave packet as a deterministic process (U)
- When measuring quantum eects at the classical level, we adopt a different procedure (R) to form squared moduli of quantum amplitudes to obtain probabilities. This introduces uncertainties and probabilities into quantum theory.

#### Quantum Spread and Particle Cohesion Two-Peaked Wavefunctions

**Understanding Quantum Theory: Wavefunctions and Particles in Two Places at Once**

**Background:**
- Non-determinism in quantum theory comes from R (probabilistic rule) not U (deterministic Schrdinger equation)
- Wavefunction describes objective reality of individual particle, spread out over space

**Behavior of Momentum State:**
- Stays the same until interaction or measurement
- Predictable and clear-cut as in classical theory
- Probability comes from R when measuring position

**Schrdinger Equation:**
- Determines particle's behavior precisely, no indeterminacy or probabilistic rule
- Evolution of wavefunction (x) determined by this equation

**Particle in Two Places at Once:**
- Spread-out view necessary for motion determination
- Acceptance of reality: particle can be spread out over large regions until next measurement
- Two-peaked state after passing through a pair of slits
  * Sum of wavefunctions t and b, peaked at top and bottom slits respectively
  * Particle in both places at once if accepting the reality of its state as represented by the wavefunction
  * Standard objection: measurement reveals only one place, but various measurements can distinguish two-peaked states from others.

#### Quantum Superposition and Interference in Photons

**Photon Wavefunction and Double-Peaked Distributions**

**Three Different Ways of Observing a Photon's Distribution:**
- Figure 6.16: Three different ways a photon wavefunction can be doubly peaked (see the -curves in each case).
- Distinguishable through various measurements.
- All possibilities are actual ways for the photon to exist.

**Two-Slit Experiment vs Half-Silvered Mirror:**
- Two-slit experiment: photons pass through both slits at once, creating interference effects.
- Wavefunction splits into two parts with different peak locations (closer together).
- Separation between peaks increases over time without limit.

**Experimental Set-up with Half-Silvered Mirror:**
- Re ects half of the light and transmits the other half through mirror.
- Wavefunction splits into two separate parts, each describing a different location.
- Can be much more widely separated than in two-slit experiment.
- Photon may travel over vast distances while being in both places at once.

**Interference Effects:**
- Two parts of the beam can interfere with each other upon meeting again, leading to unexpected results.
- Cannot be explained by probability weighting for two alternatives.

**Experiments and Results:**
- Experimental set-ups have been carried out with various path lengths (including long distances).
- Results agree with quantum mechanical predictions.

**Implications of Photon's State Between Half-Silvered Mirrors:**
- Niels Bohrs view on the unreality of a photon's state between measurements is too pessimistic.
- Quantum mechanics provides a wave function to describe reality, and it can be doubly peaked in certain cases.
- Distinction between different states (t+b vs t-b) determines whether or not a photon reaches specific detectors.

**Superposition of States:**
- Linear superposition allows us to compose various quantum states by adding them using complex number weightings.
- This feature is essential for understanding the reality of particles in multiple places at once.

#### Quantum State Vectors in Hilbert Space

**Quantum Linear Superposition and Hilbert Space**

**Quantum Linear Superposition**:
- Any two states, regardless of how different they are, can coexist in a complex linear superposition
- A physical object, made up of individual particles, could exist in such superpositions of spatially widely separated states, being in two places at once
- The formalism of quantum mechanics does not distinguish between single particles and complicated systems of many particles in this respect

**Question of Macroscopic Objects**:
- Why don't we experience macroscopic objects (e.g., cricket balls, people) having two completely different locations at once?
- The explanation is that the system is at the classical level until an observation or measurement is made
- This "begs the controversial question" of why the quantum rules can be changed from U to R in this manner

**Hilbert Space**:
- In quantum theory, a Hilbert space represents the quantum state of an entire system
- A single point in Hilbert space represents the quantum state of a system
- The mathematical structure of a Hilbert space is a **complex vector space**, allowing addition and weighted sums of its elements
- Elements of the Hilbert space are called **state vectors** and are denoted by symbols in angled brackets (e.g., |x)
- Addition of two state vectors is written as | + |X, with weightings z and w
- Multiplication of a single state by a complex number is equivalent to multiplying the length by the number while keeping the direction unchanged
- Each dimension in a Hilbert space corresponds to an independent physical state of a quantum system

#### Orthogonal Complementation and Projections in Hilbert Space

**Concepts in Quantum Mechanics: Hilbert Space**
- Hilbert space: mathematical structure used to describe quantum systems
- Two-dimensional Hilbert space: elegant picture for location of a single particle with position and momentum states represented as axes
- Infinite-dimensional Hilbert space: arises when considering multiple dimensions or aspects of a system (e.g., position, momentum)
  - Each state corresponds to an independent direction in the Hilbert space
- Importance of orthogonality between rays (states) for quantum mechanics
  - Orthogonal rays: independent of one another
- Measurements: selection of orthogonal basis vectors, representing a complete measurement as a set of orthogonal basis states
  - After measurement, system jumps to selected axis based on probability amplitudes and their squared moduli.
- Complete measurement: idealized measurement requiring infinite precision in locating or measuring properties (e.g., position) anywhere in the universe
- Yes/no measurements: most fundamental type of measurement, can be used to narrow down other properties.

#### Quantum Spin Intrinsic Rotation of Particles

**Quantum Mechanics: State Reduction upon Measurement**
- **State vector reduction**: A state jumps from one subspace Y or N upon measurement based on its projection into these orthogonal complements
- The probability of jumping to Y is proportional to the ratio of the squared length reduction in the projection
- Normalization ensures probabilities sum up to unity (Pythagorean theorem)
- Spin: A measure of particle rotation, conserved like energy and momentum
  - Amount of spin is always the same for a particular type of particle
  - Direction can vary in odd way for fermions

**Spin: Fermions vs Bosons**
- Fermions: Particles with odd-numbered spin (/2, 3/2, 5/2) that rotate differently under complete rotation
- Bosons: Particles with even-numbered spin (0, 1, 2, etc.) whose state-vector returns to itself upon complete rotation
- Electrons as an example of a spin-half particle with two-dimensional state space for up and down spins.

#### Geometrical Representation of Quantum States on Riemann Sphere

**The Geometrical Relation Between Spin Direction and Complex Numbers**
- The ratio of z to w, denoted as q, is significant instead of the absolute complex numbers themselves
- When q  0, it can be represented on the Argand plane, similar to Chapter 3's discussion
- Stereographic projection maps the Argand plane onto a sphere (Riemann sphere)
- The direction of spin given by | = w| + z| is provided by the point q on the Riemann sphere
- Points on the sphere correspond to possible complex ratios for an electron's spin states

**Calculating Probabilities with Angle Between Directions**
- Measuring spin in a particular direction (a) results in either YES or NO answer
- Probability of YES for second measurement: (1 + cos), where  is the angle between directions a and b
- Probability of NO for second measurement: (1 - cos)
- If measurements are at right angles, probability is 50% each way; acute angle makes YES more likely, obtuse angle makes NO more likely.

**Objectivity and Measurability in Quantum States**
- Despite probabilities for outcomes, there's an objective aspect to quantum states represented by state vectors or wave functions
- Some argue that state vectors describe a single system or provide probability information about an ensemble of similarly prepared systems.

#### Quantum State Objectivity and Impossibility of Copying

**Quantum Mechanics and Physical Reality**
- Some doubt about physical reality of state vectors in quantum mechanics due to limited measurability
- State vector is not measurable, but seems to be an objective property of the system
- Objectivity vs. measurability:
  - Spin state of single particle has a well-defined direction before measurement
  - In some cases, the spin state cannot be considered on its own as it's entangled with other particles
- Copying quantum states:
  - Impossible to copy a state while leaving original intact
  - Can be copied if the original is destroyed
- Photon spin and polarization:
  - Photons possess spin but cannot have a fixed point due to traveling at light speed
  - Polarization is the phenomenon that determines how much light passes through a polarizing filter

#### Geometric Representation of Spin States in Quantum Physics

**Electromagnetic Waves Polarization**

**Plane-Polarized Electromagnetic Wave:**
- Consists of electromagnetic waves oscillating in a single plane
- Two polaroids filter waves based on polarization
  * First polaroid: measures and allows through if polarized appropriately
  * Second polaroid: asks same question but for another direction
- Probability of passing through second polaroid given first one is cos angle between directions

**Riemann Sphere:**
- Used to describe full complex number array of polarization states
- Includes circular and elliptical polarization
- Represents possible ways a photon can be polarized as points on the sphere

**Objects with Large Spin:**
- More complicated space of physically distinguishable states than Riemann sphere for systems greater than two basis states
- For spin n/2 particles:
  * Every state uniquely characterized by an unordered set of n directions outwards from center (n points on Riemann sphere)
  * Directions correspond to measurements and outcomes of spin values in those directions.

**Remarks:**
- Massive particles or atoms have larger spin than half, resulting in more complex quantum systems with n + 1 possible outcomes
- The quantum descriptions do not go over to classical Newtonian ones as previously believed for large and complicated systems.

#### Quantum Many-Particle States Non-Product Superpositions

**Quantum Mechanics and Many-Particle Systems**

**Spin States**:
- Spin states of large angular momentum correspond to many points across the Riemann sphere
- These spin states are a collection of individual spin states pointing in arbitrary directions

**Classical Correspondence**:
- Most large-spin quantum states do not resemble classical ones
- However, they are linear combinations of (orthogonal) states that do resemble classical states
- Measurements can cause the system to "jump" to one of these classical-like states

**Many-Particle Systems**:
- Quantum descriptions of many-particle systems are more complicated than single-particle states
- Require specifying possible locations of all particles separately, leading to a vast space of possible states
- The quantum state is a function of multiple positions, not just individual functions as in classical theory

**Example**:
- For 10 possible positions, the state of a single particle requires 10 complex numbers
- For two particles, it requires 100 complex numbers (one for each pair of positions)
- The general two-particle state is a linear superposition, not a simple product of individual states

#### Identical Particles Fermions and Bosons in Quantum Mechanics

**Quantum Mechanics and Distinction Between Meanings of 'And' and 'Plus'**
- Clear distinction must be maintained between meanings of words 'and' and 'plus' in quantum mechanics due to misuse of 'plus' like in insurance brochures
- For three particles, general state requires 1,000 complex numbers for specification (as compared to ten alternative positions)
- Rules are different for identical particles versus distinguishable ones: Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions, allowing no two of the same type to be in the same state

**Fermion and Boson States**
- Fermions (electrons, protons, neutrons): particles must have distinct states under interchange, leading to different number of basis states
  - Two fermions: 45 complex numbers needed for specification
  - Three fermions: 120 complex numbers required
  - Pair of identical bosons: 55 complex numbers needed; three bosons: 220 complex numbers, etc.
- More realistic description involves continuum of position states but essential ideas remain the same
- Complication with spin: for a spin-half particle (fermion), two possible states per position (labeled by 'spin up' and 'spin down') leading to 20 basic states in simplified situation.

**Identity of Particles According to Modern Theory:**
- No reference to individual electrons or photons as they cannot be specified uniquely due to fermion's Pauli exclusion principle. Instead, we can refer to pairs or conglomerate of particles.
- Approximation allowed for individual electrons, protons, and photons based on total picture of all particles in a system.

#### Paradox of EPR and Non-locality in Quantum Mechanics

**Einstein's Paradox and Quantum Theory**

**Introduction:**
- Einstein's contribution to quantum theory: photon concept, wave-particle duality, bosons
- Rejection of probabilistic aspect and objective reality in quantum description
- Argument against subjectivity and need for an objective physical world

**Hidden Variables and Non-Locality**
- Hidden variables theory proposed by Einstein followers like Bohm
- Objective reality but no direct access to hidden parameters
- Successful example: de Broglie-Bohm model
- Problem of non-locality and difficulties with relativity remain unresolved

**Experiment:**
- Two subsystems A and B, e.g., particles
- General combined state is a superposition (plus) of products instead of product (and)
- Measuring A causes state of B to jump: |  ||, NO  ||
- No need for localization between A and B

**Objections:**
- Sudden change in second ball's uncertain state unrealistic
- Instantaneous non-local influence from one particle to another problematic.

**Implications:**
- Physical objectivity can be achieved without determinism but with some uncertainty or indeterminacy
- Standard quantum theory provides a reality that usually evolves deterministically, but occasionally jumps due to measurements.

#### Quantum Entanglement Instantaneous Spin State Correlation

**Non-Local Probabilities in Quantum Theory vs Classical Viewpoint**

**Experiment Scenario**:
- Particle A decays into electron E and positron P
- Electron's spin determines posistron's spin, even when separated
- Measurement choice on one particle seemingly influences the other instantaneously

**Classical Hidden Variable Theory**:
- Each part of system already knows results of experiments beforehand
- Probabilities arise due to experimenter's lack of knowledge

**Quantum Formalism and Bell's Theorem**:
- Quantum formalism leads to conclusion that spins are a linear superposition of all possible directions, not just up/down or right/left
- Measurement outcome determines which component of the superposition is observed
- Repeating experiment with different measurement settings yields results:
  - Same settings on both sides always disagree
  - Randomly chosen settings have equal probability of agreement and disagreement

**Limitations of Classical Model**:
- Cannot explain quantum phenomena where measurement choices instantaneously influence distant particles

**Bell's Theorem**:
- Proves that no local realistic (hidden variable) description can give the correct quantum probabilities.

#### Quantum Non-Locality and Experiments with Photons

**The EPR Paradox and Bell's Theorem**
- **David Mermin's simple version of the EPR paradox**: shows a contradiction between a local realistic view of nature and the results of quantum theory
- The **E-measurer** and **P-measurer** each have three settings for measuring the spins of their respective particles
- Properties (1) and (2) follow directly from the quantum probability rules

**Property (1): Disagreement Between Measures**
- If P-measurer measures spin opposite to E-measurer, property (1) follows immediately

**Property (2): Probability of Agreement vs. Disagreement**
- For measured directions at 120 degrees apart:
  - If E-measurer says "YES", P-direction is at 60 degrees to spin state
  - If E-measurer says "NO", P-direction is at 120 degrees to spin state
- This leads to a probability of agreement = (1 + cos(60)) and disagreement = (1 + cos(120))
- The averaged probability for the three possible P settings, if E gives "YES", is equally likely to agree or disagree

**Local Realistic Models Are Ruled Out**
- If prepared answers were YES, YES, YES / NO, NO, NO, there are 9 cases of disagreement and 0 of agreement
- No set of prepared answers can produce the quantum-mechanical probabilities

**Experiments with Photons: A Problem for Relativity?**
- Similar experiments have been performed using photon polarizations
- Experimental results are fully consistent with quantum theory predictions, but inconsistent with local realistic models
- **Aspect's experiment**: decisions on which direction to measure were made after photons were in full light
  - This "non-local influence" must travel faster than the speed of light, but cannot be used to send messages
- The realistic view of the state-vector applies to this EPR-type experiment:
  - Photon pair acts as a single unit until one is measured, then individual polarizations have definite states

#### Quantum-Mechanical Paradoxes and Field Theory

**Non-Relativistic vs. Relativistic Quantum Mechanics**

**Spacelike-Separated Measurements**:
- Two measurements of polarization are spacelike separated, meaning each lies outside the others light cone (e.g., R and Q in Fig. 5.21)
- The order in which these measurements occur is not physically meaningful, but depends on the observer's motion

**Observer Relativity**:
- If an observer moves rapidly, they can judge the "rst" measurement to have occurred either on the right or left
- This leads to mutually inconsistent pictures of physical reality (Fig. 6.32)

**Schrdinger's Equation vs. Dirac's Equation**:
- **Schrdinger's equation** is a deterministic, linear equation that describes how a quantum state evolves over time
- The **Dirac equation** (for fermions like electrons) was discovered in 1928 and is one of the "Great Field Equations" in physics

**Quantum Electrodynamics**:
- Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the most successful quantum field theory, describing the behavior of electrons and photons
- QED allows for particle-antiparticle annihilation and creation from energy, with a varying number of particles

#### Quantum Superpositions and Schrdingers Cat Paradox

**Quantum Electro-Magnetism (QED)**
* Precise value of magnetic moment of electron derived from Quantum Electro-Magnetism (QED)
* Untidy and inconsistent theory initially gives nonsensical answers, requiring renormalization to remove
* Not all quantum field theories amenable to renormalization and difficult to calculate with even when they are
* Popular approach: path integrals involve quantum superpositions of entire space-time histories
* Deeper understanding needed before confident in physical reality picture
* Partially compatible with special relativity, but does not address relativistic interpretation of quantum jumps or gravity

**Schrdinger's Cat Paradox**
* Thought experiment challenging the superposition principle and measurement problem in quantum mechanics
* Closed system: sealed container with a cat and measuring apparatus
* Quantum event triggers device that either kills or saves the cat
* Inside observer sees R (probabilistic uncertainties), outside observer expects U (linear superposition)
* Problem lies in maintaining linear superposition at large scales, which is not observed for classical objects like cats.

#### Quantum State Interference and the Observers Dilemma Challenges in Quantum Measurement

**Physicist's Perspective on Quantum Superposition and Reality:**

**Subjective View of Physical Reality**:
- Some physicists argue that there is now so much experimental evidence for U (the linear combination of cat being alive and dead) that we have no right to abandon it.
- This could lead to a subjective view of physical reality, where the outside observer sees the cat as in a superposition of life and death, but the inside observer has already collapsed the state.

**Experimental Limitations**:
- Performing an experiment to distinguish U from anything orthogonal is practically impossible for the outside observer.
- Quantum theory doesn't clearly distinguish between measurements that are possible and those that are not.

**Environmental Considerations**:
- The cat itself and its environment involve a vast number of particles, making it difficult to distinguish complex linear combinations from probability mixtures.
- Even if the reality is a complex superposition, how does it transform into one alternative or the other?

**Density Matrices**:
- Some argue that complicated systems should be described by density matrices, but this doesn't fully resolve the issues around quantum measurement.
- Classical probabilities and quantum amplitudes are involved in density matrices.

#### Quantum Superpositions Consciousness and Reality Dilemmas

**Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness: Non-Linearity in Schrdinger's Cat Experiment**

**Chaos Effects and Linear Superpositions:**
- Linear U cannot resolve unwanted linear superpositions
- Chaos eects cannot occur with U alone due to its linearity
- A non-linear element is needed to resolve superpositions

**Wigner's Model for Conscious Entities:**
- Linearity of Schrdinger equation may fail for conscious (or living) entities
- Replaced by a non-linear procedure, resolving alternatives
- Few and far between corners where consciousness exists

**Participatory Universe:**
- Reality is lopsided towards areas with consciousness
- Only in these regions do complex quantum linear superpositions get resolved into alternatives

**Many Worlds Interpretation:**
- R never takes place, entire universe governed by deterministic U
- Schrdinger cat exists in a superposition of life and death
- Consciousness splits for each observer, creating multiple instances
- Universes split at every measurement or macroscopic event

**Summary of Standard Quantum Theory:**
- Applicable to quantum level where small energy differences exist between alternatives
- Describes the world using complex number weighted superpositions called probability amplitudes
- Quantum systems must be described by such a quantum state

**Reviewing Standard Quantum Theory:**
- No clear answer on how to describe the actual world beyond quantum level
- Puzzling issues persist regarding consciousness and measurement
- Further ingredients needed to make many-worlds view work effectively.

#### Quantum Mechanics and the Quest for a More Comprehensive Theory

**Quantum Mechanics and Classical Physics**

**Deterministic Evolution of Quantum States**:
- The quantum state evolves deterministically according to the Schrdinger equation (process U)
- When quantum alternatives become large enough, they are no longer perceptible at the classical level
- Superpositions of complex amplitudes appear as probabilities for the actual physical experience through the process R (reduction of state vector or collapse of wavefunction)

**Non-Determinism in Quantum Theory**:
- The non-deterministic nature of quantum theory only enters at this point, not before U
- This can lead to paradoxical and complicated quantum states for multiple particles, referred to as entanglements or correlations

**Quantum States vs. Classical Physics**:
- Quantum states do not resemble classical physics for macroscopic bodies
- Attempting to apply the linear laws of U to these bodies would violate common sense and relativity
- A more comprehensive, non-linear law may be needed to replace U and R

**Possible Changes in Quantum Theory**:
- The linearity of U may not extend into the macroscopic world
- Some type of hidden variable viewpoint could potentially be acceptable but faces challenges due to non-locality from EPR experiments
- A more radical change, possibly involving a new law, may be needed for quantum theory to merge with classical physics and explain the mind

#### Exploring Quantum Mechanics Probability Amplitudes and Fermion Exclusion Principle

**Quantum Mechanics and Realism**
* Starting point: realistic perspective in philosophy
* Opposition to subjective views of no real world (e.g., quantum mechanics' implications)
* Einstein's unsuccessful attempts for a comprehensive theory beyond classical field theory (1955)

**Background: Balmer's Spectral Lines and Quantum Mechanics**
* Discrete nature of particles revealed by spectral lines of hydrogen (Balmer, 1885)
* Two evolution procedures in quantum mechanics: R reduction of state-vector and U unitary evolution (von Neumann, 1955)

**Mathematical Concepts**
* Hilbert space and vectors
* Scalar product/inner product
* Unitarity, normalization, orthogonality

**Measurement Processes**
* Measurement of a state involves jumping to either | or something orthogonal to | (Dirac notation)
* Operators: || and their eigenvalues determine Yes or No answers
* Stern-Gerlach apparatus for measuring spin (not applicable for electron spin due to technical reasons)

**Fermions vs. Bosons**
* Fermi-Dirac statistics for fermions, Bose-Einstein statistics for bosons
* Developed by Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac in 1926
* Distinguished from classical statistics (Boltzmann)

#### Experimental Indication of Quantum Nonlocality EPR Paradox

**Experiment Results:**
- In 1924, Albert Einstein and Niraj Bose conducted an experiment with two measurement settings for E (up [] and right []) and P (45p to the right [] and 45 down to the right []).
- The probability of agreement between measurements was (1 + cos 135) = 0.146 or approximately 15%.
- If P measurements were not influenced by E settings, there would still be under 15% agreement between them.
- However, this contradicts the expected over 85% probability of agreement based on the angle between settings.
- This contradiction shows that the assumption that choice of measurement cannot influence results is false.
- Mermin (1985) discussed this example, which was earlier addressed by Freedman and Clauser (1972).

**Details of Experiment:**
- Settings: Two for E (up [] and right []) and P (45p to the right [] and 45 down to the right []). Actual settings are [] and [], respectively.
- Probability of agreement without influence: Just under 15% between E and P measurements, or just over 85% if influenced.
- Contradiction: Over 85% expected probability vs. actual under 15%.
- Argument point: Possible non-computability in quantum field theory (cf. Komar 1964).

### 7 Cosmology And The Arrow Of Time

**Cosmology and The Arrow of Time**

**The Flow of Time**:
- Central to our feelings of awareness is the sensation of time's progression
- We seem to be moving ever forward, from a definite past into an uncertain future
- The past is over and unchangeable, while the future seems undetermined with potentialities for reality
- As we perceive time passing, the most immediate part of the future becomes realized and enters the fixed past

**Physics vs Perception**:
- Physics tells a different story, with successful equations being symmetrical in time
- The past and future seem physically on equal footing, contradicting our perception of time's arrow
- Relativity challenges the concept of "now" with observer relativity
- Discrepancies between conscious perception and physical theory suggest a time-asymmetrical ingredient is needed to reconcile the two

#### Time-Symmetry and Entropy Unraveling the Past vs Future Mystery

**Understanding Time-Asymmetries in Physics through Thermodynamics:**

**Second Law of Thermodynamics**
- Important concept involving time-asymmetries
- Inevitable increase of entropy (disorder)

**Glass Falling from Table Example**
1. In real life: glass falls, breaks into pieces, heat is generated from energy lost during fall
2. Time reversibility of laws: water could have flowed upwards and glass assembled itself back on the table
3. Unlikelihood of perfect coordination among atoms for assembly in reverse order
4. Normal parlance: causes precede effects; but be careful not to prejudice past vs future discussion
5. Deterministic equations (classical physics) have no preference for future or past
6. Future determines past equally as past determines future when evolving equations backwards in time
7. Imagining a universe where same symmetric classical equations apply but behavior is reversed: familiar kind of behavior, yet different interpretation of cause and effect.

**Understanding Second Law of Thermodynamics:**
- Inevitable increase of entropy (disorder) in physical systems
- Time asymmetry related to the fact that certain processes occur more frequently in one direction than the other.

**Glass Falling from Table Example Reversed:**
1. Heat energy is required to raise glass back onto table with coordinated motion
2. Such precise coordination is unlikely among atoms post event (unlike pre-event)
3. Energy conservation: heat energy comes from the loss of energy during fall, but reversing this would require absurdly precise atom movements to reassemble the system.
4. Coordinated motion after an event is acceptable and familiar, while coordinated motion before an event is viewed as magic or unlikely.
5. In our normal parlance, we assume cause precedes effect; however, in understanding time asymmetry in physics, this assumption may need to be reconsidered.
6. Deterministic equations have no preference for future or past direction, but the interpretation of cause and eect can differ depending on which direction is considered.
7. In a hypothetical universe where same symmetric classical equations apply but behavior is reversed: familiar kind of behavior but different interpretation of cause and eect (future as cause and past as ect or vice versa).

#### Time Reversal and Entropy A Counterfactual Scenario

**The Coexistence of Perverse and Normal Experiences**
- Imagining a world where water glasses can self-assemble, eggs unscramble themselves, and sugar lumps form in coffee cups and jump into hands
- In such a world, we would attribute the causes to teleological effects rather than random chance coincidences of atomic behavior
- The glass on the table would be the cause, the atoms on the floor the effect, despite occurring earlier in time
- Describing happenings in reverse of our normal conventions would not resolve the issue in this world

**Understanding Our Actual World: Entropy and Special Ordering**
- In our world, causes precede effects; coordinated particle motions occur after large-scale changes
- Introducing the concept of entropy as a measure of manifest disorder
- Low entropy refers to special order or arrangement that is not manifest, such as precise coordination of individual particle motions
- High entropy reflects manifest disorder and randomness in systems, like shattered glass and spilled water
- The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system increases over time or remains constant for a reversible system.

#### Coarse-Graining Phase Space for Entropy Measurement

**Understanding Entropy: Second Law of Thermodynamics**

**Entropy Concept and Irreversible Systems:**
- Entropy is a measure of manifest disorder in a physical system, often associated with irreversibility (practical imprecision)
- All systems are reversible when considering individual particle motions; irreversible refers to uncontrolled motions (heat)
- Debate on subjectivity: different observers may perceive order differently but macroscopic changes dominate entropy calculations.

**Entropy Concept Precision:**
- Utilitarian in precise scientific descriptions due to enormous contribution of random particle motions to entropy change
- Phase space concept introduced for grouping identical physical systems based on manifest properties (coarse-graining)

**Maxwellian Distribution and Thermal Equilibrium:**
- Most phase space corresponds to uniformly distributed gases in thermal equilibrium with characteristic random motion
- Enormous volume of points representing these states occupies almost the entire phase space.

#### Entropy Discrepancies in Phase Space Gas Distribution Model

**Gas Behavior in Thermal Equilibrium vs. Corner of Box**

**Macroscopically Indistinguishable States:**
- All describe gas being tucked up in the same way in corner of box
- Constitute another compartment of phase space
- Volume far tinier than thermal equilibrium states

**Model for Gas in a Box:**
- Distribution of balls among cells represents different positions in box
- Special subset of cells (1/10) represent gas molecule positions corresponding to region in corner

**Probability of All Balls in Special Cells:**
- One ball: 1/10
- Two balls: 1/190, then 1/110 with large number of cells
- Three balls: 1/4060, then 1/1000 with very large number of cells
- Four balls: 1/10000, then 1/100000 with very large number of cells
- m balls: 1/10m

**Special Compartment Volume:**
- For an m-atom gas, volume is 1/10 m of entire phase space volume

**Entropy:**
- Measure of volume of compartment representing state in phase space
- Logarithmic scale to make entropy additive for independent systems
- Entropy difference between thermal equilibrium and corner region: about 1400 JK-1 (14 kJ)

**Second Law in Action:**
- Gas starts in very special situation, then spreads and occupies larger volumes
- Eventually settles into thermal equilibrium.

#### Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Phase Space Dynamics

**Second Law of Thermodynamics in Phase Space**

**Concept:**
- In a gas system, phase space represents the complete state of positions and motions of all particles
- As time progresses, the point representing this information wanders about in phase space
- Entropy increase is an exponential measure of the volume occupied by the point as it enters larger compartments over time

**Explanation:**
1. **Initial state**: Point starts off in a tiny region (low entropy) corresponding to all particles being in one corner of the box
2. **Spreading gas**: As gas spreads, the phase space point moves into larger volumes with each new volume dwarfing previous ones
3. **Thermal equilibrium**: The point eventually loses itself in the largest volume, representing thermal equilibrium (high entropy)
4. **Entropy's role**: Entropy increase provides a logarithmic measure of the volume occupied by the phase space point, which is inexorable and tends to increase over time
5. **Time asymmetry**: The argument deduces that entropy must decrease when moving backwards in time, but this is not consistent with actual behavior (entropy increases)
6. **Alternative scenarios**: If gas was previously in a small volume, more likely alternative scenarios involve removing a partition or heating to create space rather than starting from thermal equilibrium
7. **Correcting the argument**: The most likely way for the system to reach its current state might not be through reaching thermal equilibrium first and then collapsing into the corner; other scenarios could occur where entropy decreases before increasing.

#### Origins of Low Entropy in the Universe The Role of Photosynthesis and Sunlight

**The Second Law of Thermodynamics and Low Entropy States**

**The Original Argument**:
- Attempting to apply the phase-space argument in reverse direction casts doubt on the original argument
- The argument showed that, without other constraints, entropy would increase in both directions from a given low-entropy state
- This is not in contradiction with the second law as the initial entropy was not constrained

**The Puzzle of Low Entropy States**:
- The common presence of absurdly low entropy states in the universe is an "amazing fact" that we take for granted
- For example, ourselves and other objects around us have a low entropy configuration
- The puzzle lies in how this low entropy was created and maintained in the past, where there were constraining factors

**The Origin of Low Entropy**:
- Our own low entropy comes from the food we eat and oxygen we breathe
- Energy is conserved, but we must replace the heat lost as a high-entropy form to maintain internal organization
- Plants play a crucial role in reducing entropy through photosynthesis, which uses sunlight to separate oxygen and carbon
- The sunlight brings energy to earth in a low-entropy form, while re-radiated heat is in a high-entropy infra-red form

#### Entropy and Energy Flow in the Universe Sun-Earth Interactions

**The Earth's Energy and Entropy**
- The earth (and its inhabitants) does not gain energy from the sun, but takes in low entropy energy from the sun and emits it back out as high entropy energy
- The sun provides a source of low entropy through visible light photons that are absorbed by the earth and re-radiated as infra-red photons
- This energy balance is maintained because there are fewer visible light photons reaching the earth than infra-green light photons leaving the earth

**Plants and Entropy**
- Plants take in low entropy energy (fewer visible light photons) and re-radiate it as high entropy energy (more infra-red photons)
- This allows plants to feed on this low entropy source and provide oxygen-carbon separation that is necessary

**The Sun's High Temperature**
- The sun maintains a high temperature due to gravitational contraction from a previously uniform distribution of gas (mainly hydrogen)
- Without gravity, the sun would not exist as a hot spot in the sky
- Gravity holds the sun's material together and provides the necessary temperatures and pressures for thermonuclear reactions to occur

**Fossil Fuels and Entropy**
- Fossil fuels come from prehistoric plant life that got their low entropy from the sun
- The gravitational action in forming the sun out of a diffuse gas is crucial for this process
- An alternative theory suggests oil and natural gas were trapped inside the earth when it formed and synthesized by sunlight before the earth existed

**Nuclear Energy from Uranium-235**
- Nuclear energy in uranium-235 did not come originally from the sun, but from other stars that exploded thousands of millions of years ago
- The material was thrown back into space during the supernova explosion, with a huge gain in entropy due to gravitational contraction
- Gravity was ultimately responsible for the condensation of diffuse gas into a neutron star, which held the uranium-235 nucleus' low entropy store of energy

#### Cosmology and Expansion of the Universe Big Bang Theory and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Models

**Cosmology and The Big Bang**

**The Universe's Appearance**:
- Large scale, uniform appearance
- Expanding universe: galaxies and quasars receding
- Evidence for expansion: black-body background radiation (2.7K)

**The Big Bang Theory**:
- Occurred approximately 10 billion years ago
- Predicted by George Gamow in 1948 based on standard big bang picture
- Observed by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, accidentally

**Expansion of the Universe**:
- Uniform on a large scale, no special location
- Comparison to expanding balloon: all points recede from each other
- Three FRW models for universe expansion: spatially closed (positive curvature), zero/negative curvature (Euclidean)

**Space-Time Description**:
- Euclidean planes for each moment of time, stacked together
- Galaxy world-lines move away from each other into the future direction
- No particular galaxy preferred in the description.

#### Origin of the Universe and the Big Bang Theory

**The Expanding Universe: Positive vs Negative Curvature**

**Positively Closed Universe:**
- Cannot continue to expand forever according to Einstein's general relativity
- Eventually reaches maximum expansion and collapses back in on itself (big crunch)
- Only applies with a zero cosmological constant

**Negatively Curved and Zero-Curved Universes:**
- Do not recollapse as they continue expanding forever
- These models may have spatially infinite universe models or positively curved ones that expand infinitely

**The Primordial Fireball: Origin of the Second Law of Thermodynamics**

**Big Bang Theory**:
- Universe was spewed out during creation, creating space itself
- No pre-existing empty space into which material was ejected
- Material was spread uniformly over the entire universe right from the start

**The Hot Big Bang (Standard Model):**
- Universe moments after creation was in an extremely hot thermal state (primordial fireball)
- Detailed calculations have been performed to understand the initial constituents and their changes during expansion and cooling
- These calculations are based on non-controversial physics theories, though the events before 10^(-42) seconds remain uncertain.

#### Evolution of Stars and Black Holes Formation and Entropy

**The Big Bang and Entropy: Understanding the Second Law**

**Material Composition of the Universe**:
- Mainly protons and electrons
- Hydrogen gas formed at about 108 years after the big bang
- Stars not formed instantaneously, gas expansion and cooling needed for clumping to occur
- Unresolved issue: How galaxies form and initial irregularities required for galaxy formation

**Distribution of Material in the Universe**:
- Stars collected in galaxies
- Galaxies grouped into clusters and superclusters
- Evidence shows early universe was very uniform

**Entropy and the Second Law**:
- Initial entropy of the universe was low, not maximum as required by thermal equilibrium
- Paradox: Big Bang initiated with high temperature (maximum entropy), yet second law demands minimum initial entropy
- One explanation: Actual entropy lags behind permitted maximum due to expansion of the universe
- However, this doesn't hold for a contracting universe model like a "big crunch"
- Reasons for doubting reversal of entropy in collapsing universes: Black holes and violation of second law observed behavior

**Black Holes**:
- Ultimate fate of stars like the sun (red giants)
- Expanding to become red giants, eventually collapse into a black hole
- Theories predict black holes have no entropy or temperature, challenging the second law.

#### Core Collapse and Formation of Compact Stars

**White Dwarfs: Fate of Stars**

**Formation of White Dwarfs:**
- Core of red giant star, extremely dense and small concentration of matter
- Eventually consumes entire red giant, leaving behind an actual white dwarf (about Earth size)
- Sun's fate: red giant for a few thousand million years, then white dwarf for many more millions of years

**Chandrasekhar Limit:**
- Calculation by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1929 and Lev Landau around 1930
- White dwarfs cannot exist if their masses are greater than approximately 1.4 solar masses (M)
- Stars with mass exceeding this limit collapse catastrophically, forming a supernova

**Neutron Stars:**
- Result of core collapse in some stars, above Chandrasekhar limit
- Held apart by neutron degeneracy pressure
- Densities much greater than white dwarfs and atomic nuclei
- Modern value for maximum neutron star mass: about 2.5 M

**Black Holes:**
- Result of core collapse in extremely massive stars (greater than Landau-Oppenheimer-Volkov limit)
- Region of space where gravitational field is so strong that not even light can escape
- Escape velocity exceeding the speed of light, impossible for objects to leave.

#### Space-Time Geometry of Black Holes and White Holes

**Black Holes and White Holes**

**Formation of a Black Hole:**
- Collapse of body maintains spherical symmetry closely
- Light cones indicate limitations on motion
- Critical distance: Schwarzschild radius
  - At this point, light's velocity is barely enough to counteract gravitational pull
- Event horizon formed at the Schwarzschild radius
  - Anything within cannot escape or communicate with outside world

**Observations from Outside:**
- Portion inside event horizon not seen by observer A
- Portion outside eventually visible, but image rapidly becomes too dim

**Experience of Person B (inside black hole):**
- No noticeable change at horizon crossing
- Local physics consistent with known laws
- Entropy increases until final crunch

**Theoretical Concepts:**
- White holes: time reverse of a black hole
  - Probably don't exist in nature, but significant for theory

**Space-Time Singularities:**
- Recall from Chapter 5 (p. 269)
- Light cones indicate limitations on motion
- Critical point where tips become vertical: singularity
  - Extreme gravitational pull
- Not expected to violate second law of thermodynamics inside a black hole.

#### Tidal Forces in Black Holes and Big Bang High and Low Entropy Singularities

**The Tidal Effect of Space-Time Curvature**

**Tidal Distortion**:
- Spherical surface near a large body is stretched in one direction and squashed perpendicularly
- The tidal distortion increases as the gravitating body is approached, varying inversely with the cube of the distance

**Astronaut B's Experience**:
- Felt as a huge tidal effect, too large to survive close approach to a black hole
- For larger black holes, the tidal eect at the horizon is smaller but still enough to make the astronaut uncomfortable
- The tidal eect mounts rapidly towards infinity as the astronaut falls in

**Ultimate Catastrophe**:
- The astronaut's body and molecules are torn apart
- Even subatomic particles are destroyed, leading to a "crunch" that wreaks havoc on all matter and space-time
- This is referred to as a "space-time singularity", the ultimate catastrophe where space-time ends

**Classical Equations of General Relativity**:
- Show that such catastrophic behavior occurs when a black hole is formed
- Challenged earlier hopes that this was an artifact of symmetries in the original model

**Singularity Theorems**:
- Mathematical arguments, known as "singularity theorems", established the inevitability of space-time singularities
- Provide evidence for the creation and destruction of all matter and space-time

**Temporal Symmetry vs. Geometric Differences**:
- Appear to have exact temporal symmetry, but are not when examined in detail
- Key to understanding the origin of the second law of thermodynamics

**Astronaut B's Experiences**:
- Faces tidal forces that mount rapidly towards infinity
- Experiences the "volume-preserving but distorting effects" provided by the space-time curvature tensor "WEYL"
- The remaining part of the space-time curvature tensor, "RICCI", is zero in empty space

**Singularity Behavior**:
- Close to a final singularity, the "distorting tidal eect" provided by "WEYL" goes to infinity, generally
- With a big bang, the situation with the initial singularity is quite different:
  - The distorting tidal eect of "WEYL" is entirely absent
  - The symmetric inward acceleration of "RICCI" dominates near the initial singularity

#### Black Hole Formation and Entropy in Closed Universes

**Reversal of Gravity's Effect on Clumping**
- Gravity causes reversal of clumping due to its universally attractive nature
- As time goes on, clumping becomes more extreme leading to many black holes congealing and their singularities uniting in the final big crunch singularity

**Comparison to Idealized Big Crunch Singularity**
- The final singularity does not resemble the idealized big crunch of the recollapsing FRW model with its constraint WEYL = 0
- As more clumping occurs, there is a tendency for the Weyl tensor to get larger and larger, **WEYL > 0 at any final singularity**

**Entropy in the Universe**
- For an ordinary gas, increasing entropy tends to make distribution more uniform
- For gravitating bodies, high entropy is achieved by gravitational clumping and the highest by collapse into a black hole
- This explains how a recollapsed universe does not need to have a small entropy as observed in the second law of thermodynamics

**How Special Was the Big Bang?**
- Let's try to understand the constraint WEYL = 0 at the big bang
- Imagining phase space: Each point represents a possible way the universe could start, Creator aims for a tiny volume (low entropy) to create our actual universe

**Bekenstein-Hawking Formula for Black Hole Entropy**
- Proportional to surface area of black hole
- For spherically symmetrical black hole, entropy is proportional to square mass
- Greatest entropy achieved when all mass is concentrated in a black hole
- Two black holes gain more entropy when they unite into one
- Large black holes provide stupendous amounts of entropy compared to other situations.

**Hawking's Analysis of Black Holes**
- Associated temperature with a black hole, not all mass-energy can be contained in the maximum entropy state
- Hawking temperature is tiny for reasonable sized black holes and would become significant if mini-black holes or large numbers existed.

#### Quantum Gravity and the Origin of Entropy

**Black Hole Entropy vs. Universe's Entropy**

**Background Radiation Entropy**:
- Previously thought to be the largest contributor to the universe's entropy
- Approximately 10^8 for every baryon (photons per baryon)
- With 10^8 baryons in the universe, total entropy would be 10^88

**Black Hole Entropy**:
- Bekenstein-Hawking formula: Entropy per baryon = 10^20 (natural units) for a solar-mass black hole
- If the universe consisted only of solar-mass black holes, total entropy would be 10^100
- For realistic galaxy composition (10^11 stars and 10^6 solar-mass black hole per galaxy), entropy is ~10^21
- After a long time, most galaxies' masses will be in black holes, leading to total entropy of 10^31

**Creator's Precision**:
- To produce our observed universe, the Creator would have had to aim for an absurdly tiny volume (1/10^10123) of phase space

**Singularities and the Second Law**
- Understanding the origin of the second law requires understanding the structure of space-time singularities
- The "Weyl Curvature Hypothesis" suggests a time-asymmetric constraint at initial singularities that the Creator follows to create our universe

#### Exploring the Directionality and Flow of Time Insights from Relativity and Quantum Mechanics

**Understanding the Directionality and Flow of Time: Theories and Insights from Journey to the Ends of Space and Time**

**Key Points:**
- Several prominent scientists have attempted to construct a theory explaining why time seems to flow in one direction, but with limited success.
- Despite lack of an adequate theory, important lessons can be learned from journey through space and time concepts.
- Theories on entropy play a role in understanding the directionality and flow of time:
  - Entropy is gained through fusion of light nuclei (e.g., hydrogen to helium) in stars, but this is temporary as it requires gravity's concentrating effects.
  - Black-body background radiation contains vastly greater entropy than matter in ordinary stars, which could potentially disintegrate heavier nuclei if concentrated back into material.

**Speculative Return Trip:**
- Our return journey will be more speculative than the outward one but necessary to understand the mind.
- Notes on some concepts discussed during our journey:
  1. Relative vs. Absolute Space and Time: observers' light cones vs. simultaneous spaces make no difference in conclusions.
  2. Controversial evidence for Gold's theory from ultra-deep well drillings in Sweden.
  3. Entropy gain through fusion is temporary, made possible by gravity's concentrating effects.
  4. Uranium production in supernovae unlikely to produce much entropy compared to gravity resources.
  5. Infinite models vs. finite ones; no significant impact on discussion.
  6. Confidence in unchanged parameters governing particle interactions since ancient times.
  7. Pauli's principle and controversy around electrons occupying the same state.
  8. Black hole theory development by Michell, Laplace, Oppenheimer, and Snyder using Newtonian theory with some debatable arguments.
  9. Difficulty of ascertaining exact location of horizon in general non-stationary black holes.
  10. Possible identification of gravitational contribution to entropy as Weyl curvature but no appropriate measure yet found.
  11. Inflationary scenario and its limitations compared to the Weyl curvature hypothesis for explaining universe's uniformity on a large scale.

### 8 In Search Of Quantum Gravity

**Why Quantum Gravity? What is New from Last Chapter?**

**New Insights**:
- We have not gained insights into why we perceive time to flow or why we perceive at all
- More radical ideas are needed

**Weyl Curvature Hypothesis**:
- Physics presentation has been less conventional than usual
- Origin of the second law of thermodynamics can be traced to an enormous geometrical constraint on the big bang origin of the universe
- Deductions from this hypothesis will be less conventional

**Unconventional Viewpoint**:
- General relativity may have effects on the structure of quantum mechanics, rather than the other way around
- The problems within quantum theory are fundamental and cannot be adequately resolved by interpretation alone
- A radical new theory is needed to resolve the incompatibility between U (unitary evolution) and R (probabilistic state-vector reduction) procedures in quantum mechanics
- Even if classical gravity has no direct influence, quantum corrections may still have relevance to mental phenomena

**Conventional View**:
- Quantum effects on general relativity are insignificant at scales relevant to brains
- Problems within quantum theory are best addressed by modifying Einstein's theory of space-time, not the standard structure of quantum mechanics

**Quantum Gravity**:
- True quantum gravity theory will constitute a profound part of our understanding of Nature's universal laws
- However, we are far from such an understanding
- Putative quantum gravity theory would be remote from phenomena governing brain activity

#### Exploring Quantum Gravity Implications Weyl Curvature Hypothesis and Initial Singularities

**The Weyl Curvature Hypothesis and Quantum Gravity**

**Background:**
- Conventional view: quantum gravity will resolve space-time singularities in general relativity
- Surprising fact: quantum gravity's mark on singularities is time-asymmetrical (Weyl tensor = 0 at big bang, not restricted at future singularities)

**Argument for Time-Asymmetric Quantized Theory:**
1. Singularities require explanation from quantum gravity
2. Conventional procedures of quantization may not produce time-asymmetric theory
3. Historically, dynamical equations and boundary conditions have been separated in physics, but this distinction may dissolve in future comprehension of universe's laws
4. Personal viewpoint: we can explore implications of unknown theory (CQG) by accepting it will provide explanation for Weyl Curvature Hypothesis (WCH).

**Implications:**
- Initial singularities have constraints based on CQG laws (WEYL = 0) if they exist, not just for big bang.

#### Time Asymmetry in Quantum State Reduction Probability Jump and Observation

**Weyl Singularities and White Holes**

**Singularities in Black Holes vs. White Holes**:
- Singularities inside black holes satisfy Weyl conditions (Weyl = 0 for big bang singularity)
- For white holes, the singularity is an initial singularity, requiring WEYL = 0 to comply with Weyl conformal gravity
- This rules out the occurrence of white holes in our universe, as it contradicts the WCH requirement for white holes

**Black Hole Explosions and Singularities**:
- The explosion of a black hole that has vanished after Hawking evaporation may not conflict with WCH
- Such an explosion could be effectively instantaneous and symmetrical, allowing for WEYL = 0 hypothesis
- It is likely that the first such explosion will not occur until after the universe has existed for much longer than its current age

**Alternative Perspectives**:
- Some argue that CQG should allow two types of singularity structure, one with and one without WEYL
- However, this does not explain why there are no other initial white hole singularities in the universe
- The anthropic principle cannot account for the required level of specialness in the big bang

**Time Asymmetry in State-Vector Reduction**:
- Quantum theory is time-symmetric in terms of unitary evolution, but not state-vector reduction (R)
- The state-vector reduction procedure is time-asymmetrical as it involves a sudden jump to another state
- This suggests that the R part of quantum mechanics may be inherently time-asymmetric, unlike the U part

#### Quantum Mechanics and Time Reversal A Simple Experiment

**Reversed Quantum Mechanics Description**

**Background:**
- Illustrated in Fig. 8.2
- State-vector taken as | immediately before O instead of after it
- Unitary evolution applied backwards in time to the previous observation

**State-Vector Evolution:**
- Reversed-time description: | represents state immediately past O
- Normal forwards-evolved description: Some other state | just to the future of O (result of observation at O)

**Calculating Probability p:**
- Same value as before, but what it refers to is different
- Probability of finding result (|) at O given result (|) at O vs. probability of result at O given result at O

**Experiment Example:**
1. Lamp L emits photons randomly towards P with 50% chance of reflection or transmission by half-silvered mirror M
2. Reversed time description: When L registers a photon, wavefunction splits into two parts: one reaching photo-cell P and another reaching point A on the wall
3. Probability that photo-cell detects a photon given that source emits one is 50%, but probability that source emitted a photon given that photo-cell detected one is not 50% (time irreversibility)
4. Quantum mechanical calculation: Given L registers, probability of P registering = 1/2 (squared amplitudes for each path)
5. Experimentally observed result: One would obtain a 50% success rate in detecting the photon at both ends of the experiment.

#### Quantum Mechanics Time Reversal Limitations and Hawkings Box Thought Experiment

**Quantum Mechanics and Time Symmetry: The Procedure R**

**Background:**
- Using eccentric reverse-time procedure to obtain answers in quantum mechanics
- Two types of questions: given that L registers, what is the probability that P registers? vs. Given that the photon is ejected from the wall at B, what is the probability that P registers?
- Standard R procedure works for future probabilities but not time-reversed ones
- Discussion on second law of thermodynamics and its role in measurement process

**The Box Experiment:**
- Thought experiment proposed by Stephen Hawking
- Imaginary box with totally reflecting walls, no object or signal can pass through
- Contains large amount of material substance
- Question: what happens to the contents over time?
- According to second law of thermodynamics, entropy should increase and reach maximum value
- When thermal equilibrium is attained, most material collapses into a black hole with some remaining matter and radiation
- Technological difficulties ignored for thought experiment purposes.

#### Evolution of Black Hole Formation and Disappearance in Hawkings Box Phase Space

**Understanding Hawking's Box Equilibrium and Fluctuations**

**Hawking's Box**:
- Contains various states of the system, including those with a black hole (region ) or without a black hole (region )
- Phase space schematic: Figure 8.4

**Thermal Equilibrium States**:
- Major portion of region represents thermal equilibrium with a black hole present
- Smaller major portion represents thermal equilibrium without a black hole

**Hawking Evaporation and Arrows in Phase Space**:
- Classical theory of general relativity: Black holes can only swallow things, not emit them
- Quantum mechanical effects (Hawking radiation): Black holes emit particles through Hawking radiation
- Occasionally, a black hole may lose energy and mass due to Hawking evaporation, causing it to heat up and potentially disappear
- Arrows in phase space represent the system's temporal evolution:
  - Some arrows cross from region to region , representing black hole formation by gravitational collapse
  - Other arrows cross from region to region , representing Hawking radiation emission when a black hole loses energy

**Coarse-Graining and Entropy**:
- Coarse-graining compartments in phase space: Indistinguishable points within each compartment
- Entropy increases as the system moves towards larger, more thermally equilibrated compartments (maximum entropy)
- Occasionally, a large fluctuation can occur, causing the system to move into smaller, less thermally equilibrated compartments with lower entropy
- This allows for transitions between regions and , representing Hawking evaporation or gravitational collapse events.

#### Quantum State Reduction Compensates for Black Hole-Induced Information Loss

**Black Holes vs Hawking Radiation**

**Ease of Creating vs. Destroying Black Holes:**
- Important issue: same difficulty to build or destroy a black hole as Hawking radiation
- Liouville's theorem: phase space volume is preserved by the flow, cannot accumulate on one side or another (incompressible fluid analogy)
- Time symmetry argument: if we reverse clock, should get same answer as running forwards
  - Black holes and white holes are physically identical? (Hawking suggestion but not believed)

**Weyl Curvature Hypothesis (WCH):**
- Singularities absorb matter and destroy information
- Implications for the discussion of Hawkings box: unknown physics governing behavior is involved
- Time asymmetry introduced, different from Hawkings time-symmetric quantum gravity theory
- WCH causes ow lines to merge in region `8` (violation of Liouville's theorem)

**Quantum Mechanical Process of State Vector Reduction (R):**
- Compensates for merging of ow lines due to WCH
- Bifurcation of ow lines required: time-asymmetric process
- Example: photon emission from lamp has two possible outcomes, bifurcating phase space lines.

**Conclusion:**
Black holes and white holes have different implications in the context of quantum mechanics and general relativity. While Hawking suggested that they might be physically identical due to time symmetry, this idea is not widely accepted. The Weyl curvature hypothesis introduces a time asymmetry into the discussion and offers an alternative explanation for the behavior of ow lines in relation to black holes. R, a quantum mechanical process, may play a role in compensating for the merging of ow lines caused by WCH.

#### Gravitational State-Vector Reduction Quantum-Gravity Interplay

**Arguments for Linking WCH and R in Quantum Gravity Theory**

**Overview:**
- Suggestion: quantum mechanical state-vector reduction is linked to WCH (Wheeler's law of entropy conservation)
- Both imply major implications for correct quantum gravity theory (CQG)
- Discussion on when state-vector collapse might occur

**Arguments Favoring the Link:**
1. **Heuristic Argument**: State-vector reduction and WCH are intimately associated with second law of thermodynamics.
2. **Classical vs Quantum Phase Space**: Idea that correct theory requires a new type of mathematical space intermediate between Hilbert space and classical phase space.
3. **Technical Difficulties in Applying General Relativity to Quantum Theory**: Failure of rules of quantum theory to fit well with ideas of curved space-time geometry.
4. **Significant Amount of Curvature**: When this level is reached, linear superposition fails, and non-linear instability sets in, leading to a choice between alternatives and state-vector collapse.

**State-Vector Reduction:**
- Suggestion: ultimate phenomenon may be gravitational
- Connection to black holes: when not present, reduction can occur
- Acceptance of this view faces difficulties with bringing general relativity principles into quantum theory due to technical complications.

**Arguments Against the Link:**
- Uncertainty about building Hawking's box and idealizations involved therein.
- Difering points of view: some physicists suggest that a small nugget of black hole would remain.
- Postulating total volume of phase space as finite goes against basic ideas about black hole entropy and quantum systems.

**State-Vector Collapse:**
- When might it occur?
  - Acceptance of state-vector reduction as gravitational phenomenon leads to the question of when collapse should take place.
  - Connection to significant amount of curvature: when this level is reached, rules of linear superposition fail and non-linear instability sets in.

#### Quantum Gravity in Cloud Chambers and Gas Boxes

**One-Graviton Level and Reality Transition**

**Procedure R**:
- Occurs spontaneously in an objective way, independent of human intervention
- Aims to bring reality between quantum level (atomic, molecular) and classical everyday experiences
- Characterized by the Planck mass mp = 10^(5) grams

**Observation with Wilson Cloud Chamber**:
- Particle emits spherical wavefunction on decay
- Multiple possible particle tracks in superposition
- Ionization of vapor leads to multiple strings of condensing droplets
- Probability weighted collection of alternatives, only one realized in physical world

**One-Graviton Stage**:
- Approx. 1/100th of mp = 10^(-8) g
- Rough calculation suggests it occurs when a single droplet reaches this size
- Uncertainties and complexities remain, including differences in calculations for strings of droplets

**Alternative Manifestations of Quantum Effects**:
- Disturbance of gas atoms upon particle entry
- Cascading effect leading to disturbance of virtually every atom in the gas
- Two distinct spacetime geometries for superposition: particle entering and not entering

**Implications**:
- Procedure R can occur even without a manifest magnification of quantum eects
- The difference between two dierent spacetime geometries reaches the one-graviton level when it is unclear which geometry will be realized.

#### Quantum Gravity and State-Vector Reduction in Physics and Consciousness

**Quantum Mechanics and State Vector Reduction**

**Description of Quantum Mechanically**
- Initial consideration only original particle's positions in superposition
- After a short while, all atoms of gas must be included in complex linear superposition
- Two possible states: one where the particle enters the box and another it doesn't
- Extend this superposition to all the atoms in the gas
- Difference in gravitational fields of individual atoms
- When difference exceeds one-graviton level, state vector reduction occurs
- Particle has either entered or not, complex linear superposition reduces to statistically weighted alternatives

**Observation and State Vector Reduction**
- Cloud chamber used as a way for quantum mechanical observation
- Other types of observations (photographic plates, spark chambers) can be treated using the one-graviton criterion by approaching them like the box of gas above
- Work remains to be done in seeing how this procedure might apply in detail
- New theory required involves radical ideas about nature of spacetime geometry and relativity

**Notes:**
1. Proposed modifications to Einstein's equations: changing RICCI = ENERGY via higher-order Lagrangians, changing number of dimensions of spacetime, introducing supersymmetry, string theory. All these proposals are tentative in the terminology of Chapter 5.
2. Violation of all four symmetries normally denoted by T, PT, CT, and CPT is required for a new physical action to be involved when thinking or perceiving consciously.
3. Proposed quantum gravity explanation of initial state from Hawking (1987, 1988) has theoretical substance but lacks time-asymmetric input.
4. Forward and backward-time descriptions have the same probability calculation due to unitary evolution.
5. Probability of past event given future event can be understood by imagining entire history of universe and counting fraction of occurrences accompanied by desired event.
6. Allowing for longitudinal gravitons (virtual gravitons that compose a static gravitational field) is problematic in terms of clear mathematical definition.
7. Precise mass value obtained from calculations by Abhay Ashtekar requires caution due to theoretical problems and assumptions used.
8. Other attempts at objective theory of state vector reduction include Krolyhzy (1974), Krolyhzy, Frenkel, and Lukcs (1986), Komar (1969), Pearle (1985, 1989), Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber (1986).
9. Penrose has been involved in developing a non-local theory of space-time called twistor theory but it lacks essential ingredients for discussion here.

### 9 Real Brains And Model Brains

**Anatomy and Structure of Brain**
* **Brain**: Large, convoluted structure controlling actions and consciousness
* **Cerebrum**: Largest part, divided into left and right hemispheres (frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe)
+ Cerebrum has outer layers of grey matter (cortex) and inner regions of white matter
* **Cerebellum**: Smaller portion at back, resembling two balls of wool
* Other structures: pons, medulla, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, corpus callosum, etc.
* Human brain has larger cerebrum and cerebellum than other animals

**Functioning of Brain**
* **Cerebral Cortex**: Grey matter where computational tasks occur
+ Visual cortex: Interprets vision from both eyes (left side for left visual field, right side for right visual field)
+ Auditory cortex: Deals with sounds received on left and right sides
+ Olfactory cortex: Processes smells from nostrils
+ Somatosensory cortex: Handles touch sensations
* **Motor Cortex**: Concerned with activating movement of different body parts
+ Right motor cortex controls left-hand side of the body, left motor cortex controls right-hand side.
* Primary regions (visual, auditory, olfactory, somatosensory, and motor) are most directly concerned with input and output.
* Secondary regions process sensory information in a subtle way and create more complex plans.
* Tertiary or association cortex is where abstract and sophisticated brain activity occurs.

#### Cerebrums Role and Connected Brain Regions

**The Motor Homunculus and Cerebrum's Role in Movement:**

**Motor Homunculus**:
- Illustrates portions of frontal lobes that most directly activate movement
- Figures 9.4 and 9.5 provide an overview

**Cerebrum's Role in Movement**:
1. **External Sensory Data**: Enters at primary sensory regions, processed to varying degrees in secondary and tertiary regions
2. **Output (Movement)**: Achieved by activating primary motor regions
3. **Speech**: Particularly interesting since it's thought of as a uniquely human cognitive function
   * Most right-handed people and many left-handed ones have speech centers mainly on the left side of the brain
   * Essential areas: Broca's area in frontal lobe for formulation, Wernicke's area in temporal lobe for comprehension
4. **Processing**: Movement of activity from primary to secondary and tertiary regions as input is analyzed
5. **Action Implementation**: Signals sent to primary motor cortex, ultimately reaching muscle groups
6. **Internal Activity**: Can also carry on independently without specific sensory input (thinking, calculating, reminiscing)
7. **Cerebellum's Role**: Responsible for precise coordination and control of body movements; timing, balance, delicate actions
8. **Learning New Skills**: Initially controlled by cerebrum when learning, but once mastered, cerebellum takes over
9. **Other Brain Regions**: Hippocampus (stores long-term memories), corpus callosum (connects right and left hemispheres), hypothalamus (seat of emotions), thalamus (processing center).

#### Brain Structure and Consciousness Reticular Formation and Upper Brain-stem

**The Human Brain: Regions and Consciousness**

**Three Major Brain Regions:**
- **Hindbrain (Rhombencephalon)**: Includes cerebellum, reticular formation (part in midbrain and hindbrain), and oldest evolutionarily.
- **Midbrain (Mesencephalon)**: Sits between hindbrain and forebrain.
- **Forebrain (Prosencephalon)**: Consists of newly developed parts like cerebrum, corpus callosum, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, etc.

**Location of Consciousness:**
- No consensus on the relationship between brain state and consciousness.
- All parts are not equally involved; cerebellum is more automaton-like than cerebrum.
- Cerebrum likely more involved due to conscious decision making (e.g., walking) and complex plans.
- Penfield's argument: Upper brainstem, including thalamus and midbrain (especially reticular formation), may be the seat of consciousness.
  - Conscious awareness arises when this region is in communication with the appropriate cerebral cortex region.
- Other neurophysiologists suggest that reticular formation could be the seat of consciousness due to its association with general brain alertness and state of unconsciousness.
- Evolutionary argument against reticular formation: Ancient part, implying lower animals possess consciousness.
  - Counterargument: Low-level forms of consciousness in other creatures cannot be ruled out based on current evidence.

**Cerebellum vs. Cerebrum:**
- Controls detailed muscle movements during conscious actions (like walking) without requiring thought.
- Unconscious reactions, such as removing hand from hot stove or blinking, are likely mediated by spinal cord instead of the brain.

**Upper Brainstem and Consciousness:**
- Penfield's argument: Upper brainstem, including thalamus and midbrain (especially reticular formation), is involved in consciousness due to its role in communication with the appropriate cerebral cortex region for specific sensations, thoughts, memories or actions being consciously perceived or evoked at that moment.
- Conscious awareness arises when this region is active and in direct communication with the cerebral cortex.

#### Duality of Consciousness in Split-Brain Subjects

**Awareness and Consciousness in Different Species**

**Frogs, Lizards, Cod Shark:**
- Impression of conscious presence is weak
- No demand for self-awareness or sophistication

**Dogs, Cats, Apes, Monkeys:**
- Strong impression of conscious presence
- No demand for complex feelings or self-awareness

**Dreaming State:**
- Some form of awareness present at a low level
- Reticular formation and hippocampus may play roles in manifesting consciousness

**Viewpoints on Consciousness**
1. Simple Presence: Awareness can be associated with the simple feeling of existence, as observed in animals.
2. Complex Algorithms: Consciousness may result from the complexity or depth of an algorithm, such as those carried out by the cerebral cortex.
3. Language and Humanity: Consciousness is linked to human language abilities, which distinguish humans from other animals and enable subtle thinking and self-expression.
4. Left vs. Right Hemisphere: Some neurophysiologists believe consciousness is associated with the left cerebral cortex but not the right, while others view this as an odd perspective.

**Split Brain Experiments:**
- Subjects had corpus callosum severed for epilepsy treatment
- Left and right hemispheres behave as virtually independent individuals
- Communication between sides is primitive, primarily through emotional feelings
- Controversy over whether each side should be considered a separate conscious individual.

#### Visual Cortex and Conscious Perception

**Split Brain Research Findings:**
- Both hemispheres can be conscious as evidenced by P.S.'s ability to speak and have distinct desires
- Multiple consciousnesses may result from bifurcation after operation
- Blindsight experiments suggest some parts of cortex are more associated with consciousness than others
- Visual Cortex processing: certain regions process visual information before reaching the visual cortex, like the lower temporal lobe in blindsight cases.

**Split Brain Research: Consciousness and Hemispheres**
- Only left hemisphere can convincingly claim to be conscious due to language capabilities
- Right hemisphere may struggle with verbal questions regarding consciousness
- Two independent minds possible after bifurcation through split-brain procedure
- No operational way of deciding which consciousness is original before operation.

**Blindsight Phenomenon:**
- Damage to visual cortex can cause blindness in certain regions
- Patient D.B.: able to guess objects in blind area with near 100% accuracy despite no perception
- Two distinct processes: unconscious processing (lower temporal lobe) and conscious awareness (visual cortex)
- Training allows limited direct awareness for some areas previously outside of consciousness.

**Visual Cortex Processing:**
- Best understood region in the brain regarding visual information processing
- Some processing occurs in retina before reaching visual cortex
- Hubel and Wiesel's experiment: certain cells responsive to lines with specific angles in cat's visual cortex.

#### Understanding Neurons Signal Propagation in the Nervous System

**Neurons and Signal Transmission in the Brain**

**Introduction:**
- Neurons: versatile cells responsible for brain processing and achieving remarkable feats
- Central bulb containing nucleus called soma
- Long axon transmits output signals
- Dendrites receive input data

**Synapses:**
- Junction between neurons with synaptic knob attachment
- Synaptic cleft: narrow gap for signal transmission
- Signals propagated across synaptic cleft using neurotransmitter chemicals

**Nerve Bres Structure:**
- Cylindrical tube containing sodium, potassium, and chloride ions
- Net negative charge inside and positive outside in resting state
- Metabolic pumps maintain ion balance
  - Sodium pump: pumps sodium out through membrane
  - Potassium pump: pumps potassium in from outside

**Signals Propagation:**
- Not like electric currents, more complicated than wires
- Involves movement of ions across cell membrane
- Net negative charge inside and positive outside maintained by pumps.

#### Neurons as Digital Signal Processing Elements

**Nerve Signal Transmission Mechanism**
- Signal consists of region of charge reversal moving along nerve fiber (bre)
- At head, sodium gates open for sodium ions to flow inward, creating positive charge inside, negative outside
- Region causes potassium gates to open and potassium ions to flow outward, restoring negative charge on the inside
- Signal passes as it recedes, with pumps pushing sodium and potassium back to their original positions
- Universally used by vertebrates and invertebrates

**Insulation of Nerve Fiber (Myelin Coating)**
- Enables nerve signals to travel faster between relay stations
- Surrounds nerve fiber with insulating coating called myelin
- Color gives white matter of brain its characteristic appearance

**Nerve Transmission: Digital Computer-like Aspect**
- Signals are all-or-nothing phenomena, either present or not
- Comparison to digital computer logic gates
  * Similarities in all-or-nothing signals and current pulses
  * Truth tables describe logical operations for various inputs
  * Basic types: AND (&), OR (v), IMPLIES (), IF AND ONLY IF (<=>), NOT (~)

**Building Logic Gates from Neuron Connections (in Principle)**
- Possible to create logic gates using neuron connections based on the principles discussed above.

#### Neural Gate Construction and Brain Plasticity

**Neuron Logic Gates**
- Double pulse represents 1 (true) and single pulse represents 0 (false)
- **And Gate**: Two input neurons terminate as sole pair of synaptic knobs on output neuron, with threshold for firing being two simultaneous excitatory pulses
- **Not Gate**: Input signal comes along an axon which divides into two branches. One branch takes a circuitous route to delay the signal by the time interval between two pulses in a double pulse. Both bifurcate once more, with one branch from each terminating on inhibitory neuron while the other splits into direct and circuitous routes. Output axon has three parts terminating with inhibitory synaptic knobs on a final excitatory neuron, with remaining branches having excitatory synaptic knots
- **Comparison to Electronic Computers**: Logic gates can simulate neuron models, while detailed constructions indicate that systems of neurons can act as a universal Turing machine. However, there are differences between brain and computer action:
  - Neurons emit sequences of pulses, not just single ones
  - Neurons have a probabilistic aspect with varying results from the same stimulus
  - Brain timing is less precise than electronic circuits
  - Neurons are connected in a more random and redundant way than wired computers
- **Other Factors Favoring Brains**:
  - Neurons have huge numbers of synapses compared to few input/output wires in logic gates
  - Brain has much larger total number of neurons (10^11) compared to even the largest computer (10^9)
- **Brain Plasticity**: Interconnections between neurons are not fixed as in computers, but change all the time. Locations of axons and dendrites do not change, but synaptic connections can be modified

#### Neuroplasticity and Memory Formation in the Brain

**Brain Plasticity and Synaptic Connections**

**Synaptic Junctions**:
- Established in broad outline at birth
- Occur at dendritic spines, tiny protuberances on dendrites
- Contact between synaptic knobs and dendritic spines involves a narrow gap (synaptic cleft) of about 1/40th of a millimeter

**Change in Synaptic Connections**:
- Dendritic spines can shrink away or grow to make new contact
- Changes in synaptic connections provide means for storing information
- Brain plasticity is an essential feature of the brain's activity

**Mechanisms of Change**:
- Controversial whether changes occur within seconds or not
- One school of thought suggests changes can occur rapidly, as fast as memory storage
- Hebb synapse theory proposes strengthening/weakening based on neuron firing patterns
- Neural network models simulate rudimentary learning based on Hebb synapse theory
- More understanding required to fully grasp the mechanisms underlying brain plasticity

**Neurochemistry and Memory**:
- Certain neurochemical substances can enter intercellular fluid, influencing neurons distant from their source
- Different theories of memory depend on di erent varieties of these chemicals
- State of the brain can be influenced by chemicals produced by other parts of the brain (e.g., hormones)

**Parallel Computers and Consciousness**:
- Parallel computers have many independent calculations, unlike serial computers
- Motivated by imitating nervous system operation
- Two points: parallel computation is not inherently different from serial, just e ciency; conscious thought is unified, not multiple

#### Quantum Computation and Brain Activity Single-Photon Neurons and Retinal Superposition

**Relationship Between Consciousness and Quantum Mechanics in Brain Activity**

**Oneness of Conscious Perception**:
- Imagining deciding what to have for dinner involves a great deal of information
- A full verbal description might be quite long
- This oneness of conscious perception seems to conflict with the parallel computer model
- However, unconscious actions like walking or talking can occur simultaneously and autonomously without consciousness
- There may be a relation between this oneness of consciousness and quantum parallelism

**Quantum Parallelism in Brain Activity**:
- According to quantum theory, multiple alternatives at the quantum level can coexist in linear superposition
- A single quantum state could consist of a large number of different activities occurring simultaneously
- This is known as **quantum parallelism**
- Quantum parallelism could be relevant for modeling conscious mental states

**Role of Quantum Mechanics in Brain Activity**:
- Most discussions of neural activity have been classical, with some exceptions related to quantum phenomena like ions and neurotransmitter chemistry
- The retina is a place where **single photon events** can trigger macroscopic nerve signals in both toads and humans
- Cells with single-photon sensitivity do appear to exist in the human retina, although a threshold must be reached for them to fire
- It's unclear whether similar single quantum sensitive cells exist elsewhere in the brain
- Even if they did, the current understanding is that such signals would not exhibit characteristic quantum interference effects and would not be very useful

**Quantum Computers**:
- The concept of a **quantum computer** has been proposed to harness quantum parallelism for performing large-scale calculations
- If single quantum sensitive neurons were playing an important role in the brain, they could have interesting effects

#### Beyond Quantum Theory Exploring the Limits of Classical Computation

**Quantum Computing in Brain Functioning**

**Overview**:
- Quantum parallelism: two different computations happening simultaneously, but only one result is observed at the end
- Potential time-saving by performing multiple computations concurrently
- Limitations of quantum computers vs classical computers

**Possible Application in Brain Functioning**:
- Difficulty preserving quantum coherence due to brain's temperature
- One-graviton criterion: onset of observation that interrupts U process (unitary operation)
- Problems with conventional quantum theory in interpreting brain function

**Quantum Dependence in Digital Computation**:
- Classical systems suffer from instability problem and loss of accuracy over time
- Quantum mechanics prevents this degradation through discrete states, essential for digital computers
- Limitations of Schrdinger equation in preventing unwanted spreading and loss of accuracy

**Beyond Quantum Theory**:
- Questioning the adequacy of current classical and quantum theories to describe brains and minds
- Complex problems arising from applying these theories to understanding brain function.

#### Non-Algorithmic Thought Processes in Brain Function

**The Problem of Consciousness in Quantum Mechanics**

**Classical vs. Quantum Mechanics**:
- Classical mechanics cannot explain the non-algorithmic nature of thought processes
- Quantum mechanics without fundamental changes cannot account for the role of R (the action of a system) in consciousness

**The Role of U and R**:
- U: the evolution of a system over time
- R: the instantaneous change in state of a system at some stage

**Challenges in Understanding Consciousness**:
- Classical mechanics assumes that change is algorithmic
- Quantum mechanics introduces non-algorithmic elements, but these require further fundamental changes to be harnessed

**The Role of Computers vs. Brains and Minds**:
- Computers operate on algorithmic principles, whereas the situation with brains and minds is "very different"
- A plausible case can be made that there is an essential non-algorithmic ingredient in conscious thought processes

**Notes**:
1. **Ramsey Cajal**: The great Spanish neuroanatomist who first proposed that the nervous system consists of individual cells, the neurons.
2. **Logic Gates**: All logic gates can be constructed from just a few basic operations (~ and &)
3. **Comparisons Between Computers and Brains/Minds**:
   - Most transistors in computers are for memory, not logical action
   - With increased parallelism, more transistors could become involved in logical action
4. **Quantum Computing**:
   - The quantum computer concept is equally appropriate with any viewpoint on standard quantum mechanics
5. **Deutsch's Comments**:
   - Deutsch prefers the many-worlds viewpoint in quantum theory
   - This is not essential, as the quantum-computer concept is applicable regardless of one's perspective on standard quantum mechanics

### 10 Where Lies The Physics Of Mind?

**The Mind-Body Problem: Rethinking the Approach**

**Issues in Discussion:**
- Active vs passive aspects of mind-body problem
- Consciousness as a scientifically describable phenomenon
- Selective advantage conferred by consciousness
- Unconscious mind and awareness
- Speculations on the nature of consciousness

**Background Assumptions:**
1. Belief that consciousness is scientifically describable
2. Belief that consciousness does something useful for the creature possessing it
3. Consciousness as a passive concomitant or active influence
4. Teleological purpose of consciousness
5. Anthropic principle and its relevance to the mind-body problem
6. Division between conscious and unconscious mind
7. Subjective experiences and intuitive common sense as indicators of consciousness
8. Consciousness as a matter of degree, not an absolute presence or absence
9. Challenges in defining consciousness vs. mind and soul
10. Intelligence as the focus of AI research instead of consciousness

**Experiments Indicating Unconscious Awareness:**
- Patients under anesthesia can recall conversations
- Sensations blocked from consciousness can be recalled under hypnosis

**Consciousness: Degrees and Synonyms:**
- Consciousness = awareness (to some degree)
- Different levels of consciousness: feeling, memory, understanding, intention, self-awareness
- Awareness of dreams or influencing them while asleep

**Further Considerations:**
- Consciousness as a matter of degree vs. absolute presence
- Complexity in defining consciousness and its relationship with mind and soul.

#### The Active Role and Purpose of Consciousness

**Turing's Paper and Intelligence vs. Consciousness**
- Turing (1950) discussed "thinking" in his famous paper, not consciousness directly
- Intelligent beings require consciousness for true intelligence, as believed by the author
- If AI can simulate intelligence without consciousness, it may be unsatisfactory and redefine the term

**Consciousness vs. Unconsciousness**
- Operational distinction between conscious and unconscious entities: presence of consciousness might not always reveal itself
- No universally accepted criterion for manifestation of consciousness
- Common sense perception of consciousness in others is often correct, unlike curare-drugged children case

**Active Role of Consciousness**
- Humans can perceive the presence of consciousness through common sense
- Natural selection favored the evolution of conscious beings instead of unconscious automatons
- Conscious beings exhibit behaviors that are different from non-conscious ones, indicating an active effect on behavior.

#### The Advantages and Nature of Consciousness A Debate on Its Role in Predation

**Consciousness and Advantage in Creatures**
- Presence of consciousness is advantageous to creatures, but question is: what's the specific advantage?
- One idea: awareness can help a predator guess prey's behavior by imagining itself as prey.
  - Ineffective due to pre-existing consciousness assumption in prey and unlikely natural selection.
- Another idea: some element of consciousness may be inferred from the predator-prey relationship, but doesn't address real issue.

**Consciousness vs Programs**
- Computer programs containing descriptions don't give awareness or self-awareness to the system.
- Video camera example: no awareness or self-awareness; distinction between conscious and unconscious mental activity.
  - Suggestive of non-algorithmic/algorithmic difference in consciousness action.

**Conscious Thought vs Unconscious**
- Conscious thought required for new judgements and situations without predefined rules.
  - Difficult to define clear distinctions between conscious and unconscious mental activities.
- Judgements are manifestations of the action of consciousness, which proceeds differently than algorithmic processes.

**Reversal of Views on Consciousness and Unconsciousness**
- Traditional view: conscious mind behaves rationally while unconscious is mysterious.
- Author's line of reasoning reverses this; unconscious processes could be algorithmic but complicated, conscious thought is different but rationalizable as logical at a higher level.

#### Consciousness and Non-Algorithmic Judgement in Mathematics

**Gardner's Claim about Consciousness and Judgement Forming**

**The Judgment-Forming of Consciousness**:
- Sometimes, a computer cannot conceptualize the criteria for these judgements
- The conscious impressions themselves are the (non-algorithmic) judgments
- Conscious contemplation can enable truth ascertainment in mathematics beyond algorithmic methods, as seen in Gdel's theorem and other examples

**Non-Algorithmic Forming of Judgements**:
- Algorithms never ascertain truth; they require external insights to validate or criticize
- The ability to divine (intuit) truth from falsity is the hallmark of consciousness
- This judgement process may be non-algorithmic, as traditional algorithms may not be the most appropriate for solving a problem
- Consciousness can come into play when forming inspired judgements that require extracting relevant information and weighing it against each other

**The Limitations of Unconscious Algorithmic Actions**:
- As a mathematician, the author trusts their conscious attention more than unconscious algorithmic actions when making important decisions in mathematics
- Even simple arithmetic operations require conscious judgement to determine which operation is appropriate for a problem

**The Evolution of Effective Algorithms**:
- If we suppose that the human brain operates based on algorithms, natural selection could have driven their evolution and improvement
- However, natural selection alone cannot evolve the kind of conscious judgements about algorithm validity that we possess

#### The Non-Algorithmic Nature of Mathematical Insight

**Natural Selection and Computer Programs**

**Computer Programs**:
- Not directly created by natural selection
- Developed by human computer programmers
- May contain errors, even minor ones

**Limitations of Natural Selection for Algorithm Development**:
- Difficult to ascertain algorithm validity without insights
- Decisions about algorithm validity not algorithmic
- Outputs of algorithms difficult to evaluate without meanings and intentions
- Mutations in algorithms render them useless

**Challenges in Evolution of Consciousness**:
- Unclear how natural selection evolved consciousness
- Complexities of living beings, especially human brain, are astonishing
- Consciousness may depend on heritage and evolutionary history

**Consciousness vs. Algorithmic Computers**:
- Conscious objects could potentially be designed to achieve consciousness
- Advantages: no baggage from ancestry, designed specifically for the task
- Human consciousness may depend on heritage and evolution

**Gdel's Theorem and Non-Algorithmic Nature of Mathematical Insight**:
- Gdels theorem shows that mathematical truths cannot be fully captured by algorithms
- This suggests a non-algorithmic role for consciousness in forming mathematical judgments

#### Inspiration in Mathematics A Conscious Process

**Gdel's Theorem and Computability**

**Background:**
- Mathematical truth cannot be determined algorithmically for all propositions
- Gdel's theorem demonstrates this through the existence of undecidable propositions (Pk(k))
- Argument: human mathematical judgments are non-algorithmic

**Counterarguments:**
1. **Knowing the mathematician's algorithm**: To understand Pk(k) and its validity, we need to know the mathematician's algorithm. However, this objection is not convincing as:
   - Complex or obscure algorithms may exist within a human mind that cannot be known
   - Gdel's theorem aims for a reduction to absurdity (reductio ad absurda)
2. **Universal formal system**: Mathematical truth can be settled by a universal formal system equivalent to all mathematicians' algorithms. This system cannot be known as the one we use but drives us to the conclusion that human mathematicians actually use an obscure or complicated algorithm for deciding mathematical truth, which contradicts the essence of mathematics.
3. **Inspiration and originality**: Can inspirational thoughts and images be products of consciousness itself? Hadamard's book "The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field" discusses instances of inspiration as described by leading mathematicians. The nature of inspiration remains a topic for further discussion.

**Inspiration, Insight, and Originality:**
- Occasional flashes of new insights can be referred to as inspirational experiences
- These moments may involve thoughts and images that come mysteriously from the unconscious mind or originate in consciousness itself
- The nature of inspiration is a topic for further investigation.

#### Insightful Moments Inspiration in Mathematics and Science

**Henri Poincar's Eureka Moment: Fuchsian Functions and Non-Euclidean Geometry**

**Poincar's Intensive Period of Conscious Effort**:
- Struggled with the problem of Fuchsian functions, reached an impasse
- Then went on a geologic excursion and had a sudden insight

**The Idea That Came to Poincar**:
- Realized that the transformations used to define Fuchsian functions were identical to those in non-Euclidean geometry
- The idea came unexpectedly while he was on the bus, his conscious thoughts seemed elsewhere
- He felt a strong sense of certainty about the idea's validity

**Comparing Poincar's Experience to the Author's Own**:
- In the author's experience, ideas often come after some deliberate conscious effort, but in a relaxed state
- The author might be thinking vaguely about a problem and then have an idea, often accompanied by a sense of conviction

**The Author's Black Hole Insight**:
- Struggled with the black hole singularity problem
- Felt that removing exact spherical symmetry might avoid the singularity
- Had an insight while crossing the street, which led him to develop the concept of a "trapped surface" and prove a related theorem

**Key Points**:
- Poincar's sudden insight came unexpectedly during a moment of relaxation, not in intense concentration
- The author's own insights often come after some deliberate effort, but in a relaxed state
- Both Poincar and the author felt a strong sense of conviction about the ideas they had.

#### Aesthetics and Inspiration in Mathematics and the Arts

**Role of Aesthetics and Insight in Inspirational Thought**

**Anecdote about Trapped Surface Idea**:
- Author wonders what would have happened if an unimportant experience had occurred instead
- Recalled trapped-surface idea during the day, which led to a significant discovery

**Aesthetics and Insight**:
- Aesthetic criteria are paramount in the arts
- In mathematics and sciences, aesthetics may be incidental, but play a role in inspiration and insight
- Author's experience suggests that beautiful ideas are more likely to be correct than ugly ones
- Strong conviction of validity of inspirational idea is closely bound up with its aesthetic qualities

**Role of Aesthetic Criteria in Mathematical Thinking**:
- Rigorous argument is usually the last step
- Aesthetic convictions are important in making routine guesses towards a goal
- These judgments reflect conscious thinking
- The unconscious mind may play a vital role, but an effective selection process is needed to allow only ideas with reasonable chance of success to reach consciousness

**Originality and Consciousness in Inspirational Thought**:
- Putting-up process: Unconscious, creative generation of ideas
- Shooting-down process: Conscious judgment and evaluation of ideas
- Conscious shooting-down is central to genuine originality, while unconscious putting-up is necessary for any new ideas at all.

**Global Nature of Inspiration**:
- Poincar's anecdote illustrates how inspirational ideas can encompass a wide area of thought
- Artists may keep the totality of their creations in mind all at once (e.g., Mozart)

#### Exploring Non-Verbal Thought in Mathematics and Creativity

**Mozart's Creative Process**
- Mozart describes his musical compositions as coming to him in their entirety, not piece by piece
- The process is unconscious in the initial stages but becomes conscious during the arbiter of taste
- Globality of inspirational thought is remarkable in Mozart and other creative individuals

**Non-Verbal Thought**
- Hadamard's study on creative thinking refutes the notion that verbalization is necessary for thought
- Quotes from Einstein, Galton, and Hadamard himself support the idea of non-verbal thought in mathematical and artistic processes
- Difficulty translating thoughts into words is common among these thinkers
- Other forms of thinking, such as philosophizing, may be better suited to verbal expression
- Different individuals think in various ways; mathematical thinking can be analytical or geometrical.

**The Role of Both Sides of the Brain**
- Conscious mathematical thought requires a high level of consciousness and is not limited to the left hemisphere, as some may assume.

#### Animal Consciousness and Contact with Platos World Diverse Modes of Mathematical Thinking

**Animal Consciousness?**
- Question: Can non-human animals be conscious?
- Argument against consciousness based on lack of verbalization is untenable.
  - Mathematical thinking can be carried out without speech.
  - Right brain also capable of sophisticated thought (despite lack of verbalization).
- Chimpanzees and gorillas: ability to communicate using sign language, evidence of "Aha" experiences.
- Dolphins have large brains, complex sound signals; possible consciousness.
  * Controversy over their verbalization abilities.
  * Lack of prehensile hands may limit civilization but allow for philosophical thought.

**Contact with Plato's World**
- Differences in mathematical thinking among colleagues as an undergraduate student.
  * Geometric vs analytical approaches, difficulty comprehending verbal descriptions.
  - Forms unique images to understand concepts.
- Communication despite misunderstandings and differing mental models.
- Puzzle of how communication is possible through this procedure.
- Venturing an explanation: potential relevance to consciousness issues.

#### Algorithmic Consciousness and the Mind-Body Problem

**The Communication of Mathematical Truths:**
* Mathematics involves more than just conveying facts
* Facts in mathematics are necessary truths or falsehoods
* Understanding mathematical statements requires grasping concepts, not just precision
* Precision can inhibit communication initially
* Direct contact with Platonic world of mathematical ideas enables communication between mathematicians
* Mathematical discoveries broaden the area of contact, no new information is gained

**The Viewpoint on Physical Reality:**
* A strong AI viewpoint assumes algorithms exist independently of physical embodiment
* This requires a pre-existing mind to interpret languages and decoding arrangements as algorithms
* The strong AI perspective raises questions about how the physical world and Plato's world relate to one another (mind-body problem)
* My own viewpoint is different, believing that minds are not algorithmic entities.

#### Determinism and the Role of Consciousness in Quantum Mechanics

**Thesis: Non-Algorithmic Consciousness and Determinism**

**Commonalities Between Strong AI Viewpoint and Author's Perspective:**
- Both associate consciousness with sensing necessary truths, achieving contact with Plato's world of mathematical concepts.
- Recognize mind-body problem as related to how Plato's world relates to the real physical world.
- Believe there is deep underlying reason for the accord between mathematics and physics (SUPERB theories).

**Reality of Physical World vs. Mathematical Concepts:**
- Precision of SUPERB theories raises questions about their origin.
- Abstract mathematical concepts have almost concrete reality in Plato's world.
- Identification of these two worlds is a possibility.

**Non-Algorithmic Action and Free Will:**
- Essential non-algorithmic aspect to conscious action.
- Determinism vs. free will debate: Classical theories are deterministic but not necessarily effective; quantum mechanics introduces randomness; CQG may interpolate between U and R, containing non-algorithmic element.

**Computability vs. Determinism:**
- Distinction between computability and determinism.
- Classical uncertainty in weather prediction does not equal free will because the future is still determined but not calculable.
- Lack of computability doesn't necessarily mean CQG is non-deterministic or that initial conditions are unknown.

**Author's Perspective:**
- Plausible that non-algorithmic procedure (CQG) exists at quantum-classical borderline, interpolating between U and R.
- Future behavior not computable but still determined by past from the big bang.
- Openness to possibility that CQG might be deterministic but non-computable.

#### The Anthropic Principle Implications for Consciousness and Physics

**Determinism and the Universe**
- Discussion of different levels of determinism
  - Strong determinism: universe is fixed by precise mathematical scheme for all time
    - Could potentially allow for many-worlds interpretation
    - Uneasy about this resolution, feels inadequate for actual rules governing world
  - Weak determinism: just the right conditions exist for intelligent life in our location and time
- The Anthropic Principle
  - Addresses why conditions are right for existence of conscious life
  - Two forms: weak and strong
    - Weak anthropic principle: explains spatiotemporal location of intelligent life
      - Used effectively to explain coincidental numerical relations in physics constants
    - Strong anthropic principle: concerns all possible universes
      - Suggests that physical constants or laws are designed for intelligent life existence
        - Argued that we would not exist in other universes with different conditions
  - Controversial and often invoked when theorists lack good explanation
- Turning away from abstract speculation to a more scientific issue: Tilings and Quasicrystals.

#### Non-Local Quantum Growth of Quasicrystals

**Section Overview:** This section discusses an extraordinary discovery of quasicrystalline substances with forbidden symmetries, particularly icosahedral symmetry in three dimensions. The author raises the question about their assembly and growth, which is a matter of controversy among scientists. He proposes his opinion that these structures cannot be achieved through local adding of atoms but require non-local quantum mechanical processes.

**Quasicrystals:**
- Discovered in December 1984 by Israeli physicist Dany Shechtman and colleagues at the National Bureau of Standards
- Exhibit forbidden symmetries, such as icosahedral symmetry in all dimensions (Shechtman et al. 1984)
- Formed from tiny microscopic units to about a millimeter in size
- Later discovered other quasicrystalline substances and larger structures like Al-Li-Cu alloy

**Characteristics:**
- Patterns have almost translational symmetry and crystallographically impossible fivefold symmetry (Fig. 10.3)
- Assembly requires examining the state of the pattern at many atoms away from the point of assembly to avoid errors

**Controversy:**
- Outstanding issues regarding quasicrystal structure and growth
- Author proposes that these structures cannot be achieved through local adding of atoms but require non-local quantum mechanical processes (Fig. 10.4)

**Opinion:**
- Some quasicrystalline substances are highly organized and close in structure to tiling patterns discussed
- Assembly may involve many alternative atomic arrangements coexisting in complex linear superposition until one is selected based on physical conditions (quantum procedure R)
- Selection of appropriate solution might occur when the physical conditions are just right, reaching one-graviton level or equivalent

**Classical Crystal Growth:**
- Conventional picture: atoms come individually and attach themselves to a continually moving growth line

**Proposed Quantum Mechanical Assembly:**
- Many alternative atomic arrangements coexist in complex linear superposition during growth (U)
- Some arrangements grow into larger conglomerations, and at a certain point, one or a reduced superposition may be singled out as the actual arrangement (R)
- Selection of appropriate solution occurs when physical conditions are met and the one-graviton criterion is reached.

#### Speculation on Brain Plasticity and Consciousness Time Delays Quantum-Like Superposition and Non-Algorithmic Action

**Brain Plasticity and Quantum Physics Speculations**

**Background:**
- Brain is not like a computer but changes through synaptic adjustments affecting dendritic spines (Chapter 9)
- Growth or contraction of families of dendritic spines potentially influenced by concentrations of neurotransmitter substances

**Brain Plasticity and Quantum Physics:**
1. Changes in brain connections:
   - Controversial among neurophysiologists, but permanent memories formed quickly suggest fast changes
2. Conscious Decision-Making Processes:
   a) Kornhuber's Experiment (1976): Conscious decision takes over a second before action
       * Subjects recorded electrical signals during voluntary finger movement decisions
       * Gradual buildup of electric potential for up to 1.5 seconds beforehand
       * Contrast with much shorter response time to pre-programmed responses (about 0.2 seconds)
   b) Libet's Experiment (1979): Conscious awareness of external stimuli takes half a second
       * Patients with brain surgery consented to have electrodes placed in somatosensory cortex for study
       * Brain receives signal in about 0.1 seconds, but conscious awareness requires approximately half a second.

**Implications:**
- Longer decision-making processes may be non-algorithmic in nature if quantum gravity theory involves non-algorithmic elements.

#### Delayed Perception in Consciousness Time Lags in Action and Awareness

**Key Findings from Experiments on Consciousness and Perception:**
- Brain processes related to conscious awareness occur within a tenth of a second (Fig. 10.6)
- Electrical stimulation of somatosensory cortex can create the subjective impression of actual touch, but only if it lasts for half a second or longer
- If electrical stimulation is too brief (less than half a second), the subject does not experience any sensation at all
- Stimulation of somatosensory cortex can "mask" or prevent the normal skin-touching sensation from being consciously felt
- Awareness of external events occurs approximately half a second after they take place, based on Kornhubers experiment and Libets findings.

**Possible Interpretation:**
- Consciousness may be delayed by about half a second compared to actual time as if our internal clock is slightly off.
- Longer responses require more time for conscious processing (second part of Libet's experiment).
- Some events might not allow consciousness to play a role if the response needs to take place within a couple of seconds or less.
- Questions remain about the true nature of consciousness and its role in perception versus automatic responses.

#### Perception of Time and Consciousness in Music Composition

**Consciousness and Time Perception**

**Experts' Preprogrammed Responses:**
- Experts at certain pursuits have responses preprogrammed in cerebellar control
- Consciousness may not play a significant role in decision-making for these actions
- However, some degree of anticipation and conscious involvement is likely present

**Ordinary Conversation:**
- In everyday conversation, unexpected remarks can occur
- Response time is much less than second and a half

**Experimental Findings:**
- Kornhuber's experiments show conscious intentions emerge earlier than actions
- Later experimental findings by Libet suggest different interpretation

**Time Perception and Consciousness:**
- Time perception in consciousness may not follow physical rules
- Something illusory about the way time enters into conscious perceptions
- Evidence from Mozart's ability to perceive entire compositions quickly
  - Musical perception does not take comparable external time
  - Likely a musical interpretation, with temporal connotations essential
- Bach's unfinished "Art of Fugue" composition
  - Essentials held in composer's head without normal performance pace
  - Conceived in entirety to maintain intricate complexity and artistry.

#### The Nature of Consciousness and Quantum Gravity

**The Relationship Between Consciousness, Mathematics, and Time**

**Conceptualizing a Novel or History**:
- Contemplating various events requires mental enaction in real time, but this seems not to be necessary.
- Memories of one's own experiences can be compressed and re-lived in an instant of recollection.

**Similarities Between Musical Composition and Mathematical Thinking**:
- People might suppose that a mathematical proof is conceived as a logical progression, where each step follows upon the ones that have preceded it.
- The conception of a new argument requires globality and conceptual content that bears little relation to the time taken to fully appreciate a serially presented proof.

**Consciousness and Time**:
- Accepting that the timing and temporal progression of consciousness is not in accord with external physical reality.
- Teleological effects on consciousness could lead to paradoxical implications, like faster-than-light signaling.

**Proposal on Consciousness as Seeing Necessary Truths**:
- Recall: consciousness sees a necessary truth and represents contact with Plato's world of ideal mathematical concepts (timeless).
- Perception of Platonic truth carries no information in the technical sense and would not create actual contradictions if propagated backwards in time.

**Role of Consciousness**:
- If consciousness has an active role, it must fit with the physical determined and time-ordered action of the material brain.
- Answer lies in the way CQG (Chaos Quantum Gravity) resolves the conflict between quantum processes U and R.

**CQG and Consciousness**:
- EPR phenomena are non-local, which cannot be described consistently with special relativity.
- CQG provides an objective physical theory of state-vector reduction (R), avoiding the need to define consciousness.
- Once CQG is found, it may become possible to elucidate the phenomenon of consciousness in terms of it.

**A Child's View**:
- Strong AI proponents equate thinking with computation.
- Objections to strong AI: computers cannot evoke conscious awareness, cannot perceive beauty or emotions, and cannot have genuine autonomous purposes.
- Science drives us to accept that the world is governed by precise mathematical laws, but consciousness remains a subjective experience that doesn't fit within this framework.

#### Puzzles of Consciousness Exploring the Mysteries Beyond Computation

**Essential Elements Missing from Purely Computational Picture of Mind**
- Uncomfortable feeling that something essential is missing from purely computational picture
- Arguments aim to support view that consciousness cannot be accidental result of computation
- Consciousness essential for making universe's existence known, not just a product of complex computation
- Childlike wonder and basic questions arise with consciousness awakening (e.g., where consciousness goes after death)

**Challenges in Understanding Consciousness**
- Distinction between conscious mind and computer unclear
- Children's puzzles related to existence, identity, and the nature of time
- Resolving these questions requires a theory of consciousness
- Difficulty explaining conscious phenomena to non-conscious entities

**Notes on Mathematical Foundations**
1. Validity of proofs in formal systems always algorithmic
2. Distinctions between mathematicians' perspectives do not greatly concern us here
3. Dogmatic Gdel-immune formalist's perspective ignored as irrelevant to discussion
4. Animals' consciousness indicated by dreaming during sleep
5. Relativity theories: replace times with simultaneous spaces or spacelike surfaces
6. Infinite universe may contain infinitely many copies of oneself and environment
7. Problems with crystal growth could involve similar challenges as in quasicrystals.
