# Consciousness And The Universe
by Roger Penrose (Author), Stuart Hameroff (Author), Henry P. Stapp (Author), Deepak Chopra (Author), Subhash Kak (Editor) 

> Is consciousness an epiphenomenal happenstance of this particular universe? Or does the very concept of a universe depend upon its presence? Does consciousness merely perceive reality, or does reality depend upon it? Did consciousness simply emerge as an effect of evolution? Or was it, in some sense, always "out there" in the world? These questions and more, are addressed in this special edition.

## 1. Consciousness in the Universe Neuroscience Quantum Space-Time Geometry and Orch OR Theory
**Consciousness in the Universe**

**Introduction**:
- Consciousness: awareness, subjective experience, understanding, meaning, volitional choice, free will
- Three possibilities regarding the origin and place of consciousness in the universe:
    A. Consciousness is a biological adaptation, emerged as a result of brain evolution
    B. Consciousness has always been in the universe (spiritual, religious, panpsychist views)
    C. Precursors of consciousness have always been in the universe, biology evolved to convert them into actual consciousness
- Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) theory: consciousness as a quantum process related to spacetime geometry and brain biomolecular processes

**Consciousness from Brain Activity**:
- Brain produces consciousness, mechanism unknown
- Prevalent scientific view: consciousness emerges from complex computation among neurons
- \"Hard problem\": how cognitive processes are accompanied by conscious experience (qualia)
- Limitations of the brain-as-computer model:
    - Unaddressed distinctions between conscious and non-conscious processes
    - Non-computable thought and understanding
    - Binding and synchrony problem: unifying disparate neuronal activities into a single conscious experience
    - Causal efficacy of consciousness and free will

---

### Microtubules as Biomolecular Computers and Automata
**Brain and Consciousness: Alternative Perspectives**

**Dennett's Brain-as-Computer View of Consciousness:**
- Depicts consciousness as an illusion (epiphenomenal) based on measurable brain activity occurring after a response to stimuli

**Microtubules as Biomolecular Computers:**
- Precise and organized activities in single-cell organisms like Paramecium
- Self-assembling polymers of tubulin protein
- A-lattice structure suggests biomolecular computation capability

**Intelligent Functions of Microtubules:**
- Regulation of synapses within neurons
- Precise separation of chromosomes in cell division
- Complex behavior of Paramecium

**Microtubules as Biological Computers: Cellular Automata Theory**
- Hameroff's research on microtubules as computational devices (molecular automata)
- Interactions between neighboring tubulin bits in discrete time steps
- Complex computation and pattern generation capabilities

**Microtubules and Information Processing:**
- Suggested by Sherrington (1957) and Atema (1973) as potential information processors
- Hameroff's models of microtubules as molecular automata for cellular computation
- Discrete states of tubulin acting as bits, interacting via dipole-dipole coupling.

---

### Quantum State Reduction as a Consciousness Mechanism The OR Proposal
**Proteins and London Forces**
- Proteins are heterogeneous arrays of amino acid residues, including both polar and nonpolar groups
- Nonpolar groups coalesce during protein folding to form hydrophobic pockets
- London forces in hydrophobic pockets influence and determine protein state
- Anesthetics bind with electron clouds in these pockets, impairing normal London forces governing protein switching

**Tubulin and Microtubule Automata**
- Tubulin's hydrophobic regions and switching are clarified and updated
- Tubulins oscillate synchronously to synchronize discrete time steps in microtubule automata
- Frhlich coherence or condensation used for computational time steps in simulated microtubule automata
- Microtubules emit coherent excitations at 8 megahertz, suggesting classical synchrony

**Orch OR Proposal and Brain Information Processing**
- Tubulin oscillations and information capacity suggest another level of information processing in the brain
- Increased capacity alone does not address unanswered questions about consciousness
- Penrose's Emperor's New Mind argued for non-computable aspects of human consciousness, suggesting an extension to quantum mechanics (OR) as a possible solution.

---

### Quantum Measurement Paradox and its Implications for Consciousness
**Discussion of Penrose's OR Proposal and Quantum Mechanics:**
* Penrose's OR proposal: suggested in Penrose (1989), revised as Disi-Penrose proposal (DP) in Penrose (1995)
* Objective physical threshold for quantum-superposed states
* Not part of normal ideas used in quantum gravity
* Connection between consciousness and quantum measurement opposed to early quantum mechanics ideas
* Measurement problem: conflict between unitary evolution U and reduction R
* Niels Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation: wavefunction has no physical reality, measuring device behaves classically.

**Understanding Quantum Mechanics:**
* Discrete elements of energy (particles or subsystems) related to fundamental frequencies through Planck's formula
* Wave/particle duality: both partial pictures do not convey true nature of quantum entities
* Laws governing quantum entities differ from classical world
* Superpositions: multiple coexisting alternatives, described mathematically by a quantum wavefunction
* Non-local entanglement: separated components connected through common quantum wavefunction.

**Measurement Problem in Quantum Mechanics:**
* Conflict between unitary evolution U and reduction R
* Arises from considering measuring apparatus as a quantum entity
* Many ways to approach this problem, including the Copenhagen interpretation proposed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg.

### Quantum Mechanics and the Problem of Observation in Orch OR
**Wave Function and Measurement**
- Wave function does not have physical reality, only reflects observer's knowledge of quantum system
- Observer's measurement results cause a \"jump\" in wavefunction, attributed to observer's changing knowledge state
- Some physicists view this as a stopgap until a more complete quantum ontology can be developed

**Copenhagen Viewpoint**
- Consciousness outside science, doesn't address nature and physical role of superposition or Schrdinger's cat thought experiment
- Observer's consciousness reduces state before interaction with apparatus, alternatives still exist in superposition beforehand
- Interaction with environment erodes quantum states, no consistent ontology for reality

**Objective Reduction Schemes (OR)**
- Proposed solutions to quantum mechanics' irrelevance to consciousness
- Orch OR uses a specific OR extension to bridge quantum and classical physics
- Different interpretation of quantum gravity from conventional ideas

**Schrdinger's Cat Thought Experiment**
- Highlights absurdity of applying rules of quantum mechanics at macroscopic level
- Cat in box faces death if radioactive atom decays, resulting in cat being both dead and alive according to U-evolution
- Conscious observer needed to determine cat's fate, emphasizes incompleteness of current theory.

### Orchestrated Reduction in Quantum Consciousness Microtubules and Planck Scale Geometry
**OR Theory: Alternative Perspective on Quantum Reduction**

**OR Theory**:
- Rejects standard quantum theory's reduction of the quantum state (collapse of the wave function) as a final answer
- Sees reduction as a physical phenomenon, not just an effect of environmental decoherence or convenience
- Result of merging principles of general relativity with conventional unitary quantum formalism

**Quantum Measurement**:
- Reduction is a real, objective physical process
- Occurs when quantum superpositions become unstable due to mass displacement between alternatives
- Estimated time scale: /EG = hbar * E_gravitational self-energy of mass distribution difference

**OR Process**:
- Not an entirely random process like standard theory
- Acts according to new physics beyond computation (Penrose, 1989, 1994)
- Consciousness associated with highly organized structures and orchestrated form of OR occurrences

**Planck Scale Quantum Geometry**:
- Elements of proto-consciousness tied to tiny differences in space-time geometry (10^(-35m), 10^(-43s))
- OR occurs when these small space-time differences reach the Planck level

**Role of Gravity and Biological Energy**:
- Gravitational energy EG plays a supporting role, not in competition with usual biological energies
- Extreme weakness of gravity necessitates large amounts of material for coherent mass displacement between superposed structures

**Microtubules**:
- Central to these structures undergoing biological quantum computation (A-lattice microtubules)
- Provide a subtle yet direct connection to Planck-scale geometry, leading to conscious experience moments.

---

### Quantum Superposition and Consciousness in the Brain Orch OR Proposal
**Penrose's Proposal: Objective Reduction (OR)**
- **Space-time separation**: OR occurs when the overall degree of separation, a product of temporal and spatial displacement, reaches critical amount, roughly unity (Penrose, 1993)
- **Gravitational self-energy EG**: Estimated by calculating gravitational energy between mass distributions in superposed states (Penrose, 1993; 1995)
- **Critical point for OR to occur**: When the average of EG is less than a certain threshold value (estimated as unity in absolute units)
- **Small temporal separation T**: Longer lifetime for superposed state
- **Large spatial separation S**: Shorter lifetime for superposed state
- **Environmental decoherence**: Not required for OR to take place, but can lead to uncontrollable randomness and indistinguishability from conventional quantum mechanics
- **Testing OR proposal**: Experimental testing is close to the borderline of what can be achieved with present-day technology (Marshall et al., 2003)

**Implications for Experiments**:
- Coherent superpositions of sufficient amounts of material, undisturbed by environmental entanglement, are required for OR to occur in the brain
- Neural correlates of consciousness, such as particular frequencies of electroencephalography (EEG), might be associated with time scales of general order of a conscious experience, about 100 ms

**Quantum Computing and Consciousness**:
- Quantum computers represent information as qubits in superposition of both 1 and 0, enabling complex and highly efficient parallel processing (Benioff, 1982; Deutsch, 1985; Feynman, 1986)
- Proposal that some form of quantum computing could be occurring in the brain, following the Schrdinger equation without decoherence until a threshold for non-computable OR is reached (Penrose, 1989)
- No plausible biological candidate for quantum computing in the brain was available to Penrose at that time due to his unfamiliarity with microtubules.

---

### Quantum Consciousness and Microtubules in Neurons
**Orch OR Consciousness Model**

**Background:**
- Penrose and Hameroff teamed up in the early 1990s to apply the DP form of Objective Reduction (OR) mechanism to microtubule automata models for consciousness
- Questions addressed: How does EG relate to consciousness? What is EG in terms of superpositioned microtubules?

**Relationship between Consciousness and OR Events:**
- In Orch OR, consciousness is seen as a sequence of discrete OR events in conjunction with neuronal activities
- The time for evolution of the pre-conscious quantum wavefunction between OR events (the time interval between conscious moments) can be taken to be equivalent to gamma synchrony EEG (30-90 Hz)

**Calculating EG:**
- Three types of mass separation were considered: protein spheres, atomic nuclei, and nucleons
- The most plausible calculation is separation at the level of atomic nuclei, giving EG as a superposition of 2x10^11 tubulins reaching OR threshold in 25 milliseconds
- With 1% of tubulins per neuron in superposition, only a few hundred neurons are required for a 25msec gamma synchrony OR event

**Spectrum of Conscious Events:**
- Orch OR allows for a spectrum of possible conscious events, including higher frequency and intensity events
- Tibetan monk meditators exhibit 80 Hz gamma synchrony, requiring more brain involvement compared to 40 Hz consciousness

**Alternative Viewpoint:**
- Conscious influences might occur at a slower pace than suggested by current considerations (1/2 second or so)
- It is best not to be dogmatic about how the ideas of OR are applied at this uncertain stage.

### Quantum Computation in Microtubules and Orchestrated Objective Reduction in Biology
**Microtubule Quantum Computation and Orch OR**

**Numerical Assignments**:
- Extremely rough assignments
- Open mind required to determine precise operation of Orch OR

**Decoherence in Microtubules**:
- Technological quantum computers face decoherence issues
- Proposed mechanisms for microtubule quantum states:
  - Pumped by Frhlich resonance and shielded by various factors (water, C-termini Debye layers, actin gel, strong mitochondrial electric fields)
  - Originate in hydrophobic pockets with limited polar interactions
  - Involve superposition of atomic nuclei separation
  - Geometrical resonances enable topological quantum computing and error correction

**Experimental Evidence**:
- Some evidence of \"superconductivity\" in living A-lattice microtubules at body temperature
- Studies demonstrate quantum coherence in warm biological systems, including proteins involved in photosynthesis and bird brain navigation
- Findings from studies on microtubules:
  - Eight resonance peaks for AC stimulation (kilohertz to 10 megahertz)
  - Excitation at resonant frequencies causes rapid assembly through Frhlich condensation
  - Ballistic electronic conductance along helical quantum channels
  - Eight distinct quantum interference patterns and memory capacity
  - Temperature-independent conductance suggests quantum effects

**Integration in Neurons**:
- Microtubule quantum computation occurs in dendrites and cell bodies/soma of brain neurons
- Integration of information is the neuronal function most closely associated with consciousness
- Dendritic/somatic integration correlates best with local field potentials, gamma synchrony EEG, and anesthetic effects.

---

### Quantum Computation in Microtubules and Consciousness Evolution
**Dendritic Microtubules:**
* Arranged in local mixed polarity networks for integration of synaptic inputs
* Membrane synaptic inputs interact with post-synaptic microtubules through MAP2 and CaMKII

**Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR):**
* Proposed mechanism for quantum computations in microtubules to tune or orchestrate OR-mediated processes
* Microtubule quantum computations may alternate with classical environmental interaction at gamma synchrony
* Dendritic/somatic microtubules receive and integrate synaptic inputs during classical phase, become isolated quantum computers for Orch OR reduction
* Particular tubulin states chosen in reduction can trigger axonal firing, adjust threshold, regulate synapses, and encode memory

**Orch OR in Evolution:**
* Non-conscious neuronal activities may proceed by classical neuronal and microtubule computation or quantum computations that do not reach Orch OR level
* Orch OR depends on /EG; more primitive consciousness involves smaller EG and longer times to avoid decoherence
* Central nervous systems with smaller EGs, such as those present in early Cambrian evolution, could have near one minute of conscious moments and be feasible for avoiding decoherence
* Human brains may have evolved to having Orch OR conscious moments frequently every few milliseconds

**Microtubule Quantum States Extending:**
* Tunneling and entanglement between adjacent neurons through gap junctions proposed by Orch OR
* Gap junctions: open electrical connections between cells, synchronizing membrane polarization states and allowing passage of molecules between cytoplasmic compartments
* Quantum states in microtubules in one neuron could extend to other neurons and glia through gap junctions and form brain-wide syncytia.

### Microtubule-Consciousness Relationship and Criticisms of Orch OR Theory
**Consciousness and Gamma Synchrony: Role of GaP Junctions**
- **Gamma synchrony**: best measureable correlate of consciousness (Hameroff, 1998a)
- Depends on gap junctions, especially dendritic-dendritic ones (Dermietzel, 1998; Draguhn et al., 1998; Galaretta and Hestrin, 1999)
- Hameroff's Conscious Pilot Model: Syncytial zones of dendritic gamma synchrony move around the brain
- Regulated by gap junction openings and closings
- Microtubules play a role in this regulation

**Libet's Experiments on Conscious Perception**
- Libet performed experiments on patients undergoing brain surgery while awake (Libet et al., 1979)
- Determined conscious perception of a stimulus required up to 500 ms post-stimulus, but conscious awareness occurred at 30 ms
- This is known as the \"backward time referral\" phenomenon

**Quantum Entanglement and Consciousness**
- Penrose suggested that quantum entanglement may be related to the backward time referral phenomenon (Penrose, 2004)
- Quantum entanglement, or quanglement, allows for temporal non-locality within Orch OR scheme
- This can enable conscious experience to be temporally non-local and provide a causal effect

**Orch OR Criticisms and Responses**
- Criticized repeatedly since inception by philosophers Grush and Churchland (1995)
- Objections include the Gdel's theorem argument and biological factors like colchicine use for treating diseases. However, these criticisms have been addressed through various responses.

---

### Challenges to Orchestrated Objective Reduction Theory and Responses
**Penrose and Hameroff's Response to Critics:**
- Responded point-by-point to objections, e.g., explaining colchicine doesnt cross the blood brain barrier
- Colchicine infused directly into the brain causes severe cognitive impairment
- Tuszynski et al questioned how weak gravitational energy in Discipline Penrose could influence tubulin protein states
- Calculated gravitational self-energy EG for tubulin superposition, found to be extremely small (10^-27 eV per tubulin) compared to other energies involved in physical processes
- Energy uncertainty allows quantum state reduction without violating energy conservation
- No other forces contribute to EG, which is necessary for Orch OR consistency

**Decoherence Argument:**
- Physicist Max Tegmark confronted Orch OR based on decoherence
- Koch and Hepp's thought experiment assumed Orch OR followed Copenhagen interpretation, opposite of Orch OR
- Orch OR can account for bistable perceptions (face/vase illusion) through non-conscious superposition reduction among microtubules in neurons
- Weak Frhlich condensation found in microtubules by Reimers et al contrasted with strong and coherent Frhlich condensation required for Orch OR, leading to conclusion it's invalid

**Misconceptions about Microtubules:**
- McKemmish et al challenged the claim that tubulin switching is mediated by London forces, stating mobile electrons in a benzene ring cannot exist in superposition of both states. Agreed. However:
  - A single benzene ring cannot engage in switching, but microtubules are complex structures with multiple attachment sites for microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) where strong Frhlich coherence has been observed.

---

### Quantum Hydrophobic Channels in Tubulin
**London Forces and Orch OR**
- London forces occur between two or more electron cloud ring structures or non-polar groups, not in a single benzene ring
- Two (or more) non-polar groups are necessary for London forces
- McKemmish et al are mistaken on this point

**Misconceptions about Orch OR**
- Tubulin switching does not require significant conformational change as suggested by Figure 2
- Electron cloud dipole states (London forces) are sufficient for bit-like switching, superposition and qubit function
- Early publications and illustrations in Orch OR were misleading with significant conformational changes
- Tubulin's only conformational factor is superposition separation involved in EG, the gravitational self-energy of the tubulin qubit

**Tubulin Conformational Factors in Orch OR**
- The dominant effect is atomic nuclei separation at 2.5 femtometers (2.5 x 10^-15 meters)
- This shift can be accounted for by London force dipoles with Mossbauer nuclear recoil and charge effects
- No significant conformational changes are required for tubulin switching in Orch OR

**Schematic Depiction of Tubulin Bit, Qubit, and Hydrophobic Pockets in Orch OR**
- An updated version of the schematic depiction is described in the next section
- Figure 10 shows four versions of the Orch OR tubulin bit:
  - Early version with a single hydrophobic pocket coupled to conformational change driven by GTP hydrolysis
  - Updated version with a single hydrophobic pocket composed of four aromatic rings
  - McKemmish et al's mischaracterization of Orch OR tubulin bit as irreversible conformational change driven by GTP hydrolysis
  - Current version of Orch OR bit with no significant conformational change (change occurs at the level of atomic nuclei) and multiple hydrophobic pockets arranged in channels.

**Topological Quantum Computing in Orch OR**
- Quantum processes in Orch OR are ascribed to London forces in tubulin's non-polar, intra-protein regions (e.g., electron resonance rings of aromatic amino acids like tryptophan and phenylalanine)
- Based on Frhlich's suggestion that protein states are synchronized by electron cloud dipole oscillations in non-polar regions and anesthetic gases selectively erasing consciousness by London forces in non-polar hydrophobic regions in various neuronal proteins.
- London forces are weak but numerous, allowing cooperative regulation of protein states.

---

### Quantum Hydrophobic Channels in Microtubules for Topological Quantum Computing
**Topological Quantum Computing in Orch OR**
- Topological quantum computing proposed as basis for Orch OR
- Qubits based on topological pathways, called anyons
- Anyons travel along braided pathways, forming logic gates
- Intersections form information states or bits
- Superposition of multiple pathways leads to reduction and functional output
- Intrinsically resistant to decoherence

**Orch OR and Topological Qubits in Microtubules**
- Suggestion of Orch OR based on topological quantum computing in microtubules
- Hydrophobic channels, e.g., Fibonacci helical pathways proposed as topological bits and qubits
- Cooperative London forces enable long-range coherence and topological quantum computing in microtubules

**Comparison with Orch OR**
- OR (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) is a criterion for proto-consciousness
- Not equivalent to actual consciousness due to constant occurrence of random measurements
- Strict conditions required for Orch OR: superposition must be isolated from decoherence effects for sufficient length to reach threshold
- Large superpositions can occur within sufficiently large collections of microtubules in the brain for a fraction of a second

**Implications and Speculations**
- Universe's dimensionless physical constants may favor conscious life
- Possibility of sentient beings in other parts of the universe, such as neutron stars
- Anthropic principle: Discussion on the coincidence that these constants enable conscious life
- Relevance to conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) and questions related to Orch OR proposal answerability.

**Conclusion**
- Orch OR provides a possible route for rational argument regarding alien sentient beings in the universe
- Places consciousness at a central place in the physical nature of our universe, whether or not it includes other aeons.

## 2. Cosmological Foundations of Consciousness
**Cosmological Foundations of Consciousness: An Overview**

**Introduction:**
- Explores the cosmological foundations of consciousness in biological brain through symmetry-breaking, biogenesis, evolutionary diversification, and human emergence.
- Offers a new perspective on quantum interactions in consciousness and its relationship with cosmology.
- Refers to research monograph (King, 2011b) for detailed explanations and references.

**Cosmic Symmetry-Breaking:**
1. Life as a result of interactive complexity from symmetry-breaking after the Big Bang:
   - Fundamental forces differentiate into strong, weak nuclear, gravity, and electromagnetism.
   - Gravity and electromagnetism govern long-range structure determining biogenesis through fractal chemical bonding.
2. Hierarchical interaction of forces leading to hierarchical organization:
   - Hadrons, atomic nuclei, molecules generated by nonlinear energy of chemical bonding.
   - Cascade of cooperative weak-bonding effects responsible for molecular complexity from orbital interactions to cell structures and organisms.
3. Chaotic effects of gravity leading to planetary variation:
   - Extreme conditions generating potentiality for biogenesis similar to dynamic variations surrounding the Mandelbrot set.

**Nonlinear Quantum Theory and Biological Foundations:**
1. Cosmic symmetry-breaking results in hierarchical arrangement of quarks into stable atomic nuclei with graduated energies.
2. Non-linear molecular orbitals lead to strong covalent and ionic bonds, H-bonds, van der Waals interactions creating primary, secondary, tertiary structures of proteins and nucleic acids.
3. Fractal manner of quaternary supra-molecular assemblies, cell organelles, cells, tissues, and organisms development.

### Symmetry-Breaking The Origin and Evolution of Lifes Elemental Structure
**Symmetry-Breaking and Life Origins**

**Gene Coding and Cellular Structures**
- Necessary condition for development of cells and organisms
- Possible due to symmetry-broken laws of nature
- Tissue, including sentient brain, is product of cosmic symmetry-breaking

**Periodic vs. Non-periodic Trends in Elements**
- Periodic quantum properties of s, p, d and f orbitals form the basis of the table of elements
- Non-linear interactions result in symmetry-breaking, determining bioelements for biogenesis
- Strong covalent bonding between first row elements C, N, O, H forms the basis of life

**Optimality of Water and Symmetry-Breaking Properties**
- Electronegativity increases from non-polar C-H to highly electron negative O
- Result in optimal properties of water as a polar hydride
- Bifurcation into polar and non-polar phases, pH effects, H-bonding dynamics define aqueous structures

**Secondary Properties and Catalytic Roles**
- Sulfur's secondary properties: -SH and -SS- bonds
- Role of phosphorus in energy metabolism, dehydration polymerization, nucleic acid backbone
- Bifurcations of ionic properties K+ /Na+, Ca2+ /Mg2+
- Catalytic roles of transition elements as trace ingredients

**Cosmological Significance and Further Research**
- Potential for other arrangements of elements to support life
- Recent research on HCN and HCHO synthesis into nucleotide units, self-assembly of RNAs into catalytic functions
- Evidence of viral-based cellular transition from RNA world to DNA based chromosomes.

**Universal Common Ancestor of Life: From Univeral Commons to Eueryotes**
- Transition through an era when RNA functioned as both catalyst and replicator
- Establishment of the genetic code, with ribosomal protein translation units still RNA-based
- Eventual emergence of DNA-based life possibly through viral genes

**Independent Cellular Origins: Bacteria and Archaea**
- Genetic picture consistent with independent cellular origins of bacteria and archaea
- Implies more than one evolution of cellular life from a protected environment conducive to naked nucleotide replication

**Excitability in Early Life Forms: From Universals to Eueryotes**
- Excitability based on ion channels and pumps became universal early on
- Massive genetic expansion around 3.3 billion years ago, facilitated by high levels of horizontal gene transfer
- Rapid presentation rate of new combinations compared to current computers suggests evolution as a two-phase process of genetic algorithm supercomputation solving protein folding problems for central metabolic and electrochemical pathways.

---

### Dynamic Structure of Conscious Brain Evolution and Complexity
**Horizontal Gene Transfer and Evolution of Neurological Components**
- Horizontal gene transfer, endosymbiosis, and gene fusion contributed to the emergence of sexuality, excitability, neural dynamics including ion channels for Ca+, K+, Na+, G-protein receptors, microtubules, fast action potentials in multi-cellular eukaryotes (Wickramasinghe 2011)
- Ion channel structure was established during the evolution of eukaryotes through lateral gene transfers
- Universal presence of neurological components like neurotransmitter receptors (GABA a, b; glutamate; opioid; dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, and melatonin) in all multi-cellular eukaryotes implies a deeper common neurodynamic and genetic basis

**Role of Chaos and Excitability in Eukaryote Cells**
- Chaotic excitation provides a generalized quantum sense to eukaryote cells through feedback about their external environment via various quantum modes: chemical, electromagnetic, electrochemical, acoustic, mechanical, and osmotic interactions (Wickramasinghe 2011)
- Complexity arising from cellular design rather than neural net architecture enables adaptive capacity in nervous systems, such as Hydra's rich repertoire of locomotion and coordinated tenacle movements

**Dynamic Features in Central Nervous Systems of Vertebrates**
- Interacting excitatory and inhibitory neurons provide a basis for broad spectrum oscillations, phase coherence, and chaos in global dynamics (Freeman 1991; Basar et al. 1989)
- Synaptic organization enables the resolution of complex context-sensitive decision-making problems
- Conscious attention is based on sensory input and short-term anticipation of immediate existential threats and opportunities, similar to single-celled organisms

**A Dynamical View of the Conscious Brain**
- The brain utilizes dynamic processing involving broad-spectrum oscillations rather than discrete signals (Freeman 1991; Basar et al. 1989)
- Massively parallel design with perhaps the order of 10 synapses between input and output enables quick reactions to complex stimuli in real time and avoids the interactability problem of serial computers
- The cerebral cortex consists of six layers organized in a functional columnar architecture, representing one aspect of experience per column (primary processing of lines, colors, motion, auditory tones, faces, motor events, strategic planning, execution, spatial abstractions, semantics, symbols, and temporal relationships between experiences).

---

### Quantum Dynamics in the Brain A Possible Basis for Conscious Intentions
**Holographic Model and Consciousness**
- Consistent with holographic model: experiences represented collectively in terms of attributes
- No single cortical area identified as seat of consciousness

**Proposed Model for Conscious Processes**
- Coordinated activity of whole brain engaging active communication in working memory between frontal cortex and major sensory and association areas
- Conscious processes correspond to global workspace (Baars, 1997)

**Modulation of Brain Activity**
- Cortex energized by ascending pathways from brain stem: reticular activating system, dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin
- Emotional experiences modulated through limbic system: hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala
- EEG oscillations in gamma band (30-80 Hz) distinguish conscious thought processes from peripheral preprocessing

**Chaos and Consciousness**
- Brain uses phases of dynamical chaos in time domain for perception, insight learning, eureka moments
- High energy chaos frees dynamic from getting locked into inappropriate solutions; reduces energy causing fall into recognized state or new attractor through adaptive change
- Non-linear mode-locking facilitates coherent excitations and resolves binding problem

**Quantum Dynamics in Brain Functioning**
- Exploring how whole brain states might become capable of quantum interaction to enhance survival prospects
- Ion channels, synaptic release display non-linear concentration dynamics and biochemical feedback loops
- Single vesicle excites up to 2000 ion channels providing extreme amplification for potential quantum event
- Voltage gated ion channels exhibit fractal kinetics.

---

### Quantum Entanglement and Consciousness in Neurophysiology
**Quantum Chaos and Consciousness**

**Discovery of Quantum Entanglement in Molecular Kinetics**:
- Electron in orbit around a Cesium atom enters entanglement with nuclear spin
- Illustrates how chaotic molecular kinetics can become entangled with quantum states
- Characteristic of time-dependent quantum chaos: transient chaotic behavior ends up in periodic orbital scar as wave spreading occurs
- Suggests that **chaotic sensitivity**, with increasing dominance by quantum uncertainty over time, contributes to which entanglements occur during kinetic encounters

**Evolutionary Argument**:
- Quantum attributes making subjective consciousness possible must evolve in conjunction with essential physiological processes
- Many theories of consciousness invoke unusual interpretations of physics or hypothetical fields beyond known physiology, raising questions about their evolutionary testability

**Bernroider's Proposal**:
- Quantum coherence can be sustained in ion channels long enough to be relevant for neural processes
- Ion channels could be entangled with surrounding lipids, proteins, and other channels in the same membrane
- Solitonic nature of action potentials provides entangled connectivity between channels

**Wheeler's Delayed Choice Experiment**:
- Demonstrates that a decision can be made after a photon from a distant quasar has traversed a gravitationally lensing galaxy, suggesting the final state at the absorber can determine past history of the photon
- Quantum erasure enables a distinction already made to be undone after the photon is released, preventing interference
- Feynman diagrams show similar time-reversible behavior, including time-reversed electron scattering being identical to positron creation-annihilation

**Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics**:
- In which space-time handshaking between the future and past becomes the basis of each real quantum interaction
- Emitter sends out an offset wave forwards and backwards in time, whose energies cancel
- Prospective absorbers respond with confirmation waves, and the real quantum exchange arises from constructive interference between the retarded component of the chosen emitter's offset wave and the advanced, time-reversing component of the chosen absorber's confirmation wave

**Potential Role for Consciousness**:
- Suggested that consciousness may play a role in collapsing the superposition of quantum states to one real instance experienced
- If so, consciousness may have a direct window on the entangled sub-quantum realm

---

### Quantum Anticipation and Sensory Experience in Consciousness
**The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics:**
* Boundary conditions for wave function exchange involve past and future states of the universe
* Real particle traveling from emitter to absorber is identical with its negative energy anti-particle traveling backwards in time (heuristic device, not essential)
* Wave function extending back to creation event and forward again for entangled particles

**Advanced Entanglement:**
* Experiments show correlations between two entangled particles with no defined polarization beforehand
* Only way to maintain correlation is through wave function extending back to creation event and forward again
* Quantum indeterminacy in brain state, consciousness provides intuitive hunch instead of causal deduction

**Possible Basis for Subjective Consciousness:**
* Excitable cells evolved ability to anticipate threats and opportunities through quantum non-locality
* Temporal anticipation not of causal effectiveness but small statistical advantage complemented by computational brain processes

**Quantum Phenomena in Biological Systems:**
* Entanglement observed in healthy tissues (quantum coherence MRI, bird navigation) and photosynthesis
* Excitations in neurons use quantum tunneling for enzyme activation energy transition states and synaptic transmission

**Subjective Consciousness and Evolutionary Advantage:**
* Sensory experiences differ from electrodynamics, possibly related to quantum modes of interaction with the physical world
* Longer evolutionary time since Archaean expansion may have led to quantum anticipation as an evolutionary feature in single-celled organisms before metazoa emerged.

### Complementarity and Symmetry Breaking in Consciousness and Cosmology
**Peripheral Sensory Transduction and Brain Expressions of Related Genes:**
- Many genes associated with peripheral sensory transduation in various senses, including touch (stomatin-like protein 3), hearing (epsin, otocadherin, and otoferlin), and vision (rhodopsin, encephalopsin) expressed in the mouse brain.
- This suggests the brain may have an internal sensory system that could play a role in generating an internal model of reality. However, these ideas are speculative.

**Neural Excitation and Electromagnetic Fields:**
- Some researchers propose neural excitation is associated with electromagnetic fields which might play a formative role in brain dynamics.
- Attention has been focused on biophotons as a basis for processing in the visual cortex due to quantum releases in mitochondrial redox reactions and microtubules.

**Ion Channels and Conformation Changes:**
- All excitable cells have ion channels which undergo conformation changes associated with voltage, orbital or ligand binding (internal factors like G-proteins), and neurotransmitters (acetylcholine).
- They also have osmotic and mechano-receptive activation through hearing and photoreception.
- Conformation changes of ion channels can exchange photons, phonons, mechano-osmotic effects, and orbital perturbations, representing a form of quantum synesthesia.

**Subjective Consciousness:**
- The relationship between subjective consciousness and the physical universe displays a similar complementarity with profound symmetry breaking.
- Subjective consciousness has a claim to cosmological status in relation to the physical universe as it may function to solve the problem of superabundance by reducing probability multiverses to the unique course of history.
- Biocentrism's conclusions are consistent with this view of consciousness in shaping the universe.

## 3. Does the Universe have Cosmological Memory Does This Imply Cosmic Consciousness
**Cosmic Consciousness and the Universe's Cosmological Memory**

**Introduction:**
- Discussion of cosmic consciousness: any system operating with memory and choice, including the universe
- Origins of idea in Maxwell's thought experiment (1867) about an intelligent creature violating Second Law of Thermodynamics (SLT)
- Overview of ongoing debate on SLT violation and various authors' approaches

**Background:**
- Definition of consciousness: macroscopic or microsopic system using memory and choice
- Maxwell's demon experiment: tiny intelligent creature separating hot from cold gases without external energy source
- Potential violation of Second Law of Thermodynamics (perpetual work without external energy)

**Arguments Against SLT Violation:**
- Thomson, Poincare, Planck et al. discussed the issue extensively
- Entropy equals loss of information; essential data added increases entropy (Lewis)
- Universe as a dimensional information structure (Davies, Lloyd)

**Approach in This Paper:**
- Preservation of SLT through relating it to memory and entropY
- Three assumptions: 1) SLT is the fundamental principle of space-time; 2) Memory plays a role in the universe's operation; 3) The universe has cosmological memory.

---

### Multiverse Model through Black Hole Dynamics and Thermodynamics
**Theories and Concepts**

**Second Law of Thermodynamics**:
- Applicable across all universes or multiverses
- Preservation required for thought experiments and physical systems

**Memory and Entropy**:
- Deeply related aspects
- System converting entropy to memory or vice versa with choice contributes intelligence/consciousness

**Multiverses**:
- Many proposed types based on cosmology, quantum mechanics, string theory, etc. (Carr 2007; Davies 2004b; Deutsch 1997; Linde 2008; Mersini-Houghton 2010 ; Rees 2001; Smolin 1997a; Tegmark 2004; Vass 2004b, 2005, 2008b, 2010; Vilenkin 2006)
- Need to select a model for developing cosmology based on observations and theoretical models

**Cosmological Model Proposed**:
- Incorporates a pair of universes separated by a \"cosmic gate\" (black hole)
- Black holes confirmed empirically through evidence (Rees 1989; Begleman et al. 1984; Casares 1992; Remillard 1992; Reynolds 2008)
- Distinct from Smolin's model, allowing for different fundamental constants or parameters in alternative universes (Smolin 1992a; Smolin 1997b)
- Resembles string theory's multiple dimensions argument for weak gravity (Susskind 2006; Horava and Witten 1996; Maartens and Koyama 2010)
- Places the Second Law of Thermodynamics as the prime mover, providing revitalized energy and matter back into our universe.

**Other Cosmological Scenarios**:
- Not related to Big Crunch scenario (Guth 2007) or chaotic inflation theory's bubble formation (Guth)

**Massive Particles in Black Holes**:
- Reduced to common fundamental particle with identical size, spin, and mass when passing through black hole into multiverse
- Gravity waves cause identical particles to repel each other.

---

### Perpetual Universes and Cosmic Creature-Driven Entropy Compensation
**Cosmological Model with String Gates**
- As massive and massless particles near or reach the speed of light, they enter a multiverse via a black hole
- A cosmic creature opens a \"string gate\" to allow fast moving particles to pass back into our universe
- This process reseeds our universe with new energy and fast moving particles
- Similar mechanism as virtual particles in particle physics collisions
- Virtual particles mediating force and momentum transfer during collisions are similar to the mechanism for observing particle speeds by cosmic creature
- Massive particles have longer de Broglie wavelengths when moving slower, while those close to the speed of light have shorter wavelengths
- Cosmic creature absorbs virtual particle and opens string gate for massive particle returning from multiverse
- Massless particles also return via cosmic string gates
- Decrease in entropy is balanced by increase in memory, preserving the Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Szilard's thought experiment on perpetual motion machine: entropy decrease can be compensated if accompanied by production of k ln2 units of entropy.

---

### Cosmological Consciousness and Virtual Particles in Coupled Universes
**Cosmological Consciousness and the Second Law of Thermodynamics**

**Minimal Condition for Cosmological Consciousness:**
- In coupled universes, existence of cosmological consciousness requires production of k ln2 units of entropy (equivalent to conscious memory and selection) to preserve Second Law of Thermodynamics.

**Brillouin's Argument:**
- An intelligent being cannot see molecules in a thermally isolated system without light or virtual particles.
- Virtual particles are not photons, but provide necessary information for the intelligent creature to operate on the system and maintain entropy balance.

**Characteristics of Virtual Particles:**
- All matter is discrete and countable.
- If virtual particles correspond to real numbers R instead of natural numbers N, an uncountably infinite number remains unabsorbed, enabling perpetual machine operation.

**Implications for the Second Law of Thermodynamics:**
- If the cosmological model presented exists: either Second Law is deeply flawed or invalid in certain domains or our universe is powered by cosmological consciousness.

**Conclusion:**
- The proposed model suggests that memory and choice, which imply cosmic awareness, are necessary to preserve the Second Law of Thermodynamics in a forever and infinite universe.

## 4. The Quantum Hologram And the Nature of Consciousness
**Quantum Hologram Model for Information Processing and Consciousness**

**Introduction:**
- Presenting new model called Quantum Hologram (QH) in nature
- QH might explain basis of consciousness
- Evidence suggests that it's a vast information storage and retrieval mechanism since ancient times

**Definition of Consciousness:**
1. Awareness or ability to perceive self and environment
2. Thoughts, sensations, emotions, dreams, awareness
3. Difficult to define but recognizable
4. East vs. West approach: Eastern traditions have a better handle on it than the Western tradition
5. Scientific community's recent interest in understanding consciousness
6. Issue with epiphenomenalism, which assumes consciousness is a byproduct of brain functions

8. Amoeba demonstrates purposeful behavior and awareness of environment
9. Viruses exhibit some aspects of consciousness or rudimentary form of awareness in their ability to manipulate host cells
10. Quantum phenomena, such as entanglement and non-locality, explain consciousness at the quantum level

**The Roots of Consciousness:**
11. Quantum events might be the most fundamental level of consciousness
12. Recent evidence suggests certain quantum phenomena operate at both macro and micro levels
13. Telepathic communication between twins or mother and child could be explained by these quantum phenomena.

---

### Quantum Foundations of Consciousness and Perception
**Quantum Phenomena and Consciousness Evolution**

**Quantum Group Effects and Psychic Phenomena**:
- Documented throughout recorded history
- Some demonstrated or suggested in recent laboratory experiments

**Consciousness Evolution**:
- Evolves as illustrated in Figure 1
- Lowest level: basic aspects of undifferentiated awareness built on quantum principles
- Higher levels: perception through molecular structures, non-local information exchange
- Plants use chemical and electro-magnetic means for perception

**Quantum Hologram Theory**:
- Proposed by Marcer (1997) to explain information exchange at fundamental level
- All life forms interconnected via quantum coherence

**Higher Levels of Perception and Awareness**:
- Required for spatial location, non-local quantum awareness effects also present
- Humans use more complex perception mechanisms as they evolve up the consciousness ladder

**Microtubules and Consciousness**:
- Penrose and Hameroff (1998) propose microtubules in brain cells could facilitate fundamental forms of perception
- Tubulin states governed by quantum mechanical effects, function as a quantum computer
- Quantum states prevent decoherence through the hollow microtubule structure

---

### Holographic Processing and Perception in Brains
**Holographic Processing in Brain**
- Brains store and process information holographically (in images contained within interference patterns)
- Holographic processing involves the brain acting as a phase conjugating device, which is a type of logic circuit sensitive to input signal phase
- Result is a virtual signal, a mirror image of quantum emissions (photons of light), creating detailed three dimensional movie and stream of consciousness
- Brain receives input signals resonating with similar virtual signals generated by the brain, setting up standing wave condition
- Input signal is the quantum emission spectrum of object being perceived
- Enables pattern classification and recognition through phase conjugate adaptive resonance (PCAR)

**Quantum Holography**
- Exibits distributive property: even small part contains entire holographic record with less resolution when reconstructed
- Living cells evolve from simple stem cells, implying quantum entanglement and instantaneous information exchange through PCAR
- Coherent laser beam used to correct atmospheric aberrations in telescopes is similar to PCAR process

**Implications for Perception**
- Brain perceives objects in three dimensions due to holographic processing, not just visible light reflected onto the retina (binocular vision)
- Survival advantage: accurately locates predators and food in three dimensional space.

---

### Quantum Holography Information Processing and Emission in Biological Systems
**Quantum Hologram and PCAR Process**

**PCAR Process**
- Illustration of: brain receives emissions from object, creates phase conjugate virtual waves, standing wave results allowing for object location in space
- Brain uses interference of two waves to create resonant condition for information processing
- Max Planck's theory of quantum emissions and coherence in complex matter
- Non-locality and instantaneous transmission of information across space and time

**Quantum Emissions and Non-Locality**
- Coherent emissions from complex matter (living organisms) exhibit quantum coherence
- Emissions carry information non-locally, affecting other objects in the environment
- Participatory universe: influence on everything we interact with

**Quantum Holography (QH)**
- Discovered attribute of all physical matter
- Validated by experimental work with functional magnetic resonating imaging (fMRI)
- Schempp's mathematical formalism expanding quantum information theory and improving MRI definition
- Postulate: biological entities have evolved as a massively parallel, learning computing system using the quantum hologram.

**Quantum Emissions and Amplitude/Phase Relationships**
- Carry information non-locally about event history of quantum states through EM waves of various frequencies
- Information contained in interference patterns similar to holographic plate
- Can store an incredible amount of information including entire space-time history.

---

### Quantum Hologram Nonlocal Information Storage and Resonance
**Quantum Hologram (QH)**

**Characteristics:**
- Nonlocal information storage in Zero Point Field (ZPF)
- Cannot be attenuated
- Resonance mechanism for accessing information
- Unique to every organism
- Three dimensional vista of an object's states
- Can be accessed by others through resonance

**Storage and Access:**
- Created from quantum emissions of atoms, molecules, and cells in an organism
- Each experience (objective and subjective) is stored in personal QH
- Identified by unique resonant frequencies or fingerprint
- Vista evolving in time, describing everything about the creating object
- Access through resonance with other objects or individuals

**Resonance:**
- Two identical objects vibrate in resonance when strings on each are plucked simultaneously at the same point and time
- Sound waves constructively interfere, producing greater amplitude standing wave
- Importance for accessing information stored in ZPF

**Brain Function:**
- Brain operates as a massively parallel quantum computer
- Sets up resonant condition with microtubules tuned to same frequency as standing waves in the ZPF
- Carries entire event history and reality of physical object or living organism in amplitude, frequencies (wavelengths), and phase relationships.

**Implications:**
- Information is recoverable through resonance with creating entity or other objects
- Not suggesting we are virtual beings living on a holographic plate but rather have a mechanism to describe how mind manipulates matter.

**Quantum Hologram Model: Overview**
- Description of reality model, based on quantum holography (QH)
- Explanation for various phenomena and information transfer between objects
- Fundamental role in understanding consciousness and self-organizing system
- Evidence from experiments and anecdotal evidence

**Background**
- Discovery of quantum holography as a real phenomenon

### Developmental Field Theory and Morphic Resonance
**How DNA and Environment Influence Cell Development**

**Cells and Genetic Blueprint**:
- Every cell contains same genetic blueprint of DNA
- Cells function and maintain homeostasis by communicating with other cells and the environment
- Intercellular signaling is electrochemical in nature, but mechanisms are still being studied

**Epigenetics and Environmental Influences**:
- Evidence shows organisms acquire characteristics from their environment through epigenetic inheritance
- Epigenetics studies the mechanisms by which the environment influences cells without changing genetic codes
- Forcing scientists to reconsider evolutionary theory, harkening back to Lamarckian evolution

**Intercellular Communication in Embryonic Development**:
- Cells divide thousands of times during embryonic development to produce identical stem cells
- Cells then differentiate into specialized tissues and organs of the body
- Intercellular communication is critical, but not sufficient to explain full development of an organism

**The Hypothesis of Morphic Causation**:
- Proposed theory by Sheldrake explaining how the structure and form (morphology) of an organism develops
- Developing organisms are shaped by fields that contain the form and shape of the organism
- Each species has its own information field, with nested fields within individual organisms
- The morphic field contains cumulative memory based on what has happened to the species in the past
- Applies not only to living organisms but also to proteins, crystals, even atoms
- Morphic field includes fields of both form and behavior

### Experimental Evidence for Non-Locality in Consciousness
**Akashic Record and Quantum Holagram (QH)**

**The Akashic Record**:
- Developed in Sanskrit and ancient Indian culture
- Described as an all-pervasive foundation containing knowledge of human experience and the entire history of the universe
- Normal five senses cannot access this information, but can be accessed through spiritual practices like meditation

**Similarities to Quantum Holagram (QH) Theory**:
- Laszlo's A-field theory contains similar concepts as described in QH
- Implies a mechanism for accessing transcendent information via resonance

**Resonance and the Quantum Holagram (QH)**
- The primary means of accessing transcendent information is through resonance
- Massively parallel processing capabilities of the brain can resonate with QH information at various frequencies
- Figure 4 shows the resonance spectrum, ranging from simple phenomena like entanglement to more complex phenomena like out-of-body experiences (OBEs) and reincarnation

**Interpretation of Events and Beliefs**:
- All events are subject to interpretation based on prior experience and knowledge
- Changing beliefs, especially when not based on knowledge but faith, can be problematic
- Example: Thunder and lightning were once attributed to evil spirits rather than natural electrostatic discharges

**Experimental Evidence for Non-locality**:
- Experiments testing non-locality have yielded mixed results, some controversial
- Meta-analysis by Radin (1997) and Utts (1991) demonstrated compelling statistics supporting the perception of non-local information
- Failure to replicate experiments does not prove the phenomenon is missing but rather that a hidden mechanism may be operating

**Experimenter Bias**:
- Experimenter or participant's expectations, beliefs, and preconceptions can bias experimental results, even in double-blind experiments
- Classical science has not provided a theoretical structure to support non-local information perception, leading to anomalous results being dismissed as faulty or fraudulent

---

### Non-Local Correlations and Mind-Matter Interactions Evidence for Quantum Holographic Perception
**Radin's Findings on Psychic Phenomena and Random Number Generators (RNGs)**
- Radin's experiments in late 20th century: more correlations than chance in various psychic phenomena studies
- Meta-analysis of RNG studies subjected to psycho-kinesis (PK) intention resulted in odds against chance of 35 trillion to one over the entire database
- Decade-long experiments by Dunne and Jahn at Princeton University provided overwhelming evidence of statistically skewed results in mechanical processes driven by random processes
- Ganzfeld meta-analysis demonstrated results with odds against chance of 29 x 10^18 (1 in 29,000,000,000,000,000,000)
- Other studies showing similar results

**Audience Effect on RNGs and Emotional Content**
- Radin discovered audiences skewed output of computer random number generators during high emotional content performances
- Results from O.J. Simpson murder trial broadcast recorded significant correlation with emotional peaks and audience numbers
- Similar effect observed during 9/11 World Trade Center disaster coverage

**Thesis: Participatory Universe, Not Pure Objectivity**
- Princeton experiments suggest participant intentionality creates non-random effects
- Radin's experiments not driven by intentionality but rapt attention drives system away from randomness towards greater order
- Results suggest attention and intention provide closely correlated outcomes; randomness may not be a property of nature

**Non-local Effects at a Distance**
- Mind-to-mind or mind-to-object experiments conducted for decades, often dismissed by mainstream science due to foreign implications
- Condition of resonance necessary (PCAR) for non-local effects; perceiver's system entrained in phase locked resonant feedback loop
- Two-way street: action on object affects perception and vice versa

**Human Abilities Beyond Local Information**
- Humans can perceive, recognize, and give meaning to non-local information across a broad range of complexity (animals, humans)
- Quantum holographic theory provides an adequate informational structure for observed results
- Meditation enhances understanding about objects through focused attention and deeper levels.

---

### Resonance and Non-Local Information with Icons
**Establishing Resonance through Focused Attention (PCAR)**
- The action of focusing attention by a percipient is necessary for resonance to be established with a perceived object (PCAR)
- For people with handicaps, reducing stress, eliminating distractions, and quieting the mind can improve one's ability to focus and improve the resonance condition
- Healers report that focusing attention creates a resonance with the object of their healing activities
- They often sense a picture or holographic image of the perceived object, which may appear different from healthy tissue
- Healers claim they can focus energy or manipulate (e.g., intentionally) diseased tissue, causing it to take on the same characteristics as healthy tissue over time
- This may be the result of the healer's intent resonating with the quantum emissions and absorptions by the diseased tissues

**Resonance in Healing Prayer**
- Healers and other psychically sensitive individuals often enter into resonance (PCAR) with the object of their focused attention or intention
- They may use an icon, such as an image, picture, representation, or article associated with the target, to facilitate this resonant process
- Icons can provide a mechanism for the intender to tune in or resonate with the target
- Touching an icon appears to satisfy the resonance (PCAR) requirement and allows the intender access to information about the target that is not available from normal space-time information
- Police agencies use this modality with psychics, who often have success in gaining nonlocal information through focused attention
- Healers and people praying may also utilize icons to facilitate resonant healing through focused intentionality

**Nonlocal Information and Water Memory in Homeopathy**
- Molecules of toxic substances can resonate with emitted photons from an original solution, and water molecules containing these emissions can later resonate with the human immune system when absorbed by it
- If an icon has been in contact with an individual or contains their signature, the event history of the icon and that of the target intersect
- The phase relationships of quantum emissions from the icon contain a record of the target object's journey in three-dimensional space and time, as well as its quantum states
- Sensitive individuals can decode the information coded in these phase relations to perceive nonlocal holographic information associated with the target

**Conscious Perception vs. Nonlocal Holographic Information**
- Humans do not routinely bring nonlocal information into conscious awareness when operating in ordinary three-dimensional reality
- Perception is based on space-time information, such as shape, color, and function, rather than the additional nonlocal information (e.g., location, threats)
- Intuitive perceptions may be suppressed due to language development, cultural conditioning, and lack of practice

### Quantum Holographic Information Retrieval Reincarnation Out-of-Body Experiences and Remote Viewing
**Cultural Conditioning and Reincarnation Experiences**

**Dr. Ian Stevenson's Research**:
- Investigated children who claimed to have lived previous lives
- Children often displayed unusual behaviors or phobias unexplained by current life events
- Child's statements corresponded accurately with facts of a deceased person's life and death
- Families had no prior contact with the child before the experience occurred

**Proposed Explanation**:
- Reincarnation event is a real, non-local event experienced by the child
- However, interpretation of the event is not always correct
- Person may be in a high state of resonance with the quantum hologram (QH) of the deceased
- Child can retrieve information about the deceased from this resonant condition
- As the child ages and rational left brain processing dominates, they lose ability to maintain altered consciousness state
- Similar effect seen with out-of-body experiences (OBEs)
- Represents high state of resonance with remote location or object's QH

**Meditation Practices and Altered States**:
- Meditators, mystics, and natural psychics can access non-local information through meditation
- Experience altered sense of space-time, dissolution of self, and unified awareness
- Feel intense bliss and clarity of mind
- Postulated to enter high resonance state with QH, allowing access to all implied information by unity

**Left Brain vs. Right Brain Processing**:
- Academic interest in left brain rational processing rather than right brain intuitive functions
- Learning recall of intuitive, creative processes involves enhanced coordination between hemispheres and QH
- Differs from left brain function of extending/extrapolating factual data to intuitively conclude without intermediary steps

**Remote Viewing (RV)**:
- Ability to experience activities and events not accessible by normal senses
- Extensively researched at Stanford Research Institute in the 1970s, funded by CIA for 20 years
- Involved establishing resonance with target without classical space-time information
- Perceived information is internal and must be associated with the perceiver's experience to recognize the target
- Complex targets require considerable training, teamwork, and experience to extract nonlocal information reliably.

---

### Quantum Holography and Remote Perception in Natures Learning Process
**Remote Viewing and Quantum Holography**

**Experience of Perception**:
- Information received through remote viewing is sketchy, often dream-like or subtle
- Skilled individuals may report information as vivid, clear, and unambiguous
- Remote viewing information lacks space-time component from normal senses to fully identify the object

**Enhancing Remote Viewing Skill**:
- Training can enhance remote viewing skill and accuracy
- Associated neural circuitry becomes more robust with increased training and acceptance

**Role of Resonance in Perception**:
- Lack of normal sensory signals leads to an icon representing the object to establish resonance condition (PCAR)
- A reference signal is required for decoding encoded holographic phase-dependent information

**Experiments on Resonance and Healing**:
- De La Warr's experiments in the 1940s and 1950s on remote diagnosis and healing with his wife, a psychic healer
- Focused attention on target object could establish resonant condition between target and measuring device
- Able to project resonance condition and expose photographic plate, revealing spatial encoding similar to fMRI scans

**Summary of Quantum Holography Model**:
- Perception occurs through establishing resonance (PCAR) between percipient and target object
- Reciprocal relationship: Object's history recorded in its quantum hologram affects the interference pattern, which can be detected
- Resonance allows evaluation by percipient, leading to cognition, meaning assignment, belief, and experience.

### Quantum Holography A Universe of Interconnected Information and Creative Self-Organization
**Understanding Non-Locality in Nature: Implications for Consciousness and the Universe**

**Introduction:**
- Request to summarize quantum holography and its implications in two pages
- Difficult task due to nature's complexity
- Importance of understanding our place in the universe and developing a new worldview that addresses relationship with self, others, environment, and cosmos

**Nature's Principles:**
1. Self-organizing: All matter emerges from complex adaptations and evolutions in response to environmental changes.
2. Intelligent: Universe utilizes information, processes it, and assigns meaning based on feedback mechanisms.
3. Creative: Interconnected systems regulate and organize themselves with purposeful behavior through trial and error.
4. Interactive: All matter continually interacts, defining relationships rather than independent actions.
5. Learning: Experience is retained in nature's memory, the Quantum Hologram.
6. Participatory: Intention in conscious matter has demonstrable effects.
7. Evolving: Nature develops increasing complexity through natural processes and environmental changes.
8. Non-locally connected: Instantaneous information exchange between objects occurs regardless of space-time separation.
9. Quantum principles: All matter displays quantum characteristics such as entanglement, coherence, correlation, and resonance from micro to macro scales.

---

### Natures Self-Reference and Evolution A Bootstrap Process
**Hypothesis of Universe as a Living, Evolving System:**
- The universe is a living, evolving system that utilizes information to organize itself and create complexity (Figure 6)
- We are interconnected with the universe and cannot be separated from it
- Nature learns through habit formation and adaptation by trial and error
- Humankind has evolved to question fundamental nature and influence its evolution

**Support for Hypothesis:**
- Ancient sages, avatars, mystics, spiritual leaders, shamans have proposed similar hypotheses throughout history
- Modern man must evolve to the next level of sophistication and refinement
- Change, adaptation, and evolution are nature's intrinsic mandate
- All creation must perish or constantly evolve; arrow of time flows in one direction only

**Theory as a Model:**
- The hypothesis presented is a map or model of reality based on observational evidence and known properties of nature
- Cornerstones are built upon verified properties and processes, subject to testing, modification, revision, or discarding if necessary
- Encourages discussion and research for enhancing understanding and survival of all life on earth.

**Importance of Understanding:**
- Democracy requires an informed electorate to thrive and prosper
- Sound bites, personal biases, self-serving interests have no place in learning and discovery
- Openness, willingness to be informed, and engagement in new knowledge essential for survival.

## 5. How Consciousness Becomes the Physical Universe
**Title:** Integrating Consciousness in the Physical Universe: A Theory

**Introduction**:
- The title is provocative, aiming to provide a theory of how the physical universe and conscious observers can be integrated
- Traditionally, consciousness has been excluded from science due to two grounds: it has no effect on experimental data or considered subjective and unreliable for scientific method
- Our challenge is to include consciousness within the methods of science
- Starting point: Physics, recognizes three broad approaches: classical, relativistic, and quantum

**Classical Physics**:
- Suitable for most everyday applications
- Epistemology limited, does not apply at microscopic level or cosmic processes

**Quantum Theory vs. General Relativity**:
- Goal of unifying general relativity with quantum theory still unreached
- Quantum theory opens the door to the issue of consciousness in measurement process
- Early founders of quantum mechanics held that the participatory role of observation is fundamental and underlying substance is processes, not constant material substance

**Challenges**:
- Uncertainty over how to define consciousness

---

### Quantum Reality Mindful Observation and Non-locality
**Subject-Object Dichotomy and Consciousness**
- Objective science is based on subject-object dichotomy
- Scientists reluctant to address consciousness as primary
- Subjective reality may be primary, not an epiphenomenon of physical processes
- Conscious observer plays a crucial role in observation

**Quantum Theory and Observer Participation**
- **Copenhagen Interpretation (CI)**: Reality cannot be disentangled from act of observation
- Observations play a critical role at every level
- Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: Atom has no immediate physical properties
- Non-locality and undivided reality are basic facts of nature
- Mindful acts of observation play crucial role in quantum phenomena

**Practice vs. Theory in Quantum Mechanics**
- Gap between practice (following CI) and underlying theory
- Consequences for the nature of reality are far-reaching

**Non-locality and Undivided Reality**
- Implied by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment
- Explicitly formulated in Bell's Theorem and relationship to EPR
- Evidence from numerous quantum phenomena, including Aharonov-Bohm effect
- Mindful acts of observation play a crucial role at every level

**Original CI: Pragmatic Approach**
- Not about revealing the true essence of phenomena
- Concerned with epistemology (how we experience quantum phenomena)
- Left aside ontological questions about the ultimate nature of reality

**Extensions to Original CI**
- **John von Neumann's processes**: Acquisition of knowledge, mathematical formalism, statistical choices prescribed by QM, free choice on part of observer
- This selection process cannot be described by QM or any physically described part of reality
- Yields a profoundly different way of looking at the physical universe and our role in it.

---

### Quantum Mechanics and the Brain Connecting Micro- to Macroscale Processes
**Quantum Theory and Observer's Role**
- Quantum theory today includes observer's free choices and nature's choices in determining actual outcomes
- The \"dance\" between observer and nature reflects the concept of the participatory role of the observer
- Bohr emphasized that freedom of experimentation allows for the expression of free will on the part of the observer
- Nature responds statistically as described by quantum formalism
- Extended arguments are given for metaphysically-based views of nature based on quantum mechanics

**Quantum Mechanics and the Brain**
- It is essential to avoid assuming that the physical universe is rooted in the physical brain alone
- The brain must acquire quantum status like other atomic structures it comprises
- Some scientists accept the applicability of quantum mechanics at some scales in the brain, such as microtubules in neurophysiological relevant scales
- Complementarity or quantum-like effects may be operating in brain processes, such as motor function and cognitive activities
- Quantum formalism may be introduced for brain dynamics to account for global relationships and extreme efficiency of biological systems

**Challenges and Debates**
- Arguments against relevant quantum processes in the brain often center around decoherence, where collapse of wave functions bring a quantum system into relationship with macroscale objects
- Decoherence arguments assume thermal equilibrium, which is not typically the case for bio-molecular dynamics
- Quantum states can be \"pumped\" like a laser and ions within ion channels do not move freely, leading to potential protection of quantum coherence
- High-resolution atomic X-ray spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that molecular organization in ion channels allows for pre-organized correlations or ion trappings within the selectivity filter.

---

### Quantum Consciousness A Unified Model for Reality
**Quantum Entanglement in Biological Systems**
- Evidence for quantum coherence in biological systems at high temperatures
- Proteins supporting photosynthesis: conversion of solar photons to quantum electron states that propagate through protein via all possible paths
- New quantum ideas and laboratory evidence applicable to fields of molecular cell biology and biophysics will have profound impact on modeling and understanding coherence in neuro-molecular systems

**Bridging the Gap: A Consciousness Model**
- Purpose is not to settle technical issues or address many questions raised as scientists link quantum processes to biology
- Primary goal: to propose a reliable model against which experiments can be challenged
- No strictly mechanistic, physical foundation for the cosmos exists
- The source of reality must be self-sufficient, capable of generating complex systems on micro and macro scales, self-regulating, and holistic
- Consciousness fits this description as it is inseparable from cognition, perception, observation, and measurement
- Uncreated source must turn into the physical universe, not simply oversee it
- Consciousness includes human observers, part of a feedback loop that links conscious acts to the response of the field
- Universe presents the face we are looking for; when we look for a different face, the universe changes its mask
- Consciousness is characterized by generalized principles of complementarity, non-locality, scale-invariance, and undivided wholeness
- Existing outside space and time, consciousness predates these concepts
- Unifying approach: all can be traced back to the same source; physics can serve as a pivotal role in transitioning to new model
- Materialism's claim that consciousness arises from physical systems leads to a paradox and cannot be proven objectively
- Future development of science will retain the objectivity of present-day science but address consciousness from the inside rather than trying to devise a theory of everything on the outside.

## 6. Conscious States Are a Crosstalk Mechanism for Only a Subset of Brain Processes
**Conscious States and Unconscious Processes**

**Introduction:**
- Consensus that conscious states are associated with a subset of sophisticated processes in the nervous system
- Conscious state defined as basic awareness, sentience, or phenomenal experience (Nagel, 1974)
- Many functions carried out unconsciously: low-level perceptual processing and motor control
- Question: What do conscious states contribute to nervous function?

**Isolating Conscious Processes:**
1. Low-level perceptual analysis and integration within/across modalities occur unconsciously, such as binding shapes and colors (Zeki & Bartels, 1999).
2. Semantic processing is largely unconscious: speaker activates meaning of \"cat\" unconsciously when naming it (Levelt, 1989).
3. Action plans can be activated, selected, and expressed unconsciously through neurological disorders like blindsight (Weiskrantz, 1997).
4. Unconscious actions: pupillary reflex, reflexive pain withdrawal, subliminal stimuli responses.
5. Neurological cases: patients report being blind but still exhibit visually guided behaviors despite consciousness being spared.

**Conscious Processes Associated with Conscious States:**
- Not clear yet what specific cognitive/brain processes are most intimately associated with conscious states.

---

### Conscious States Required for Skeletal Muscle Conflicts
**Unconscious Processes and Conscious States**

**Complex Unconscious Actions:**
- Alien hand syndrome (Bryon & Jedynak, 1972)
- Archic hand syndrome (Marchetti & Della Sala, 1998)
- Utilization behavior syndrome (Lhermitte, 1983)
- Dissociation between action and conscious perception: Patient D.F. (Goodale & Milner, 2004)

**Characteristics of Unconscious Processes:**
- Relatively complex goal-directed behavior
- Maladaptive or at odds with reported intentions
- No conscious integration

**Conscious States and Integration:**
- Provide internal communication for neural activities (Morsella, 2005)
- Integrate diverse sources of information/processes
- Allows adaptive action to emerge

**Unconscious Interactions:**
1. Perceptual processes within a sensory modality and between different modalities
2. Perceptual and motor processes: unconscious eference binding (Morsella & Bargh, 2011)
3. Control of smooth muscle effects, as in the case of consensual processes in the pupillary reflex (Bartley, 1942; Morsella et al., 2009)
4. Motor control (Grossberg, 1999; Jeannerod, 2006; Rosenbaum, 2002)
5. Unconscious interactions between different forms of crosstalk in the nervous system (Figure 1)

**Conscious States vs. Unconscious Interactions:**
- Not about complexity, controllability, feedback properties, degree of memory required, or top-down processes
- Distinguished by nature of effects involved: conflicting tendencies toward skeletal muscle output system (Morsella, 2005)

**Conscious Conflicts:**
- Holding breath or suppressing pain withdrawal reflexes
- Simultaneous activation of two streams of eference binding, leading to integrated actions (Figure 2)

**Subjective Effects of Conflicts from Action Conflicts:**
- Conscious states are necessary for intersensory conflicts, smooth muscle conflicts, and skeletomotor unintegrated actions don't have subjective effects.

---

### Consciousness Multidetermined Brain Interaction for Adaptive Action Selection
**Multidetermination in Action Selection and Consciousness**
- Challenge: Multiple brain regions have conflicting intentions for skeletomotor output
- Conscious states solve this challenge by allowing communication between different systems to yield adaptive action
- Skeletal muscle system can be thought of as a \"big steering wheel\" controlled by multiple brain regions
- When these regions are in conflict, conscious experience is strong (e.g., holding breath)
- Consciousness functions like a \"wifi system\" to integrate different processes in the brain and yield adaptive action

**Isolating Neural Substrates of Conscious States**
- Eliminative approach attempted to isolate conscious states by identifying operations that cannot occur unconsciously
- Evidence for conscious states: interregional synchrony, binocular rivalry, and modes of interaction between brain regions are important
- Unconscious processes involve fewer brain regions than conscious counterparts
- Consciousness linked to ventral processing stream, but not necessary for action execution
- Thalamocortical interaction or resonance proposed as a mechanism, but inconsistent with olfactory consciousness
- Prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex involved in conscious aspects of odor discrimination
- Consciousness does not require non-dominant cerebral cortex or commissures
- Absence of spinal cord, cerebellum, amygdalae, or hippocampi does not eradicate basic conscious state

**Cortical-Subcortical Controversy**
- Penfield and Jasper proposed consciousness as a function of subcortical structures
- Recent experiments suggest awareness of actions occurs in sensorium with motor processes being unconscious
- Future research may evaluate the necessary role of parietal areas in generating basic consciousness.

## 7. The Neuroanatomy of Free Will Loss of Will Against the Will Alien Hand
**Neuroanatomy of Free Will**

**Description:**
- Frontal lobes mediate free will
- Detailed discussion with case histories
- Impacts decision making, goal formation, attention, memory storage and retrieval
- Involvement in behavior control through SMA and medial regions

**Keywords:** Consciousness, Free Will, Frontal Lobes, Medial Frontal Lobes, Supplementary Motor Area (SMA)

**Functional Localization:**
- Damage to specific brain regions impacts consciousness, including free will
- Frontal lobes particularly affected by injury or damage
- Broca's aphasia: left frontal lobe damage affects speech but not will to speak or sing
- Free will abolished with widespread damage to left medial anterior cerebral hemispheres

**Disconnection Syndrome:**
- No isolated brain function without connections to other areas
- Broca's area: subserves capacity to speak
- Grammatical and denotative aspects of language organized in IPL adjacent to Wernickes receptive language area
- Arcuate fasciculus connects IPL, Broca's, and Wernicke's areas
- Damage to arcuate fasciculus results in severe word finding difficulty.

---

### Right Frontal Lobe Unrestrained Free Will
**Consciousness, Forebrain, and Free Will**

**Disconnection of Different Parts of the Mind**:
- The will to speak remains intact (due to preservation of frontal language areas)
- Missing words are locked away in posterior regions of the forebrain

**Locked-in Syndrome**:
- Due to destruction of pyramidal nerve fiber pathways linking brainstem pontine area with the forebrain
- Patients appear fully conscious and maintain will to move/speak, but cannot physically do so (except blinking)
- Forebrain remains intact and functional with only mild reductions in cerebral metabolism

**Jean-Dominique Bauby's Case**:
- Suffered stroke damaging neural pathways between frontal lobes and brainstem
- Initially believed to be vegetative, but was conscious and able to communicate by blinking code for letters
- Dictated memoir \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\" before dying of pneumonia

**Consciousness in Locked-in Syndrome**:
- Forebrain remains intact, including frontal lobes
- Patients can still make choices and act on them if free will is defined as ability to plan, consider alternatives, and act
- Free will localized to frontal lobes, especially medial areas

**Frontal Lobe Functions**:
- Serve myriad functions including memory, attention, perception, emotion, body image, and consciousness
- Damage to different brain areas can limit free will depending on the extent of damage

**Right Frontal Lobe Injuries**:
- May result in disinhibition, saying/doing whatever comes to mind without concern for others or consequences
- Patients may behave aggressively, impulsively, and irresponsibly

---

### Behavioral and Motor Changes Following Frontal Lobe Injuries
**Patient Behavior and Frontal Lobe Injuries**

**Singling out Patients:**
- Man with tumor in right frontal area: threw patient's radio out, sang loudly, acted impulsively (Joseph 1986a, 1988a, 1999b)
- D.F.: attempted suicide, laughed ridiculously, dressed inappropriately, lost control over behavior (Joseph 1988a)
- Man with right frontal injury: excessive talking, restlessness, disinhibited, sexually preoccupied, spent money recklessly (Joseph 1996)
- Woman with right frontal tumor: walked around naked, claimed to be wealthy and royalty (Joseph 1996)
- Man with seizure activity in right frontal lobe: compelled to masturbate publicly, exposed himself (Joseph 1996)
- Engineer with right frontal injury: sexually indiscriminate, spent money lavishly, delusions of grandeur (Joseph 1986a, 1996)

**Common Symptoms:**
- Periods of tangentiality, grandiosity, irresponsibility, laziness, hyperexcitability, promiscuity, silliness, childishness, lability, personal untidiness and dirtiness, poor judgment, irritability, fatuous jocularity (Fuster 1997; Joseph 1986a, 1988a, 1999b; Miller & Cummings 2006; Passingham, 1997; Risber g & Grafman 2006)
- Unconcern about consequences, tactlessness, changes in sex drive and hunger (Fuster 1997; Joseph 1986a, 1988a, 1999b; Miller & Cummings 2006; Passingham, 1997; Risber g & Grafman 2006)
- Patients not acting according to their free will but often against it (Joseph 1986a, 1988a, 1999b)

**Motor Control and Movement:**
- Free will requires access to and control over motor systems of the brain and body musculature (Fuster 1997; Joseph 1986a, 1988a, 1999a; Miller & Cummings 2006; Passingham, 1997; Risber g & Grafman 2006)
- Motor control and movement controlled by primary, secondary, and supplementary motor areas in the neocortex (Fuster 1997; Joseph 1986a, 1988a, 1999a; Miller & Cummings 2006; Passingham, 1997; Risber g & Grafman 2006)
- One-to-one correspondence between single neurons in primary motor area and muscles (Chouinard & Paus 2006; Dum & Strick 2005; Verstynen, et al. 2011)

**Nerve Fiber Pathways:**
- Primary motor areas control fine motor functioning (typing or writing)
- Representation of musculature more diffuse in secondary premotor area
- Premotor transmits motor impulses to primary motor areas and subcortical regions, receives orders from supplementary motor area (Joseph 1999b; Nachev et al. )

---

### Executive Control Over Motor Movements and Free Will Disruption after Medial Frontal Lobe Damage
**Medial Frontal Lobe and Supplementary Motor Area (SMA)**
- The SMA is more concerned with guiding movements of extremities through space
- It programs and exercises executive control over primary and secondary motor areas
- Activity begins in the SMA before movements are initiated, especially when anticipating or preparing to move
- The SMA exerts executive control over arms and hands to direct them towards items of interest
- Direct electrical stimulation of the SMA can trigger complex semipurposeful movements

**Disconnection Between SMA/Medial Frontal Lobes and Motor Areas**
- If neural pathways are severed, the disconnected primary and secondary motor areas may act against the patient's will
- Behavior is controlled deterministically by external stimuli
- Patients involuntarily engage in complex coordinated movements, such as grasping objects they don't want to use
- Object presence can trigger compulsive object manipulation and loss of control over limbs
- Patients may be unable to release grip on objects once taken hold of
- Gegenhalthen (counterpull), i.e. involuntary resistance to movement, is associated with medial frontal lobe/SMA abnormalities.

---

### Alien Hand Syndrome Two Consciousnesses One Body
**Alien Hand Syndrome**
- Condition where patient's hand moves involuntarily, against their will
- Result of damage or disconnection to:
  - Medial frontal lobes
  - SupraMotor Area (SMA)
  - Connections between motor areas
- Patients report embarrassment and frustration

**Symptoms**
- Hand becomes rigid and patients forced to maintain it in place
- Slow return to resting position, referred to as \"waxy flexibility\"
- Compulsive reaching for objects
- Attempts to restrain alien hand using other limbs or tricking it with new objects
- Inability to control behavior of the affected hand

**Alien Consciousness**
- Damage to medial frontal lobes and anterior corpus callosum can result in two separate consciousnesses
  - One that directs alien behaviors through the alien hand
  - Another that is aware but unable to oppose these behaviors

**Examples of Alien Hand Behaviors**
- Reaching out and touching female breasts or other inappropriate objects
- Unable to release objects once grasped
- Speaking private thoughts aloud against will
- Left hand attempting to restrain alien right hand
- Difficulty with bimanual activities (opposing actions)

**Effect on Patients**
- Embarrassment and frustration due to loss of control over body
- Inability to perform normal tasks or daily activities
- Increased irritation, depression, and embarrassment.

---

### Alien Hand Syndrome Autonomous and Opposing Behavior Post-Split Brain Surgery
**Split-Brain Patients and Alien Hand Syndrome**

**Difficulties with Decision Making**:
- Similar difficulties in decision making plague both those who have undergone split-brain surgery and those who have not.
- A recently divorced patient reported being forced to go a different direction by his left body half, while the right body half resisted.
- Another patient expressed anger toward an ex-girlfriend and intended to never see her again, but both thumbs were giving different responses.
- A patient's left hand struck his wife, causing embarrassment for the right (speaking) hemisphere.

**Intermanual Conflict**:
- Almost all complete commissurotomy patients manifested some degree of intermanual conflict in the early postoperative period.
- Patients described their hands being uncooperative or engaging in \"battles of the wills\".
- One patient's left hand attempted to choke himself and had to be wrestled away.

**Mirror Neurons**:
- Mirror neurons are densely concentrated in the **supplementary motor area (SMA)**, which is implicated in the expression of all alien actions.
- Mirror neurons allow individuals to recognize motor actions made by others and perform/mimic them, enabling interpersonal communication.

**Free Will and Alien Behaviors**:
- In 1988, it was demonstrated that these alien behaviors are purposeful, goal-directed, and under the control of a free will separate from the dominant stream of consciousness with access to language.
- Patients were tested by having both hands experience different materials, but correctly pointing to the experienced material.
- The left \"alien\" hand did not mimic or interfere with the choices made by the right hand and had its own free will.
- Patients became angry when their \"alien\" left hand chose differently from what they expected, leading to conflict between the two hands.

---

### Neurological Basis of Free Will and Catatonia
**Frontal Lobes and Free Will**

**Function of Frontal Lobes:**
- Executive region of the brain responsible for personality, cognitive processes, decision making, goal formation, attention, concentration, and memory retrieval
- Neuroanatomical substrate for free will is located in the SMA (Supplementary Motor Area) and MFL (Medial Frontal Lobes)

**Impact of Injuries:**
- Disconnection from SMA/MFL leads to compulsive behaviors, difficulty moving or speaking, and catatonia
  - Patients may feel compelled to act against their will
  - Destruction of MFL abolishes free will, leaving thoughts and ideas absent
  - Catatonic patients remain in uncomfortable positions for long periods with no reason to move or function
- Recovery may result in patients remarking loss of will to speak, generate ideas, and even live.

**Free Will:**
- Localized to the frontal lobes, especially SMA and medial regions
- Decision making, goal formation, and behavior control
- Two independent streams of mental activity following their own free will after surgical destruction or disconnection of neural pathways from SMA and medial frontal lobes.

**Compulsive Behaviors:**
- Patients may experience unwanted repetitive actions like hand washing or shouting inappropriate remarks due to abnormalities in deep medial frontal lobe structures.
- Tourette's syndrome patients exhibit spontaneous movements and involuntary utterances, possibly linked to damage in neural pathways to/from the medial frontal lobes.
- Suppression or inhibition of thoughts and behaviors may be difficult following damage to the medial frontal lobes and supplementary motor areas.

## 8. Brain Consciousness and Causality
**Epiphenomenalism and Consciousness:** An Examination of Theory and Empirical Perspectives

**Introduction:**
- Fundamental question: role of consciousness in human life
- Common sense assumption: consciousness influences behavior
- Epiphenomenalism: controversial view excluding conscious processes from scientific accounts
- Origins of epiphenomenalism: Huxley's comparison of consciousness to a steam whistle
- Ancient Greek philosophy vs. Modern Age concepts of mind and body

**Background:**
- Philosophical debate on mental causation
- Epiphenomenalists: explain origins of consciousness as an irrelevant byproduct
- Similarities to ancient philosophies: Aristotle, Stoics, Plato, Pythagoreans, and Descartes
- Modern form set by Descartes

**Epiphenomenalism:**
- Definition: mental properties are superfluous byproducts of brain processes
- Comparison with mirrors or shadows
- Huxley's influence: perplexed by function of consciousness, assumed no role in behavior
- Biological continuity argument for no differences between animal and human consciousness

**Modern Debate:**
- Contemporary philosophers and neuroscientists holding epiphenomenalist views
- Importance of understanding epiphenomenalism: potential implications for scientific research on consciousness.

---

### Epiphenomenalism and Causality A Reexamination
**Epiphenomenalism and Radical Behaviorism**
- **Burrhus Skinner's radical behaviorism**: supports the idea that mental terms can be paraphrased or eliminated, only physical/behavioral terms should be used for explanation
- Similar to epiphenomenalism in denying the reality of consciousness
- Consciousness seen as a nonphysical illusion with no influence on behavior

**Critique of Epiphenomenalism**
- Counterintuitive to consider conscious will as having no influence on physical world
- **Bottom-up causality**: only physical level determines behavior, conscious mind cannot interact with the physical world
- Problems with defining and including non-causal mental phenomena in ontology
- Difficulty distinguishing between causal and non-causal physical events
- Conceptual difficulties and implications of maintaining a division between causal and non-causal physical events

**Epiphenomenalism vs. Physical Causal Closure**
- The principle of **physical causal closure**: if a physical event has a cause, it has a physical cause
- Epiphenomenalism requires an **exclusion principle**: if an event e has a sufficient cause c at time t, no event distinct from c can be the cause of e. However, this is ruled out when the principle of exclusion and physical causal closure are joined together, as it only allows physical events to cause other physical events.

---

### Consciousness and Quantum Physics Implications for Epiphenomenalism
**Epiphenomenalism and Quantum Physics Argument:**
- Epiphenomenalism: two principles not strictly against folk psychology's belief in conscious mind in every human being
- Assumptions consistent with psycho-physical parallelism, where distinct domains of conscious mental events may coincide with specific physical phenomena
- Denied that consciousness can causally interact with physical phenomena
- Causal explanations must be expressed as chains of purely physical events
- Argument from quantum physics: role of observer's consciousness in wave function collapse
  - Copenhagen interpretation (Heisenberg, von Neumann, London & Bauer)
    - Key role for observer in the collapse of wave function
    - Different interpretations of consciousness and its role
      - Heisenberg: conscious intervention in measurement process
      - Bohr: context-dependent status of physical observations
        * Not referring to conscious intervention but subjective character of quantum phenomena
  - Challenge to epiphenomenalism if consciousness can bring about wave function collapse
    * Consciousness should be nonphysical entity if it causes collapse without being described by Schrdinger equation
- Difficulty in reconciling consciousness with physical world if it has causal power.

### Consciousness as Necessary Result of Cerebral Processes A Review on Epiphenomenalism
**Theory of Consciousness by Edelman**

**Two Selective Processes for Primary and Secondary Representation of Repertoire:**
- Structural diversity created through differential reproduction: primary repertoire
- Postnatal behavioral experience with epigenetic modifications: secondary repertoire

**Edelman's Theory on Human Consciousness:**
1. Dependent on complex physiology of the human brain
2. Arises from parallel re-entrant connections between individual cells and neuronal groups
3. Epiphenomenalist position regarding consciousness: non-causal but necessary correlation with underlying neural activity
4. Necessary relationship between causal physical events (C) and non-causal physical events (C) is unclear
5. Arguments against epiphenomenalism: theoretical and empirical considerations

**Issues with Epiphenomenalist Theory:**
1. Relationship between consciousness and underlying neural activity: necessary or contingent?
2. Compatibility with the philosophical zombie argument
3. Difficulties in accounting for neurological conditions (e.g., blindsight, unilateral neglect syndrome)
4. Somatoparaphrenia as an example of conscious processing playing a causal role in dealing with perceptive or proprioceptive information
5. Complexity and wide spectrum of somatoparaphrenic symptoms
6. Fully-fledged somatoparaphrenia: not implied by epiphenomenalism, can be characterized as feelings of estrangement and delusional beliefs.

**Conclusion:**
1. Application of concepts carrying a commitment for a causal role for consciousness in specific scientific contexts
2. Unity of science: physical causal closure taken for granted
3. Challenges and limitations of epiphenomenalism as a theory to explain the nature of consciousness.
4. Importance of more empirical research on brain mechanisms of conscious causal processes.

## 9. The Dissipative Brain and Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics
**Dissipative Many-Body Model of Brain**

**Key Points**:
- Cognitive neurodynamics describes brain's role in directing body and learning through action-perception cycle
- Repetition of process creates global memory store based on attractor landscapes
- Dissipative many-body model provides theoretical framework for underlying neurological activity
- Energy dissipation as heat manifests as ground state coherence changes
- Emergence of classicality from microscopic dynamics is a central feature

**Observations and Data Analysis**:
- Brains of animals and humans exhibit coordinated oscillations of neuron populations
- EEG/ECoG activity shows cortical activation patterns resembling cinematographic frames

**Dissipative Model of Brain**:
- Identifies sources of patterns in large areas of neocortical neuropil
- Carrier waves identified with narrow band oscillations in beta and gamma ranges
- Rapid changes in dynamical state require long-distance neuronal synchronization
- Synchronization over distances is too rapid for mechanisms like dendritic loop currents or chemical transmitters

**Macroscopic Quantum System**:
- Brain functions as a macroscopic quantum system, cannot be explained without microscopic dynamics
- Neurons, glia cells, and other classical elements exist in this model
- Quantum degrees of freedom are electrical dipole fields of biomolecules and water molecules

### Spontaneous Symmetry Breakdown and Order Parameter in Brain Modeling
**Microscopic Dynamics in Neuroscience: Understanding Classical Tools through Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

**Background:**
- Karl Lashley's dilemma (1942) about mass excitation and limited specialized conduction paths in the nervous system
- Confirmation by neuroscientists like Pribram proposing holographic model for understanding psychological data
- Aim: Understanding data using QFT theory of condensed matter systems

**Many-Body Model:**
- Formulated by Ricciardi and Umezawa (1967, 1978, 1979)
- Based on spontaneous breakdown of symmetry (SBS) mechanism

**Symmetry Breakdown:**
- Dual level description in QFT: dynamical level vs. physical level
- Many possibilities for realizing the same dynamics as physical observables
- Non-equivalent copies of spaces of physical states lead to different worlds
- Symmetry properties at the physical level may not be the same as basic dynamic equations

**Order Parameter:**
- Emerges as a classical field marking transition from microscopic scale to macroscopic scale
- Characterizes complexity of underlying dynamics
- Interpreted as density of synaptic interactions in cortical neuropil
- ECoG recordings observed at each point correlate with neural order parameter

**Spontaneous Symmetry Breakdown:**
- Dynamical process where symmetry gets rearranged by inner evolution, not external stimuli
- Central theorem: SBS implies existence of massless bosons (Nambu-Goldstone modes or fields) responsible for long-range correlations and ordering.

**Condensation Process:**
- Transformation B -> B+ generates coherent state with unique phase characterizing vacuum as a condensate of NG modes.

---

### Dissipative Many-Body Model of Brain Dynamics
**Ricciardi and Umezawa Brain Model**

**Memory Description:**
- Memory triggered by external stimulus (SBS)
- Long-range correlations generated by brain dynamics
- NG modes condensed in the vacuum
- Memory code is the condensation density ||
- Not a representation of the stimulus

**Order Parameter and Symmetry Breakdown:**
- Proposed by Fhrlich (1968) and Del Giudice et al. (1985; 1986)
- Electrical polarization density in water matrix and biomolecules
- Characterizing the living phase of matter
- Jibu and Yasue (1995), Jibu, Yasue, and Pribram (1996): symmetry breakdown is rotational symmetry of electrical dipoles
- Refinement: Accounts for density of dipole moments exerted by neuron populations through synaptic interactions

**Extending the Model:**
- Includes dissipative dynamics describing brain's openness to external world (Vitiello, 1995; 2001)
- Brains burn glucose and store energy in glycogen, ATP, and ionic gradients
- Dissipate free energy proportionally to the square of ionic current densities
- fMRI techniques measure metabolic dissipation indirectly

**Formulating Thermodynamic Features:**
- Model's task: formulate thermodynamic features involved in action-perception cycle
- Process of energy dissipation as heat manifests itself in disappearance and emergence of coherence
- Dissipation enables brains to form various ground states, increasing memory capacity

**Memory Capacity Problem:**
- RU model: any subsequent stimulus triggers new NG condensation, erasing previous memory (memory overprinting)
- In dissipative model, brain inner dynamics selects one of possible ground states, each associated with a different memory
- Infinitely many memories can be stored without reciprocal interference due to unitarily inequivalent vacua

**NG Condensate:**
- Transiently retrieved memory (thought, perception, recollection) accessed by a phase transition
- Permanent coupling between brain and environment: dynamic dialog between the two related to consciousness mechanisms

**Recent Developments:**
- Data analysis shows brain non-linear dynamics can be depicted in terms of attractor landscapes
- Each attractor based on nerve cell assembly of cortical neurons pair-wise co-activated during learning
- Memory store based on rich hierarchy of increasingly abstract generalizations

**Conclusion:**
- Theoretical scheme to describe neurological activity underlying observations: formation and properties of imploding and exploding coneical phase gradients, occurrence of null spikes.
- Confirms that functional aspects of brain dynamics are derived as macroscopic manifestations of many-body dynamics.
- Further developments considering other features of non-equilibrium neuronal thermodynamics under study.

## 10. Electromagnetic Bases of the Universality of the Characteristics of Consciousness Quantitative Support
**The Electromagnetic Basis of Consciousness: A Universal Perspective**

**Introduction:**
- Evidence suggests consciousness is related to complex magnetic field configurations in the human brain (picoTesla range)
- Magnetic fields of similar magnitudes exist within galaxies and extragalactic clusters
- This paper explores the possibility of universal conditions for consciousness based on quantitative estimates and theoretical arguments.

**Electromagnetic Bases of Consciousness:**
1. **Chemical Reactions and Neuroelectromagnetic Fields**: Originate from neuronal processes within the human brain
2. **Non-local Consciousness**: Emerges from chemical interactions between synapses or as a field within extracellular space
3. **Scalar Identities**: Do not reveal complexity and information density required for consciousness

**Magnetic Field Estimates:**
1. **Ion Channel Magnetic Fields**: Fundamental value: 10-12 A, resulting magnetic field within the 10 to 100 pT range
2. **Change in Frequency with Magnetic Field Strength**: Within the 1 to 100 Hz range for major cerebral correlates of consciousness
3. **Theta Band (4 Hz - 7 Hz)**: Pivotal frequency relating 40pT field to consciousness pattern and memory processes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

**Conclusion:**
The convergence of these quantitative solutions may provide perspective on integrating previously disparate levels of discourse regarding consciousness. While observing similarities does not guarantee identity or complexity, it offers a potential framework for understanding the relationship between magnetic fields and consciousness within various contexts.

### Quantum Energy and Cosmic Ray Impact on Brain Function
**Mass of an Electron**
- Mass (kg) of electron divided by unit charge (As) multiplied by 7 Hz (1/s) yields a magnetic field strength of 40x10^-12 T
- If intrinsic cerebral magnetic field was applied, i.e., ~10pT, the energy associated would be 1.8x10^-5 J

**Galactic Levels of Intensities and Magnetic Moments**
- Energy associated with a second extracerebral field such as that intrinsic within galaxies is superimposed upon a comparable consciousness field of ~10pT
- The significance of this value becomes apparent when it approaches the rest mass of a photon (10^-52 kg)
- Experimental procedures to these implications have begun

**Neural Systems and Energy**
- Narrow bands of energy or ionic concentrations are interconnected and functionally related in neural systems
- Neuroquantal increment of ~10^-20 J (energy associated with a single action potential) emerges at various levels:
  - Distance between charges on neuronal membrane that create resting potential
  - During intersynaptic transformation of an action potential
  - During phosphorylation
  - Intrinsic energy for electromagnetic wavelength equivalent of a cell (~10m)
  - Energy differential between classical and Compton radius for the electron
- Congruence between generalized background of magnetic fields within and between galaxies and cerebral function suggests potential continuity

**Implications of One Neuron Affecting Cerebral Function**
- Recent studies suggest that firing of only one neuron is sufficient to alter microstate of entire cerebral manifold or determine \"0.1\" condition for a rat's response
- Energy within area of a single cortical column (width ~0.5mm) is about 10^-20 J/s, the energy associated with a single action potential
- The energy density of the entire universe that can be discerned by its mass (~10^(52)kg) divided by a likely volume of 10^79 m3 results in an average value of about 10^-1 J/m3
- Energy density within human brain associated with 10^6 neurons firing at 10 Hz is 10^-13 J, which when divided by the human brain volume (about 10^-3 m3), results in 10^-10 J/m3
- This energy density within brain space is congruent with this average of the whole volume of the universe and satisfies conditions for a hologram.

### Energy Equivalence between Cosmic and Neural Electromagnetic Phenomena
**Cosmic Energy and Human Brain Function**

**Freely Willed Versus Cosmic Energy**:
- Recent interest in radio stars and magnetic fields overlap with cerebral functions
- Question: Could there be congruent solutions with the energy of these stars?
- Energy flux from radio stars is ~10^-16 [W/m2]/Hz
- If assuming 7 Hz (theta range), equivalent energy is 4.637 x 10^-34 J per second (watts)
- This value matches the energy within a 10 m diameter area, similar to the size of a cell soma
- Differences in coefficients are within measurement error
- Suggests that cosmic ray incidence could influence theta activity range and affect perception, memory, consciousness, and free will

**Energy Densities of Human Brain and Biosphere**:
- Energy density of 10^10 neurons within human cerebral volume is about 10^-7 J/m3
- About 70 to 100 lightning flashes per second occur in a narrow shell (2 km) within the biosphere
- Each flash yields ~10^11 J/s, totaling 10^18 J/s
- Volume of the electromagnetic field shell is about 10^-18 m3
- This energy density matches that of average cerebral human activity (thinking and neuronal)
- Cross-sectional current density of lightning channel is equivalent to ~10^5 A/m2
- Comparable quantitative solutions between lightning and action potentials, suggesting universality of consciousness conditions.

## 11. Does Consciousness Exist
**The Existence of Consciousness: A Philosophical Debate**

**Kant's Impact on the Debate**:
- Kant \"undermined\" the soul and brought in the transcendental ego
- The bipolar relation between spirit (soul) and matter has been out of balance ever since
- The spiritual principle attenuates itself to a ghostly condition, losing personal form and activity

**The Author's Position**:
- Consciousness \"is on the point of disappearing altogether\"
- It is a \"name for a nonentity,\" and has no right to be among first principles
- The author suggests consciousness is just a function, not an entity

**The Author's Proposed Solution**:
- If we start with the idea that there is only one primal stuff of material in the world (pure experience), we can explain knowing as a particular relation between parts of pure experience
- This relation is part of pure experience, and one term becomes the subject or knower, while the other becomes the object known

**The Neo-Kantian Perspective**:
- Neo-Kantians see consciousness as the logical correlative of content in an Experience
- Consciousness itself is impersonal, with self and its activities belonging to the content
- Direct evidence of this inner consciousness is believed to be immediately accessible

**The Author's View on Direct Evidence**:
- When we try to fix our attention on consciousness, it seems to vanish

---

### Perception and Dualism in Experience
**Philosopher's Perspective on Consciousness and Experience**

**Dualistic Inner Constitution of Experience:**
- Philosopher discusses consciousness as inexplicable yet referential to a self
- Distinguished from content, but defies closer explanations
- Existence of consciousness fundamental in psychology, can be laid down as certain

**Analysis vs. Addition:**
- Consciousness and content separation: subtraction or addition?
- Paint illustration: menstruum and pigment
- Experience has no inner duplicity; separation comes by way of addition
- Same undivided portion can figure as thought or thing, subjective and objective simultaneously
- Dualism preserved but reinterpreted, concrete and verifiable.

**Perceptual Experience:**
- Common sense perspective: physical object as collection of physical things
- Mind perceives same objects
- Paradox: one reality in two places at once
- Representative theories avoid logical paradox but violate reader's sense of life
- Puzzle of how one identical room can be in two places solved by intersection of processes.

---

### Objectivity in Non-Perceptual Experiences Concepts as Simultaneously Subjective and Objective
**The Objectivity of Non-Perceptual Experiences**

**Two Processes**:
- The reader's personal biography
- The history of the house, including physical operations like carpentry and furnishing

**Distinguishing Percepts from Concepts**:
- The same law holds for conceptual manifolds or memories as for perceptual experiences
- Taking them in their first intention (ignoring their relation to possible perceptual experiences) confines the problem to a world thought of, not directly felt or seen
- This world comes as a chaos of experiences, but lines of order are soon traced

**Obstacles for Seeing Objectivity in Non-Perceptual Experiences**:
- The intrusion of percepts into the reader's mind complicates the question and confuses it
- Percepts tend to be treated as the sole genuine realities, overlooking the objectivity that lies in non-perceptual experiences

**The Objectivity of Non-Perceptual Experiences**:
- A single non-perceptual experience tends to get counted twice:
  - Figures as an object or field of objects in one context
  - As a state of mind in another context
- This is without the least internal self-differentiation into consciousness and content
- The object of thought, even if not directly perceived, occupies its definite place in the outer world

---

### Perception and Consciousness External Relationships
**Relation Between Perception and Thought**

**Immediate vs. Long-term Influence:**
- Both perception and thought influence current conduct with equal reality
- Past experiences, including dreams and daydreams, hold significance in shaping present worldview
- Objects of personal history may have a permanent impact compared to fleeting moments

**Cohesion vs. Loose Associates:**
- Thought-of objects maintain stability through consistent associations with other elements (house, name, etc.)
- Inconsistent or fluid associations show the subjectivity of thought
- Cohesive associates form the system of external realities, while loose ones make up internal thinking

**Representation vs. Represented:**
- Pure experience is valid and objective in its immediate state
- Subjectivity and objectivity are functional attributes realized through retrospective experiences
- Representation occurs when experience is taken twice and considered in relation to contexts

**Consciousness as a Relational Concept:**
- Consciousness does not denote a special way of being or unique stuff
- The knowing quality of experiences is better explained by their relations to one another.

---

### Challenges to the Theory of Pure Experience
**Objections to the Theory of Pure Experience**

**Objection 1:**
- If experience has no conscious existence, what is it made of?
- We cannot know or describe this \"stuff\" of pure experience.
- Hodgson's analysis leaves nothing to be desired.

**Reply:**
- There is no general \"stuff\" or substance of which all experiences are made.
- Each type of experience is made up of the \"appearance\" of its own specific object (e.g., space, intensity, color).
- Experience is a collective name for various sensible natures.

**Objection 2:**
- If the same piece of pure experience serves as both thought and thing, how can its attributes differ fundamentally?
- Attributes that appear compatible with thought (e.g., easy, beautiful) cannot be attributed to a physical object.
- The solution lies in the radical dualism between thought and thing.

**Counterarguments:**
- Thought and thing have some common categories (relationship to time, ability to be complex or simple).
- Attributes such as beauty, happiness, intensity can qualify both thoughts and objects.
- Descartes' definition of thought as unextended is problematic when considering the mental picture of an extended object.
- The difference between objective and subjective extension lies in their relationships to context.

**Counterargument on Extension:**
- Inner experience is not absolutely inextendable; both worlds differ by relations of extensions, not presence or absence.
- Facts about extension put us on the track of truth for other qualities.

**Case Study: Heat and Water**
- We call fire hot and water wet, but refuse to say our mental state is wet or hot when it's an image of these objects.
- The difference lies in the fact that some fires burn sticks and warm bodies while others do not act at all.

---

### Perception and Consciousness The Evolution of Subjective Qualities
**Understanding Consciousness and Reality: Experiences as Attributes vs. Qualities**

**Experiences with Active Natures:**
- Can be contrasted from unreal, mental experiences
- Affect associates through emotional connections and objective value
- Modify contexts, exclude certain associates, determine others
- Coexist in complex experiences (beauty & ugliness) but less stubbornly than physical qualities

**The Evolution of Psychical from Physical:**
- Dualism: fundamental datum not to be contradicted
- Consciousness as a phenomenon, possibly rooted in breathing
- Other internal facts enhance consciousness through immediate perception
- Breath as the essence of philosophers' constructed entity called consciousness

**Further Explanation:**
- Inner experiences are real while the construct of consciousness is fictitious
- Thoughts in concrete are made of the same stuff as things
- A more detailed explanation will be provided in an upcoming article.

## 12. Consciousness -- What Is It
**Consciousness: Understanding Its Complexities Beyond Brain Activity**

**Approaches in Science:**
- Type I science: forward process, based on agreed concepts and established knowledge (bulk of everyday science)
- Type II science: reverse process, attempts to establish appropriate concepts for unexplained phenomena (major paradigm shifts)

**Discussing Consciousness:**
- Natural to begin with the brain as a forward approach
- Challenges and conceptual problems in considering consciousness as brain activity
- Importance of testing hypotheses by looking for facts that are incompatible, not just agreeable

**Topics Discussed:**
1. Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs)
2. Reincarnation and Past Life Memories
3. Interactions Between Consciousnesses
4. Healing at a Distance
5. Concluding Thoughts

**Section 1: Introduction**
- Oscar Wilde's thought on defining consciousness
- Distinction between Type I and II science
- Complexity of discussing consciousness

**Section 2: Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs)**
- Definition and prevalence of OBEs
- Neural mechanisms proposed to explain OBEs as hallucinations or illusions
- Challenges in linking altered brain physiology with accurate out-of-body perceptions.

---

### Veridical Out-of-Body Experiences Case Studies and Corroborations
**Out-of-Body Perceptions:**
* Some critics argue they are hallucinatory based on neurophysiological findings (Joseph et al.)
* Others believe they represent external reality beyond senses, needing explanation of mind-body relationship (Kelly et al., 2007)
* Subjective experiences: no evidence of actual separation from body in some cases
* Accurate perceptions reported, including unlikely details and distance observations
* Corroboration by others in some cases (Cook et al., Hart, Ring & Lawrence, Vandermeulen et al.)
* Not all OBEs are veridical or corroborated
* Some reports provide no evidence beyond subjective experience.

**Veridical Perceptions:**
* Occurring at a distance from the body, beyond reach of senses
* Examples: woman in childbirth reporting mother smoking, cardiac arrest patient recognizing nurse, Wilmot case
* Criticism: lack of corroborating testimony in many cases (paucity)
* Some cases have been verified by others (Cook et al., Vandermeulen et al.)

**Reciprocal Apparitions:**
* Person having OBE sees person at distant location unaware of the experience
* Examples: Wilmot case, nurse visiting quadriplegic patient in dream
* Summarized by Hart (1954) in 30 published cases up to that time
* Unpublished case from University of Virginia collection: nurse's dream about telling patient to keep fighting corroborated.

---

### Childhood Past-Life Memories Cases and Evidence of Reincarnation
**Experiments with Out of Body Experiences (OBEs)**
- **Tart's Study**: Woman able to read a five-digit number during OBE, verified by EEG in lab
- **Morris et al. Experiment**: Person who could induce OBEs at will affected strain gauge sensor at specific location
- Suggests veridical OBE perception may be objectively real, implying consciousness can separate from body under certain circumstances

**Children's Reports of Past Lives**
- Systematic study on over 2,500 cases in last 50 years (Stevenson, 2001)
- Easiest to find in cultures with belief in reincarnation, but cases found worldwide including US and Western Europe
- Strongest cases include statements that accurately describe life of deceased individual
- Example: Kumkum Verma, girl in India who described previous life as woman in Darbhanga, matching details verified
- Children report memories at early age (average 35 months), stop by age six or seven
- Statements spontaneous with no urging from parents; describe ordinary lives but often include unusual death
- Some children report being deceased family members or strangers in other locations
- Many show behaviors associated with apparent memories: emotions, phobias, play themes connected to occupation.

### Connected Consciousness in Twins and Healing at a Distance
**Birthmarks and Birth Defects as Evidence of Consciousness Transfer**
- Mental images can produce specific somatic effects in some individuals, such as hypnotized subjects developing blisters after being told they are being burned by a hot object (Gauld, 1992)
- Children born with birthmarks or birth defects similar to the wounds of a deceased individual suggest that their consciousness may have been influenced by that individual's final mental images
- Evidence for persistence of consciousness after death

**Linked Consciousness in Twins**
- Twins exhibiting non-physical connections: shared emotions, mental images, and somatic symptoms
  - Student woke up crying about sister's danger, accurately predicted explosion (Playfair, 2008)
  - Sister felt daughter's pain while they were miles apart (Gaddis & Gaddis, 1972)
- Connections can manifest physically or mentally
- Evidence for a persistent non-physical link between some twins, even those raised apart

**Consciousness Between Different Individuals: ESP and Healing at a Distance**
- Independent existence of consciousness raises questions about its properties and connections with other individuals
- Extra-sensory perception (ESP) provides evidence for a potential linkage between different conscious beings
  - Voluminous experimental evidence exists for ESP phenomena
- Further consideration of this topic in Section 2 and 3's discussion of consciousness and its relationship to personality or essential identity.

### Exploring the Impact and Mechanisms of Distant Healing on Biological Systems
**Studies on Compassionate Healing Intentions**
- Clinical and laboratory research explores effects of healing intentions on biological functions in remote individuals
- Challenges: ensuring no unintentional contact with prayer or healing thoughts for control group, ethical considerations
- Significant findings include positive impacts on cardiopulmonary patients (Byrd, 1988) and AIDS patients (Sicher et al., 1998)

**Laboratory Studies on Healing Effects**
- Pioneering work by Bernard Grad at McGill University on healing effects in mice and plant growth rates (Grad, 1965)
- Recent studies show inexperienced volunteers can produce full cures in mice infected with mammary adenocarcinoma (Bengston & Krinsley, 2000)
- Resonant bonding between experimental and control mice observed (Bengston & Moga, 2007)

**Significance of These Studies**
- Jonas and Crawford reviewed over 2,200 published reports on spiritual healing, energy medicine, and mental intention effects (Jonas & Crawford, 2003)
- Strict CONSORT criteria gave high grades to studies involving inanimated objects, intercessory prayer, and nonhuman experiments

**Possible Explanation for Healing Effects**
- Hypothesis: Consciousness not limited to brain activity; could be an entity or soul (speculative)
- Complexity: Consciousness may be carried out in a desktop computer or \"the cloud,\" associating multiple consciousnesses with one person.

**Caution and Tentativeness**
- Understanding the nature of consciousness remains elusive despite neuroscience advancements (Maddox, 1999)
- Importance to keep an open mind and approach any theory or explanation with caution.

### Entanglement and Collective Human Consciousness Quantum Connections in Minds
**Famous Opinions About Consciousness**
- Fodor: \"Nobody has the slightest idea how anything material could be conscious\" (1992)
- Kaufman: \"Nobody has the faintest idea what consciousness is\" (2011)
- Wigner: Physics may not be up to the task of deciphering the nature of the mind (1983)
- Penrose: \"My position [on consciousness] demands a major revolution in physics\" (2003)
- Herbert: \"Science's biggest mystery is the nature of consciousness\" (1987)

**Entanglement as a Possible Explanation for Consciousness**
- Schrdinger coined term entanglement and proposed linked minds (1935, 1969, 1983)
  * Entangled particles remain linked even after separation
  * Quantum entanglement demonstrated experimentally
- Experiments suggest human brains may be entangled at a distance (Standish et al., 2003, 2004; Wackerman et al., 2003)
  * Suggests Schrdinger's idea of united, linked minds may be more than philosophical speculation
- Quantum entanglement a useful metaphor for distant correlated human experiences

**Caution Regarding Entanglement as Explanation for Human Consciousness**
- Nonlocal connections between entangled particles cannot be used to transfer information (Nadeau & Kafatos, 1999)
- Information transferred between distant, entangled humans, fMRI or EEG patterns, telepathic exchanges (Achterberg et al., 2005; Radin, 1997, 2006)
- Possible role of compassion, love, and empathy in these phenomena (Achterberg et al., 2005)
- Entangled actions and emotions of human beings unlikely to be fully accounted for by quantum entanglement alone.

**Consciousness Research: Type II versus Type I**
- Current research on OBEs, reincarnation, anomalous healing as beginning of major long-term program
- Need to develop more powerful and fruitful concepts to elucidate the nature of consciousness (Sturrock, 2009)
- Revision of current Model of Reality may involve concept of hyperspace (Sturrock, 2009).

## 13. Consciousness Solvable and Unsolvable Problems
**Proposed Theses on Consciousness**

**Thesis 1**: The \"hard problem\" of consciousness is not a mystery, but its formulation makes a straightforward answer impossible in principle.

**Reasoning**:
- Contents of consciousness (e.g., emotions, self-awareness) cannot be fully explained by neurophysiological processes, as they are subjective experiences of internal states.
- These internal experiences cannot be expressed or understood through an observer language, which can only describe observable phenomena.
- Attempts to differentiate consciousness from material systems may stem from a lack of understanding the untranslatability between observer and ego languages.

**Thesis 2**: Pre-consciousness (PC) exists throughout the animal kingdom, with different levels (PC1, PC2, etc.) that evolve up to human consciousness (HC).

**Reasoning**:
- Some organisms can experience colors but not express them in an ego language.
- Exclusive internal experiences cannot be duplicated or shared by other organisms, making them unique to the individual.
- The existence of pre-consciousness refutes the idea that consciousness is a non-material entity separate from the material world.

**Thesis 3**: Neither PC nor HC are epiphenomena; they serve a real function and have evolved in different forms throughout species.

**Reasoning**:
- Without consciousness, simpler forms of consciousness (PC) would not have allowed complex organisms to survive and thrive.
- Denying the existence of consciousness in robots leads to extreme solipsism or anti-machine racism.
- The development of human-like robots does not prove they can experience emotions or consciousness like humans, but we should wait for their self-reported confirmation.

### Form Theory The Emergence of Information and Life
**Novel Theory: Forms and Information Processing Systems (I-Systems)**

**2.1 Basics of Worldview:**
- Universe consists only of E/M (mass or energy)
- Measurable variously with different instruments
- Human knowledge deals mostly in sets (classes) of states
- Introduce I-systems to organize chaos and facilitate action
  * Realize one-to-one correspondence between input and output sets

**2.1.1 Elementary Idea:**
- Every system identifying and discriminating specific sets of E/M substrate states is an I-system
- Can also identify different types of forms with various identification criteria

**2.1.2 Basic Definition:**
- A set of identified and discriminated EM substrate states is a *form
  * Realized by an I-system when there's isomorphism between input and output

**2.1.3 Postulate:**
- Notions like form, shape, figure, configuration etc., can be defined as a *form
- Signals, messages, stimuli, units of information, perceptions, knowledge are rigorously defined as a *form

**2.1.4 Shannon's Theory:**
- Measures amount of information carried by a form based on probability of transmitted form at source and uncertainty for receiver

**2.1.5 Content of Information:**
- No such thing as content; study relevant I-systems to analyze functions of forms

**2.1.6 Origins of Life:**
- Emergence of sets of states of an E/M substrate capable of self-replication (origin of life)

**2.2 Role in Origin of Life:**
- I-systems play crucial role in development and reproduction during origin of life
  * Locomotion to increase probability of nutrient contact
  * Development of detection systems for locating nutrients
  * Savings of energy lead to the development of complex I-systems.

### Unification and Coordination of Subsystems for Survival
**Theoretical Framework for Understanding I-Systems and Emotions**

**I. Introduction:**
- Discussion of various types of input/output systems (I-systems) in animals, including innate and learned systems
- Emphasis on the importance of these systems for survival and adaptability to environments

**II. Advantages of Internal Models:**
1. Adaptation to variable environments:
   - Innate input-output links may become less efficient
   - Feedback loops introduce variety in response to environmental changes (e.g., danger, mating)
2. Internal neural models:
   - Development of systems that link sets of neural complexes to different inputs and outputs
3. Coordination of activities:
   - Efficient management of various subsystems through emotional I-system (E-system)
4. Emotional responses:
   - Simplistic internal models detect relevant aspects of the environment for basic needs
5. Functional Unity:
   - Achieves greater adaptive value by coordinating activities essential for survival

**III. Distinction between I-Systems and Their Components:**
- Theoretical distinction does not imply clear separation within nervous system
- Interaction of neuron complexes in different parts of brain can result in functional units

**IV. Overlooked Subsystem: Emotional System (E-system)**
1. Regulation of interaction between needs
2. Mobilization, intensification, inhibition, switching of systems
3. Essential for survival by responding appropriately to situations
4. Manages hierarchy of behaviors and coordination of subsystems
5. Not always distinctly observable as a separate component within nervous system

**V. Human Emotions:**
1. Shared with animals: basic emotions occur in both humans and animals
2. Same effects on behavior situations connected to basic needs (hunger, mating, danger)
3. Increasing unification and coordination leads to more complex emotional states
4. Awareness of unity enhances emotional experiences and consciousness
5. Prehuman states of preconsciousness (PC1, PC2, PCn) plausible hypothesis for understanding development and intensification of emotions over time
6. No need for an unintelligible leap in the case of emotions and consciousness.

## 14. Decoding the Chalmers Hard Problem of Consciousness Qualia of the Molecular Biology of Creativity and Thought
**The Hard Problem of Consciousness: Bridging the Explanatory Gap between Functions and Experience**

**Introduction**:
- Chalmers' Hard Problem of Consciousness: The problem of experience beyond function performance
- Need for an explanatory bridge to account for conscious experience
- Contributing extra ingredients to bridge the gap

**Evolutionary Perspective on Bridging the Gap**:
- Quoting Darwin from \"The Origin of Species\" on natural selection and evolution
  - Daily and hourly scrutiny and improvement of organic beings
  - Slow changes in progress, imperfect view into past ages

**Figure 1: The Evolutionary Complex Adaptive System**
- Illustration of system including culture, qualia, eRNA, genes, and brain growth

**Current Epigenetic Research**:
- Qualia of experience dialogue with DNA via RNA molecules
- Novel qualia contribute to adaptive updating of consciousness on the molecular-genomic level

**Adaptive Function of Qualia**:
- Daily and hourly cycles of human experience from quantum to cognitive-behavioral levels

---

### Complex Adaptive Systems and RNA World Molecular Underpinnings of Consciousness Evolution
**Evolution of Complex Adaptive Systems in Consciousness**

**Rapparini's Theory (2010)**
- Evolution process began with inorganic chemical compounds
- Life, thought and consciousness emerged as a bonus, cannot be explained solely on computational basis
- In quantum physics, there is no ontology of the world but only observations representing epistemic knowledge
- Necessary to introduce psychological dimension to complete picture
- Brain considered part of physical world (observed), which generates representations (qualia) including representation of itself
- Innovative definition of qualia: mind is the qualia of brain's neural mechanisms, how perceiver perceives himself from within
- Closing explanatory gap allows for mind to change brain through self-directed neuroplasticity in agreement with Buddhist belief on mental power of meditation.

**Role of eRNAs and Gene Regulation**
- Research on Zebra Finch genome: song behavior engages gene regulatory networks, altering expression of long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, transcription factors, and targets
- First time microRNA shown to respond to particular thought process
- Proposed that eRNAs are an extra ingredient mediating between novel qualia of activity or experience-dependent gene expression that underpins brain plasticity and consciousness.

**Cellular Decisions and RNAs as Sensing-Actuation Devices**
- Cell decisions depend on regulatory networks controlling enzymatic activities, protein translocation, genetic response
- Central to genetic programming is ability to process information within cellular networks and link it to new behaviors
- RNA a promising substrate for interfacing with cellular networks due to versatile sensing and actuation functions and ease of designing RNA structures.

### Basic Rest-Activity Cycle and SELEX Molecular Analogues of Human Performance and RNA World Evolution
**RNA World and the Origin of Life**
- **RNA world**: Proposed precursor to DNA-based life that relied on RNA for sensing, signaling, and catalytic self-replication
- RNA had more fragile but versatile molecular \"software\" compared to the more stable DNA memory hardware
- RNA and DNA co-evolved through a process called **SELEX (Selection of Ligands by EXponential amplification)**, which is akin to the Basic Rest-Activity Cycle (BRAC) of human performance

**Basic Rest-Activity Cycle (BRAC)**
- The 90-120 minute BRAC is a chronobiological foundation for ultradian rhythms in human consciousness and experience
- The **Qualia of the BRAC** can be contrasted when people take appropriate rest breaks versus when they forgo them, leading to stress or psychosomatic symptoms

**4-Stage Creative Cycle**
- Illustrated in Figure 5 with the proteomics, genomics, and qualia profiles of Buddha's Four Noble Truths
- Involves the **Novelty-Numinosum-Neurogenesis Effect**, which can turn on gene expression and brain plasticity through both neuroscientific (bottoms-up) and spiritual (top-down) perspectives

---

### Molecular Biology of Qualia in Mind-Body Healing
**Qualia Associated with Experience-Dependent Gene Expression and Brain Plasticity**

**Ramakrishna's Research:**
- Three qualia associated with experience-dependent gene expression and brain plasticity: initiation, elongation, release, and recycling
- Similarities between stages of cellular translation process and creative cycle

**Riboswitches and Boolean Logic Gates:**
- Regulate experience-dependent gene expression
- Function as molecular infrastructure for creativity and thought
- Complexity can be increased through tandem riboswitches to respond to multiple chemical signals

**Molecular Basis of Memory & Learning during Sleep and Dreaming:**
- Dreams simulate past events and future expectations for adaptive behavior
- Consolidation of new memories and learning occurs during slow wave sleep (SW) and REM state dreaming
- Adaptive scenarios are created, selected, and generalized through memory processing during the circadian cycle

**Creative Psychosocial Genomic Model:**
- Novel experiences in waking hours induce mind-brain dialogues during slow wave sleep and REM state dreaming for adaptive behavior
- Evolutionary theory of sleep and dreaming: dreams prolong neuronal reverberation to promote memory consolidation

**The Creative Psychosocial Genomic Healing Experience:**
- Pilot study using DNA microarrays to explore molecular genomic underpinnings of qualia associated with mind-body healing and problem solving
- Hypothesis that top-down, creatively oriented experience can modulate qualia-dependent gene expression and various brain plasticity effects like stem cell growth, reduced oxidative stress, and decreased chronic inflammation.

## 15. Protophenomena and their Physical Correlates
**Understanding Phenomenal Consciousness: Protophenomena and Their Physical Correlates**

**Background:**
- Philosophers distinguish between functional consciousness and phenomenal consciousness
- Phenomenal consciousness is subjective experience, the Hard Problem
- Current physical theory doesn't explain subjective experience (Zombie problem)
- Different approach required to solve the Hard Problem: neuromyohenological reduction

**Protophenomenal Analysis:**
- Conscious state has parts that relate to each other
- Reduction of phenomenal consciousness to simpler conscious phenomena possible
  - Visual experience can be divided into elementary patches of brightness, color, texture etc.
- Neurobiology and experimental phenomenology inform each other through reductions
- Stopping point in neurobiology: single neuron as unit of neural activity

**Protophenomena:**
- Smallest units of subjectivity
- Contribution to conscious state made by a single neuron
- Can be understood as the experience related to a single neuron's receptive field (e.g., simple visual experience of an oriented edge)

**Key Concepts:**
- Hard Problem: relation of subjective experience to physical processes
- Neuromyohenological reduction: parallel reductions in subjective experience and neurobiology
- Protophenomena: smallest units of subjectivity contributing to conscious state.

---

### Physical Bases for Phenomenal Consciousness
**Phenomenology and Protophenomena**

**Phenomenology**:
- Studies the structure of phenomena, or things that appear in conscious experience
- Phenomena are made up of protophenomena, the elementary constituents of conscious mental life

**Protophenomena**:
- Protophenomena are analogous to atoms in the subjective realm
- They are the individual contributions to a coherent whole, like neurons in the brain
- Their interdependencies parallel the connections between neurons

**Consciousness and Protophenomena**:
- Protophenomenal analysis implies a structural theory of qualia, where qualities arise from interconnections rather than inherent properties
- Some neurophysiological processes have conscious phenomena, while others do not
- Protophenomena correspond to small-scale neurophysiological processes, called the correlative activity of protophenomena
- Identifying these physical processes is fundamental to determining whether robots could have phenomenal consciousness

**Possible Correlate Activities**:
- Impulse rate at the axon hillock
- Ion flux across the somatic membrane
- Somatic membrane potential
- Graduated electrical fields and currents in the dendritic tree
- Neurotransmitter flux, binding to receptors, or membrane potential of a dendritic spine
- These are possible correlative activities for protophenomena, but experimental evidence is lacking

---

### Theorizing Physical Correlates of Consciousness Through Entropy and Information
**Norman D. Cook's Suggestion for Protophenomenon:**
- Protophenomenon corresponds to nerve cell membrane opening during impulse generation (Cook, 2000, 2002a, 2002b, chs. 67, 2008)
  * Single-cell protophenomenon: momentary opening of the cell to its environment at action potential
  * Increases correlation between internal and external states
  * Decreases entropy of entire system by increasing mutual information
  * Fundamental information process and elementary act of protocognition

**Chalmers' Suggestion for Protophenomena:**
- Physical information spaces have associated protophenomena (Chalmers, 1996)
- Based on vague notion of differences that make a difference

**Approach to Understanding Consciousness:**
- Combines Cook's and Chalmers insights with thermodynamics
- Living systems maintain themselves in far-from-equilibrium state using free energy and matter for internal organization (Schrdinger, What is Life?, 1945/1967; Schneider, 2005)
- Information as negative entropy critical to understanding differences that make a difference
- Developing empirically verifiable theory of phenomenal consciousness based on thermodynamics, information theory, cellular biochemistry, and neuroscience.

**Research Questions:**
1. Can Chalmers' notions of physical information spaces and differences that make a difference be explained in terms of the thermodynamics of order and information?
2. What are the most plausible physical activity sites associated with protophenomena?
3. Which psychophysical experiments could discriminate among hypotheses concerning the physical processes that could be correlative activities of protophenomena?
4. Theoretical investigation into protophenomenal analysis, information theory, and thermodynamics to account for phenomenal consciousness and its physical correlates.
5. Validation of theory in the context of human phenomenal consciousness
6. Identification of physical processes associated with protophenomena more precisely.
7. Focus on pyramidal cell as primary agent making decisions that make a difference, but results not expected to depend on cell type.

### Experimental Methods for Identifying Physical Correlates of Consciousness
**Challenges in Connecting Neurons to Thermodynamics:**
- Neurons do not survive independently, so connection to thermodynamics is indirect through survival of organism and species
- Analyzing receptor binding and gated ion channels can provide deeper understanding of cell's connection with environment and decision making units
- Allosteric proteins in these receptors and gates implement information processing networks within the cell
- Closing the gap between low-level physical processes and self-organization of entire organisms, species, and ecosystems is necessary for a comprehensive framework

**Empirical Investigation of Protophenomena:**
- Objective: Define experimental protocols to identify physical correlates of protophenomena in artificial systems
- Tasks:
  - Identify most plausible activity sites based on theoretical analysis
  - Outline experimental protocols confirming or refuting hypotheses about specific physical processes being correlative activities
- Experimental approach:
  - Identify salient and relatively isolable experiential protophenomenon with known neural locus
  - Test hypotheses that a certain kind of correlative physical activity is necessary and sufficient for the presence of the corresponding protophonenon in conscious state
  - Establish necessity through artificial creation of physical activity and demonstrating lack of effect on consciousness
- Limitations: Enormous practical and ethical challenges, but defining experiments clearly demonstrates scientific nature of hypotheses.

**Potential Experimental Techniques:**
- Delivering individual neurotransmitter molecules to dendritic spines with a spatial resolution of 1 micron and time resolution of 1 millisecond (Losonczy et al., 2008)
- Controlling channels and enzymes in intact animals using light-sensitive proteins and neuron-level millisecond precision (Zemelman et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2007)
- Precise control of activation by two-photon glutamate uncaging (Pettit et al., 1997)

These techniques may be used to investigate activity sites in humans and identify preconditions for artificial phenomenal consciousness.

## 16. The Macro-Objectification Problem and Conscious Perceptions
**Problem with Quantum Theory and Perceptions:**
- Discussing compatibility of definite perceptions with linear nature of quantum theory

8. Two possible states: |) and | )
9. Linear nature allows combinations with complex coefficients

**Part II (to be continued):**
- Reconsidering problem in light of collapse models
- Discussion of how these models account for natural processes, including definite perceptions.

---

### Quantum Measurement and Uncertainty Principle
**Quantum Mechanics: Overview and Formal Structure**

**Operators:**
- Corresponds to classical observables (e.g., angular momentum) in quantum mechanics
- Eigenvalues are real, discrete, and usually discrete with orthogonal eigenvectors
- Complete set of states for the space

**Evolution Equation:**
- Deterministic, linear Schrdinger equation
- Linear evolution: if |i\_t = e^(-iHt) |i\_0, then | a\_i |i\_0   a\_i |i\_t

**Predictions:**
- Probabilistic
- State expressed as linear combination of eigenstates: | =  ci |i
- Theory makes precise probabilistic predictions for outcomes (k) of measurements
- Probability P(k|) given by modulus square of corresponding coefficient c_k

**Observables:**
- Commuting observables have same eigenstates and admit precisely defined values when in a common eigenstate
- Uncertainty principle: making one observable precise makes others imprecise (e.g., position vs momentum)

**Measurement Process:**
- Changes state instantaneously to eigenstate corresponding to measured observable's eigevalue
- Nonlinear and stochastic change induced by measurement process

---

### Quantum Measurement Problem and Entanglement
**Quantum Measurement Problem**

**Indeterminacy and Measurements**:
- Making an observation of one variable (x) renders the other variable (w) maximally indeterminate
- A measurement changes the state of the system instantaneously
- If a measurement on x results in +1, the statevector |> becomes aligned with the x-axis at 45 degrees

**Continuous Observables**:
- Not all observable quantities are quantized, some can take any value within a continuous interval (e.g., position and momentum)
- This implies formal mathematical refinements which will not be discussed in detail

**Wavefunction Interpretation**:
- The wavefunction ((x)) appearing in Eq. (4) has the following interpretations:
  - Normalization condition: ||^2 = 1
  - Probability density: |(x)|^2 gives the probability of finding the particle at x when measuring position

**Quantum Measurement Problem**:
- Suppose we have a system in an eigenstate of an observable and want to measure its value
- We need an apparatus A with a ready state (|A0>) and a micro-macro interaction that evolves the system into a definite macroscopic outcome (|Ai)
- This leads to Eq. (6), which describes a superposition of possible outcomes, not just the expected one
- The resulting final state is an \"entangled\" system-apparatus state that does not describe well-defined properties for either the microsystem or the macroscopic pointer

---

### Measurement Problem and Superselection Rules in Quantum Mechanics
**Quantum Mechanics and Measurement Problem**

**Superposition of States in Quantum Mechanics**:
- The orthodox way is to claim that the final situation is described by one of the terms in a superposition, all corresponding to a pointer pointing at a precise position
- Standard quantum mechanics contains two evolution laws: linear for microscopic systems and nonlinear/stochastic for wavepacket reduction (WPR)

**Problem with Quantum Mechanics**:
- The theory does not contain any formal element identifying when one or the other type of evolution occurs
- Macroscopic systems requiring quantum treatment exist, but boundary is unclear

**von Neumann's Chain and Ideal Measurement Process**:
- John von Neumann's chain is a sequence of measurement procedures aimed to identify the actual state of affairs
- The idealized version assumes 100% efficiency, final states are strictly orthogonal, etc.

**Unavoidability of Superpositions**:
- Some authors argue that the measurement problem arises from an over-idealized scheme
- But a recent paper by Bassi and Ghirardi showed that if quantum mechanics is unrestricted, superpositions of macroscopically and perceptibly different states cannot be avoided
- This requires either accepting the \"break\" (abandoning the superposition principle) or assuming consciousness leads to WPR

**Attempts at Solutions**:
- An interesting proposal is the idea of **superselection rules**, which assume all observables of a macroscopic object form an abelian set, making the statistical mixture after WPR indistinguishable from the superposition

---

### Quantum Decoherence Interaction with Environment Explained
**Challenges with Assumptions in Quantum Mechanics**
- **Problem with Hamiltonians**: If assumption is correct, Hamiltonian should commute with all observables, but it cannot drive a pointer state from one to a macroscopically different state (Everett III and DeWitt, 1957; de Witt, 1971)
- **Issue with Energy**: Energy of the whole system is not an observable, which is nonsensical (Daneri et al., 1962)

**Proposed Solutions**

**Many Universes Interpretations**:
- Suggests that all potentialities become actual in different universes, continuous multifurcation of the universe associated to superpositions of macroscopic states
- Unsatisfactory vagueness: Not clear when superselection rules become effective or when splitting of universe/brain should occur (Albert & Loewer, 1988)

**Bohmian Mechanics**:
- Quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory, requires hidden variables to characterize system state
- Hidden variables are initial positions of particles; scheme is deterministic and agrees with quantum predictions (Bohm, 1952a,b)
- Overcomes difficulties related to wavefunction reduction (WPR), but does not meet psycho-physical correspondence if perception is fully determined by brain particle locations

**Decoherence**:
- Approaches based on unavoidable interaction with environment and subsequent decoherence of macrostates
- Replaces Eq.(7) with Eq.(9) to account for environmental degrees of freedom
- Shows that superpositions of different macroscopic states are extremely difficult to observe due to environmental interactions (Zurek, 1981, 1982, 1991; Grifths, 1984, 1996; Gell-Mann & Hartle, 1990)
- Deals with ensembles instead of individuals, but different statistical ensembles can give rise to identical physics in quantum mechanics (obviously probabilities differ from those implied by the quantum formalism when state is final).

---

### GRW Model Collapse of the Quantum Wave Function
**New Approach to Quantum Mechanics: GRW Model**
- Proposed solution to problem of wave function collapse in quantum mechanics (Bell, 1990; Ghirardi et al., 1986)
- Unified theory governing all natural processes, in agreement with quantum predictions for microscopic processes and inducing objectification of macroscopic systems properties.

**Assumptions:**
- System of N particles: configuration space wave function (r, ..., r).
- Particles undergo standard evolution plus random localization processes around appropriate positions at mean frequency .
- Localizations occur with higher probability in areas where standard theory has greater probability of finding particle.
- After localization, wavefunction normalized to maintain normalization.

**Trigger Mechanism:**
- Suppresses linear superposition of states (H and T) corresponding to macroscopically different locations.
- Localizations occur more frequently for macroscopic systems than microscopic ones due to the trigger mechanism.

**Parameters:**
- Mean frequency of localizations .
- Accuracy 1/ (proposed values: 10 Hz for nucleons).

**Advantages:**
- Allows definition of boundary between micro and macroscopic worlds, reversible and irreversible processes, quantum and classical.
- Testable against quantum mechanics with proposals being difficult to implement due to current technology limitations.

---

### Dynamic Reduction Mechanism and Conscious Perception Conflict
**GRW Theory and Perception**

**Superposition Principle Failure**:
- Identifies sets of mesoscopic processes that may reveal failure of superposition principle
- Most physics doesn't depend on both parameters, but their product (OOA)
- Changing one or two orders of magnitude of this value conflicts with experimentally established facts

**Discretized Model**:
- Universe divided into elementary cells with volume 1O-15 cm3 related to localization accuracy
- Superposition of two states (Inl, n2, ...) and Im1, m2, ...) differing in particle occupation numbers
- Dynamical suppression rate governed by sum over all universe cells

**Perceptual Time Scales**:
- Universal dynamics characterizing theory doesn't allow persistence for perceptual times of a superposition with significant difference in location of Planck mass (10^18 nucleons)

**Relation to Penrose's Idea**:
- Suggests relation with Penrose's claim that Planck mass defines boundary between quantum universe and world of definite perceptions

**Collapse Theories and Perception**:
- Objection by Albert & Vaidman on GRW theory's account for definite perceptions
- Spin 1/2 particle going through Stern-Gerlach apparatus, ending up in superposition
- Fluorescent screen produces linear superposition of two rays from different points A and B
- Argument that no way for GRW dynamics to induce reduction on one state due to few particles and photons involved
- Human observer has definite perception of which ray comes from A or B, challenging collapse theories

**Counterargument**:
- Superposition persists until eye is stimulated (can be proven by interference)
- Sufficient number of ions displaced by spatial amount satisfying GRW conditions for reduction within perception time scale
- Human nervous system is physical system performing same function as a macroscopic pointer if no other device interacts with photons

**Importance**:
- Analysis does not imply physicalistic explanation of conscious perceptions, only accounts for definiteness using dynamical reduction mechanism.

## 17. A Mindful Alternative to the MindBody Problem
**Mindfulness and Mindlessness**

**Background:**
- Age-old mind/body problem challenges philosophers and scientists
- Long line of thinkers propose mind and body are two sides of the same coin (mind-body monism)
- Current research indicates turning tides towards accepting this idea

**Mindfulness Definition:**
1. Active state of mind characterized by novel distinction-drawing
2. Present, sensitive to context and perspective
3. Guided but not governed by rules and routines
4. Engagement leads to uncertainty and choice (free will)
5. Reveals possibilities for alternative choices
6. Allows doubt
7. Not predetermined by the past
8. Useful in science when employed with mindfulness

**Mindlessness Definition:**
1. Inactive state of mind characterized by reliance on distinctions and categories drawn in the past
2. Past overdetermines present
3. Trapped in a single perspective but oblivious to entrapment
4. Insensitive to context
5. Rules and routines govern behavior
6. Comes about by default rather than design
7. Lack of choice and new possibilities
8. Certainties lead to mindlessness, often mistaken for facts in science.

### Mindfulness and the Flexibility of Cognitive Categories
**Mindfulness Practice and Uncontrollable Assumptions:**
* Practice makes it hard to question basic assumptions, like uncontrollability of diseases
* Misunderstanding of science findings:
  * Chronic diseases are often seen as uncontrollable based on misconceptions
  * Science can only prove possibility or indeterminacy, not uncontrollability
* Experiments have hidden parameters and decision-makings that lead to an illusion of knowing
* People seek certainty and confuse their mindsets with the stability of underlying phenomena

**Conceptual Categories:**
* Cars as an example: no inherent core features making them cars
* Brain processes do not use set concepts, thoughts remain flexible
* Concepts represented by loose amalgamation of instances, examples, functions, and characteristics

**Mindfulness vs. Mindlessness:**
* Engaging the world dynamically and flexibly is essential for mindfulness practice
* Benefits of mindfulness include well-being, health, competition, relationship satisfaction, effective leadership, creativity, and improved performance
* Research on music: mindfully played piece preferred over replicated one in terms of coordination and audience preference.

**Mind vs. Body:**
* Conceptual boundaries like \"mind\" and \"body\" are artificial and rigid
* Putting mind and body back together leads to improvements at the level of brain processes.

### Placebo Effects on Physical Functionality
**Study Findings on Elderly Men:**
1. **Retrofitted Time Travel Study**:
   - Elderly men spent a week in a timeless retreat retrofitted to 20 years earlier.
   - Experimental group spoke about the past in present tense, comparison group reminisced about it.
   - Both groups showed significant improvements: hearing, vision, memory, grip strength.
   - Experimental group had greater improvement in manual dexterity, IQ, gait, posture, joint flexibility, reduced arthritis symptoms.
   - Participants looked noticeably younger after the study.
2. **Mindset Change and Placebo Effect**:
   - The difference between groups can be attributed to the change in mindset of the experimental group.
3. **Chambermaid Study:**
   - Chambermaids underestimated their physical activity.
   - Controlled experiment: one group was taught to view work as exercise, another did not.
   - Significant differences found in waist-to-hip ratio, weight loss, BMI, blood pressure for the experimental group.
4. **Mindset and Vision:**
   - Standard eye chart creates expectations of vision decline.
   - Reversed eye chart created a positive mindset leading to improved vision.
5. **Conditioning Improved Vision:**
   - Participants read a chapter with small font letters, found they could see better than controls.
6. **Limiting Mindsets and Accepted Theories**:
   - Negative expectations of aging lead to self-fulfilling prophecies.
   - Alternative mind-body views may enable us to see and function beyond current limitations.

## 18. Consciousness The Fifth Influence
**Theory on Role of Sensory Pleasure and Mental Joy in Behavior Optimization**

**Abstract:**
- This article explores the role of sensory pleasure and mental joy as optimizers of behavior through a theoretical consideration and an axiomatic proposal.
- Philosophers consider the human brain as a third infinite in the universe due to its complexity, which can be compared to atomic particles and the cosmos.
- Pleasure and displeasure influence consciousness to maximize actions towards pleasure.
- Affective capability of consciousness operates similarly to physical forces; it is proposed as the \"fifth influence\" or \"fifth force.\"

**Keywords:** consciousness, evolution, optimisation, force, pleasure/joy

**Introduction:**
- Blaise Pascal recognized humans as balanced between two abysses: the infinitely small of atomic particles and the infinitely large of the cosmos.
- The human phenomenon is considered an infinite complexity by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, reaching a similar magnitude to the universe and atoms.
- Infinity in common language vs mathematical definition; size of observable universe and smallest identified particles.

**The Brain and the Infinite Complexity:**
- Purpose is not to confirm or support Teilhard de Chardin's philosophical viewpoint but acknowledge his recognition of infinite complexity as a relevant feature of nature.
- Comparison between numbers with different dimensions may seem irrelevant, yet common language uses \"infinity\" more liberally than mathematicians or physicists.
- Size of observable universe and smallest identified particles; figures do not change Teilhard de Chardin's message.

**Conclusion:**
- Sensory pleasure and mental joy may optimize behavior due to their influence on consciousness, which is suggested to operate similarly to physical forces in moving the infinitely complex into action.

---

### Estimating Brain Complexity An Anthropic Perspective
**Defining Complexity in Biology**
- Gell-Mann (1944) highlighted difficulty of defining and quantifying complexity
- Comparing biological complexity to dimensions of universe and quarks is meaningless due to lack of dimension for complexity

**Estimating Human Body Complexity**
- Number of atoms in human body: no longer an acceptable estimate
- Suggested indexes of complexity: genetic code, central nervous system (CNS)
- CNS contains approximately 10^11 to 10^12 neurons organized as a single whole entity
- Each neuron has an average of 10,000 synapses
- Resulting number of synapses: ca. 10^15
- This is a conservative estimate; other estimates reach up to 10^16 (Changeux, 1983)
- Comparison: universe is 10^-20 billion years old, human brain complexity equals same number of minutes since the Big Bang

**Complexity Beyond Synaptic Transmission**
- Neurotransmitter vesicles operate as quanta of synaptic transmission
- Number of vesicles in a synaptic button: variable but estimated conservatively at 10^2
- Final complexity estimate: 10^17 (10^15 synapses * 10^2 neurotransmitter vesicles)
- This figure illustrates brain complexity, other criteria provide similar or higher magnitude (e.g., Penrose's 10^24 operations per second)

**Anthropic Principle and the Motor of Action**
- Discussed question: what moves this infinite complex, the human brain?
- Brain is locus of second emergence in evolution after matter, life, and thinking/consciousness
- Human brain is most advanced known thinking complexity
- Focus on sensation and consciousness in the following discussion.

**The Philosophers' Perspective on Pleasure and Motivation**
- Mankind seeks pleasure and avoids pain as natural motivators (Ecclesiastes, Aristotle, Condillac, Bentham, Dostoievski)
- William James considered pleasure a natural motivation in psychology
- Seeking pleasure and avoiding displeasure explain human behavior, not brain function.

---

### Pleasure as the Common Currency in Behavioral Optimization
**Physiological Role of Pleasure in Sensation and Consciousness**

**Starting Point:**
- Observation that sensory pleasure tags useful stimuli for optimal physiological functioning and survival; opposite for noxious stimuli.
- Model of sensation as a multidimensional event with four dimensions: quality, intensity, affectivity (pleasure/displeasure), and duration.

**Sensation and Consciousness:**
- Sensation represents a mental representation of a stimulus that reaches a sensory organ.
- The third dimension, affectivity (pleasure/displeasure), indicates the potential usefulness or survival value of the stimulus.

**Physiological Adaptations:**
- Thermoregulatory behavior: warm feels pleasant when hypothermic and unpleasant when hyperthermic.
- Food intake regulation: pleasure occurs from food stimuli for hungry subjects, displeasure for satiated ones.
- Similar equations describe thermal preference, autonomic regulatory responses, evaporative heat loss, or chemical thermogenesis.
- Adaptation of sensory pleasure and displeasure to physiological needs, not just core temperature but difference T set-T core (error signal).

**Common Currency:**
- Ethologists postulate a common currency within the brain-mind for ranking motivations by order of priority.
- Pleasure/displeasure is proposed as this common currency based on its role in optimizing behavior from a physiological perspective and survival improvement.

**Confirmation:**
- Experiments confirmed that subjects maximize algebraic sums of pleasures/displeasures in conflicts involving motivations with physiological functions like temperature regulation, fatigue from muscular exercise, or purely mental motivations.

---

### Evolution of Consciousness Joy and Pleasure as Common Currency for Decision Making
**Role of Pleasure and Displeasure in Behavior:**
1. **Pleasure Maximization**: Humans and animals make decisions based on maximizing the algebraic sum of pleasures/displeasures experienced simultaneously in sensory and mental modalities (Cabanac, 1992).
2. **Common Currency for Motivations**: The brain needs a common currency to rank motivations for accessing the behavioral final common path in a time-sharing pattern (McFarland & Sibly, 1975; McNamara & Houston, 1986).
3. **Pleasure as Common Currency**: Since behaviors with physiological goals compete with other motivations, pleasure is the common currency that tags usefulness and orients behavior (Cabanac, 1992).
4. **Joy and Consciousness**: The affective axis of consciousness evolved from sensation, inheriting its properties. Joy acts as a tag for useful experiences in decision making processes (Cabanac et al., 1997; Balask et al., 1998; Cabanac et al., 2002; Ramrez et al., 2005; Cabanac & Bonniot-Cabanac, 2007; Roberts, 2004; Hudson, 2011; Perlovsky et al., 2010).
5. **Impelling Force**: Pleasure/joy is the motor of action in the human mind, possessing characteristics such as contingency, usefulness, transience, and motivating behavior (Cabanac, 1971, 1979; Warnburton, 1996).
6. **Evolutionary Advantage**: Sensory pleasure saved the nervous system from storing astronomical numbers of stimulus-response reflexes by adding flexibility to animal behavior (Cabanac, 1996). Similarly, joy saves the brain from storing an infinite number of rules and provides a formidable advantage in terms of information storage and behavioral response flexibility.
7. **Role of Affect in Guiding Evaluation and Choice**: The important role of affective factors in guiding evaluation and choice is apparent (Finucane et al., 2003).

### The Emergence of Pleasure as the Fifth Influence in Consciousness
**The Advantages of Affective Decision Process**
- Facilitates ranking of priorities
- Adds flexibility to the decision process
- Distinguishes conscious agents from algorithmic Turing machines (Penrose, 1994)

**Five Forces in Physics and the Proposed Fifth Force**
- Newtonian force: influence operating on a body to produce an alteration or tendency to alteration
- Four forces recognized by physicists: gravitational force, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force (Table I)
  - Gravitational force: weakest of all interactions but exerts influence most noticeably in the cosmos; range is infinite; affects all particles
  - Electromagnetic force: stronger than gravitational force; acts over infinite distances; interacts with charged particles only
  - Weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force: act at atomic and sub-atomic levels; cause radioactivity and nuclear reactions in star cores
  - All forces have the property to actuate bodies and particles on which they are exerted

**Proposal of the Fifth Force: The Affective Capability of Consciousness**
- Physicists hypothesized that matter was under the influence of a unified force at the beginning of the universe
- Unified force separated through symmetry breaking into gravitation, GUT (Great Unified Theory), strong and electro-weak forces, then electro-magnetic and weak forces
- Suggesting pleasure/displeasure and joy/distress operate in conscious animals similarly to physical forces influencing behavior
  * Pleasure can move the infinitely complex into action
  * No thinking brain can escape the trend to maximize pleasure/joy
- Proposed to consider the **affective capability of consciousness** as the fifth influence rather than force due to its dimensionless nature
- Experiments support the proposal as an axiom, attempting to falsify it rather than demonstrate it
- The five forces and their emergence in phylogeny may be accepted as starting to drive the world towards increasing complexity by organizing the links between individuals, forming what Teilhard de Chardin (1955) called Noosphre.

## 19. The Spread Mind Seven Steps to Situated Consciousness
**Spread Mind Hypothesis: Radical Version of Phenomenal Vehicle Externalism**

**Abstract:**
- Outlines a radical version of phenomenal vehicle externalism called The Spread Mind
- Suggests that both the content and vehicles of phenomenal experience are identical to a process beginning in the environment and ending in the cortex
- Proposes that consciousness may extend beyond the skin, making it situated in a strong sense

**Keywords:**
- Consciousness
- Phenomenal experience
- Externalism
- Time
- Ontology
- Causation
- Representation

**Physical Basis of Phenomenal Experience: The Hard Problem**
- Unresolved question about the physical underpinnings of consciousness
- Questions challenge the idea that high-level facts can be derived from low-level physical configurations and causation
- Consciousness seems unreasonable without direct experience

**Neural Activity and Phenomenal Experience: Missing Connection**
- Neuroscience research shows neural activity is correlated with conscious experience, but no theory explains the connection between them
- Other hypotheses worth considering due to lack of satisfactory explanation for conscious experience

**Internal vs. External Assumptions in Neuroscience and Philosophy of Mind**
- Neuroscientists assume physical underpinnings of consciousness must be internal to the nervous system
- Physicalist would look for any physical phenomena, not just internal states of subject
- Author will consider a counterintuitive hypothesis: The Spread Mind

**The Spread Mind Hypothesis**
- Proposes that physical underpinnings of consciousness may extend beyond the skin
- Consciousness may be situated in the environment

### Rainbow as a Phenomenal-Physical Entity
**Relation between Mind and Environment: Beyond Traditional Assumptions**
* Focus on the relationship between mind and environment beyond traditional assumptions (Varela et al., 1991; Clark & Chalmers, 1998; OReagan & No, 2001; Rockwell, 2005; Honderich, 2006; Thompson, 2007; No, 2009; Velmans, 2009)
* Embodied mind: Environment provides development of cognitive functions (Andersen, 2003; Gallagher, 2005)
* Embedded mind: Allows offloading cognitive work (Clark, 1989; Wilson, 2004)
* Extended mind: Cognitive functions extend into the environment (Clark & Chalmers, 1998; WIlson, 2004; Clark, 2008)
* Situated cognition: Focuses on cognitive skills rather than phenomenal experience (Anderson, 2003; Robbins & Ayde, 2009b)

**Phenomenal Content Extends Beyond the Brain**
* Few authors suggest phenomenal content may depend on or be constituted by the outside world (Dretske, 1996; Velmans, 2000; Lycan, 2001; OReagan & No, 2001; Honderich, 2006; No, 2009)
* Distinction between internal representations and the external world
* Examples: Sensory experience vs. properties of distant objects (Dretske, 1981, p. 165; Dretske, 1996, pp. 144-145)

**The Case for Strong Situated Consciousness: Towards Extending the Boundaries of Phenomenal Experience**
* Consider a physical phenomenon like the rainbow (Manzotti, 2006a)
* Rainbow is a physical phenomenon that cannot be defined autonomously without an observer
* Each observer has their private rainbow experience
* Traditionally considered as a prerogative of phenomenal experience
* The rainbow process requires an observer for the reflected and refracted rays to meet, forming the full spectrum. Without an observer, the rays scatter and disperse.

### Extended Consciousness in Space The Rainbow as a Model
**The Rainbow Process**
- The rainbow is a physical phenomenon, not a mental creation or sense datum
- It requires certain conditions to occur: cloud, sun, and a suitable observer
- Without an observer, the rainbow does not exist (physically)
- The rainbow cannot be pinpointed without considering the observer's position
- Rainbows are private phenomena, similar to conscious experience
- Rainbows are temporary and extend in both time and space
- Similarities between the rainbow and consciousness: private, temporary, extended

**First Step: Extension in Space**
- The rainbow is a physically extended process, from the surface of the object to the neural activity in the brain
- Neural activity itself is also extended over large distances (e.g., 20-30 meters for perceptual processes)
- Extending physical processes does not necessarily upset or contradict the idea of consciousness arising from the physical world

**The Spread Mind Suggestion**
- The spread mind hypothesis suggests that the physical underpinnings of a phenomenal experience could extend beyond the observer's brain (e.g., from the cloud to the observer)
- Extending processes over larger spatial distances (like the rainbow) does not contradict this idea, as neural activity can also span dozens of meters

---

### Temporal Extension of Consciousness and Perception Processes Rather Than Objects
**Second Step: Extension in Time**
- Consciousness may be identical with events that occur before any causal influence is exerted on neural receptors
- Temporally extended processes are required for consciousness as they do not have an instantaneous completion
- Minimum temporal threshold exists for sustained neural activity to foster consciousness (500ms)
- All physical phenomena require some time to complete, including macroscopic processes like gestures or oxidation

**Third Step: Objects but Processes**
- Rainbow as an example of coupling between external world and neural activity is a process, not an object or mental construct
- Fields of view, sounds, chairs, faces, tactile patterns, tastes, smells, colors are observer-dependent wholes
- Targets of experience are made up of collections of physical phenomena that exist due to interaction with the observer's body and brain
- Negative answer to whether faces exist without someone capable of recognizing them
- Colors not an absolute perception but a complex integration of separate aspects like spectral composition, received wavelength, texture features.

---

### Perception as Wholesome Processes
**The Spread Mind: A Radical Physicalist View**

**Understanding Reality and Consciousness:**
- Not everything perceived is a whole (Manzotti, 2009)
  *Process* with completion in the beholder's brain
- Not idealism or dualistic ontology
  *Experience as dynamic physical process*

**Tree Falling in the Forest**:
- Negative answer like in idealism but explanation is different
- Sounds are complex physical processes
  *Beginning in tree crash, ending in someone's brain*
  *Partially external and physical*
  *Constituted by the beholder's brain*

**Macroscopic Wholes vs Basic Entities**:
- Our experience is not made of atoms or energy waves
- Requires suitable ontology based on processes rather than individuals

**The Role of Processes in Physical World**:
- Basic entities like atoms and energy packets are not what we're aware of
- Suggestion: Consciousness may help understand the structure of physical reality
  *World made up of basic stuff and processes*

**Faces as Processes**:
- Atoms alone do not make a face
- Require suitable conditions, like human subject capable of recognition

**The World We Experience is Made of Processes:**
- Not saying body or brain creates its world
- World we experience is made of physical processes requiring both environment and perceiver's body.

---

### Unity of Physical and Phenomenal World Sensory-Motor Contingencies
**The Spread Mind Theory: Identity Between Representation and Reality**

**Key Concepts:**
- The Spread Mind suggests there is only one chair - process occurring, not separate physical, neural, and phenomenal chairs
- Representation and represented object may be identical, challenging the assumption of separation in philosophy of mind, psychology, neuroscience
- Identity does not make literal sense but may simplify description of causal entanglement between subject and object
- Consciousness is situated in the environment, made up of processes that create the world we experience.

**The Problem with Representation:**
- Separate representation as an assumption begs the question
- Center of mass a useful concept but does not correspond to anything physical
- Identity suggested as solution to issue of representation

**Challenges to Identity:**
- Hard to swallow that perception is identical with what's perceived
- Assumption of separate representation is entrenched in philosophy and cognitive science

**The Spread Mind's Perspective:**
- Reconsidering conscious experience and the physical world
- Suggests identity as solution to representation issue
- Consciousness is a situated, spread physical phenomenon.

**Color Perception:**
- Physical world does not match phenomenal experience in some ways (quality, perspectivalness, unity)
- One of the better accounts considers sensorimotor contingencies between surfaces, reflected light, ambient light, and observer's perceptual skills.

**Advantages of the Spread Mind Theory:**
- Phenomenal experience might not entail emergence of unexpected phenomenal world or character from physical world
- Unity may be consciousness, resulting from processes that create wholes out of simpler parts.

---

### Conscious Experience and the Spread Mind
**Consciousness and Physical Presence**

**Macroscopic Difference with Consciousness**:
- Seeing a room: processes take place and act as a whole due to consciousness
- Without consciousness, these processes would remain isolated
- Unconscious awareness of the room is a sign of lack of conscious experience

**Room vs. Conscious Experience**:
- Room without perception is scattered collection of processes
- Consciousness allows occurrence of larger process, permitting components to act as a whole
- Occurrence of conscious experience and room are identical in terms of aspects of reality and location

**Sixth Step: World and Body in Time**

**Conscious Human Subject**:
- Each moment of consciousness corresponds to the occurrence of a world (specious present)
- Not phenomenal world, but physical world with subject's body at center

**Two Bodies to Consider**:
- Traditional body: defined by skin boundaries
- Spread Mind: made up of processes identifying the subject's consciousness
- Identical with the environment, our experience, and subtle subject instantaneous body

**Seventh Step: Every Thing is Perception**

**Approach to Counterexamples**:
- All phenomena are cases of perception
- Dreams, mental imagery, hallucinations: uninterrupted causal chain from past encounters to present moment
- Physical processes occur during these experiences, identical to the experience itself.

---

### Consciousness and the Spread Mind Beyond Brain and Body Boundaries
**The Spread Mind Theory**

**Comparison with Postponed and Scattered Perception**:
- Dreaming and memory may be cases of postponed and scattered perception
- When one dreams X, they are perceiving X
- Possibility of experiencing \"non-real\" events like conversation or flying pink elephant
- Short processes (like 30ms) should not be more scientifically respected than long ones

**Causal Entanglement and Consciousness**:
- Processes may become part of consciousness due to proper causal entanglement
- Dream content is conservative, reassembling previous perceptual experiences
- No known law limiting legitimacy to relatively short processes

**Physical Continuity and Perception**:
- In everyday perception, causal processes are constrained by proximal surroundings
- When proximal causal strength diminishes (e.g., sleep or intoxication), past events may be unified into a whole
- Temporal lag between external causes and neural endings in normal perception

**Falsifiability and Verification**:
- Spread Mind theory is falsifiable, as it makes predictions about conditions for consciousness occurrence
- Requires any phenomenal content to be explained as actual perceptions of the external world
- Amenable to empirical verification through testing against alleged counterexamples like phosphenes or direct cortical stimulation.

## 20. Consciousness Vectors
**Consciousness and Continuity**

**Introduction:**
- Defining feature of consciousness: continuity
- Lack of continuity leads to disruptions in experience
- Philosophical zombies and biological computers without sentience as examples
- Concept of separating information processing from awareness demonstrated through masking experiments

**Continuity vs Discontinuity:**
- Lower state of continuity: gaps between thoughts affect flow, impact on reading
- Complete loss of continuity: frozen memories without direction or meaning

**Implications:**
- Informed by past but unable to move forward
- Biological computers without sentience

**Philosophical Zombies:**
- Proposed concept by David Chalmers (1996)
- Human appearance without awareness

**Masking Experiments:**
- Separation of cognition and awareness demonstrated through complex masking paradigms
- Accuracy of identifying target statistically the same, but subjective assessments significantly different.

**Continuous Process:**
- Output of cognitive processing transferred into consciousness continuously or seemingly continuously
- Normal limit for information transfer: speed of light, not instantaneous.

### Discontinuity of Consciousness A Quantum Hypothesis and Alternative Explanations for Continuity Illusion
**Continuity and Consciousness:** Discontinuous Nature and Sense of Continuity
- **Experience of continuity is an illusion** (Libet et al., 1964; Libet et al., 1967; Libet et al., 1991; Castiello et al., 1991)
- Delay between sensory perception and conscious awareness: approximately 250ms (Koch, 2004b)
- **Consciousness is discontinuous**
- Discrete cycles of cognition: roughly 4 per second
- Open questions regarding consciousness vectors: tracking magnitudes and directions of changes in parallel/aggregate, qualitative information.

**Sense of Continuity:** Consciousness Vectors
- Analogy to motion vectors in vision (Shipp et al., 1994; Zihl et al., 1983; Zihl et al., 1991)
- Calculation of motion vectors: difficult to determine, subject of decades of debate (Born & Bradley, 2005)
- Identifying calculations for consciousness vectors may provide insights into modeling complex data.

**Change and Awareness:** Necessity for Conscious Feedback
- **Conscious feedback is slow** (approximately 250ms)
- Fast events occur before reaching consciousness, making awareness impossible
- **Conscious feedback is subtractive**: tracks what has already happened, preventing introduction of new ideas
- Practical benefits: allocating more energy to new information and deeper understanding of human brain function.

**Discussion:** Implications of Understanding Consciousness Vectors
- Unlocking human consciousness through deeper knowledge of brain functions
- Potential applications in artificial intelligence.

## 21. Gaia Universalis
**Universality of Consciousness: Life as a Principle**

**Key Points:**
- Life relies on principles of Continuity and Simplicity
- Can we apply these principles to consciousness?
- Summarized as: consciousness is a property and manifestation of life, life is universal in principle, consciousness is in principle universal.

**Consciousness and Self-Awareness**
- Consciousness is the focus of epistemology
- Cartesian \"cogito ergo sum\" only addresses self-awareness, not universe connection
- Experience as a starting point for understanding consciousness

**Evolution of Brain and Abstract Thought**
- Human brain adapts to planet Earth's environment
- Developed abstract thought, symbolism, metaphysics with the aid of gene mutations

**Consciousness Beyond Nervous Systems: Rhizome Concept**
- Humans genetically connected to all living organisms
- Living world as a rhizome: fully connected network
  - Each organism embodies a specific genotype
  - Connected to parental and potential offspring genomes
- Dangers of Postmodern thought, but evocative metaphor for understanding interconnectedness.

---

### Chemical Origins and Principles of Life
**The Living Network and the Definition of Life**

**The Living Network**:
- A unit in time and genetic-space extending back to the Last Universal Common Ancestor(s)
- Individuals were not distinct entities before this, but were immersed in the \"swamp of combinatorial biochemistry\"

**Critique of the Definition of Life**:
- The accepted definition is rigid yet limited:
  - A self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution
  - This definition could include any organism, from a giraffe to an alga to a bacteria or even a virus
- Limitations of the Definition:
  - **Process vs. System**: Life is a process, not a system
  - **Evolution as a Necessary Property**: Evolution may not be necessary in all definitions of life
  - **The Concept of Emergence**: Cycles and self-organization were key to the formation of life before LUCA

**The Standerd Principles for Life**:
1. **Continuity**: The momentary suspension of entropy as dictated by the second principle of thermodynamics
2. **Simplicity**: The prerequisite for life is the presence of the four most abundant elements: H, C, O, and N
3. - **Organization**: Life involves the organization of matter, energy control, and directional flow of chemical information
4. **Cooperation**: The three \"Firsts\" (metabolism, genetics, membranes) likely needed to emerge together rather than sequentially
5. **Adaptability**: The flexibility for life to evolve over time, without necessarily returning to a \"primitive\" state

### Universal Chemical Origins and Consciousness
**The Role of HCN in Biogenic Reactions and Consciousness**

**HCN as a Catalyst for Chemical Complexity**:
- The chemistry of HCN has played a pivotal role in the initiation of biogenic reactions
- Warming formamide (H2NCO) in the presence of mineral catalysts leads to a large panel of nucleic bases, acyclonucleosides, and phosphorylated nucleosides
- Non-enzymatic polymerization of cyclic nucleotides has been reported

**Penrose's Interpretation of Consciousness**:
- Penrose proposed that consciousness enables actions beyond computational activity
- It is based on subtle and largely unknown physical principles
- It is located in the domain of statistical behavior of matter, implying a mechanism in brain function

**The Relationship Between Matter and Consciousness**:
- Pauli and Jung's correspondence suggests that consciousness and matter exist in one and the same world
- Life is considered as a whole to be non-computable due to its complexity and the quantum effects involved
- The flow of life, particularly carbon-based reactions, is present everywhere in the universe

**The Observer and Anthropic Principles**:
- The observer cannot observe physical entities without interfering with them
- The anthropic principle suggests that our existence in this universe is because of its properties being suitable for our existence
- This supports the idea that life and consciousness are two aspects of a larger phenomena encompassing the whole universe

## 22. What Consciousness Does A Quantum Cosmology of Mind
**Theoretical Development in Consciousness**

**Introduction:**
- Difficulty defining consciousness due to its fundamental nature
- Two distinct meanings: subjective experience (qualia) vs. verbal reporting (quid)

**Consciousness as used by Nagel and Dennett:**
- Qualis-consciousness: subjective experience, moment-by-moment awareness of internal and external experiences
- Quid-consciousness: part of inner dialogue, forming drafts for understanding the world verbally

**Importance of distinguishing between senses:**
- Crucial when considering other beings' consciousness
- Quid-consciousness can only be explored through talking with others
- Qualis-consciousness known through empathy

**Epiphenomenalism and Consciousness:**
- Epiphenomenalism: consciousness as an add-on without functional role
- Relevant to qualis-consciousness due to its non-physical nature
- Distinction lies in doing vs. being, not whether they do things or not

**Conclusion:**
- Qualis-consciousness establishes a meaningful world for doing to occur within it.
- Scientific realism posits that qualis-consciousness may be an emotional fog generated by brain processing.

### The Evolution of Views on Consciousness in Quantum Mechanics From Collapse to Cosmology
**The Changing View of Consciousness in Quantum Mechanics**

**Earlier History**:
- **Phase (a)**: Quantum Theory of Planck and Einstein: Mechanical concept of quanta, based on a conventional mechanical viewpoint.
- **Phase (b)**: Quantum Mechanics of Bohr and Heisenberg (1925): Complementarity and uncertainty principle, collapse of the quantum state through observation.
  - Von Neumann's picture: Two distinct processes: deterministic evolution under dynamics and discontinuous transition to a new state.
  - Consciousness not necessarily involved in this process, as humans were just seen as sensitive physical detectors.
- **Phase (c)**: Wigner, London, and Bauer (1939, 1983): Consciousness essential for collapse
  * Quantum state of the human brain coupled to microsystem state through observation
  * Human consciousness collapses joint state of observer, apparatus, and microsystem
  * Limited role for consciousness: could not determine quantity being measured or bias probabilities
  * Consciousness demanded a definite outcome rather than a mixture or superposition
- **Phase (d)**: Focus on quantum-classical distinction
  * Decoherence averages out quantum states in the apparatus, resulting in a classical state
  * Role of consciousness became regarded as superfluous by this time

**Recent Clarifications**:
- Consciousness and the role it plays have remained obscure until recently.

**Cosmology Perspective**:
- Quantum cosmology highlights the need for something like consciousness:
  - Universe started in a perfectly smooth, homogeneous state
  * Fluctuations observed in WMAP satellite observations indicate deviations from this uniformity
    * These fluctuations led to the formation of stars, galaxies, and eventually humans who made observations
- Problem of quantum observation lies at the heart of modern cosmology:
  - Conventional theory states that these early fluctuations were caused by observations made by people and instruments like WMAP.
- The mathematical formalism of quantum theory alone is insufficient to fully explain this process.

---

### Quantum Cosmology and Consciousness Bridging Physicality and Awareness
**Key Concepts:**
- **Homogeneous Universe**: Without additional ingredients, the universe would remain homogeneous and sterile.
- **Quantum Cosmology**: Two ideas from quantum cosmology are needed to make sense of this: Hartle's interpretation of observations and Page's focus on sensation.
- **Observations in Cosmology**: Hartle examined probabilities of sets of outcomes for any collection of observations scattered throughout the universe in space and time. No need to consider collapse or causality between future and past events.
- **Consciousness Role**: Page argued that a cosmological theory should explain the universe as we see it, equivalent to requiring that the quantum state assigns non-zero probability to conscious sensation. Consciousness filters the state, selecting a component compatible with our capacity for sensation.
- **Unity and Coherence of Thing**: A consciousness-carrying thing must have internal unity rather than being an arbitrary aggregate of objects. Its parts are in quantum entanglement, and it is maximal with respect to this coherence.
- **Consciousness Logic**: Consciousness brings creativity along with rational deduction through its own sort of logic (structure of an algebra of propositions). Raises the possibility of a rigorous theoretical framework for para psychology.

**Key Findings:**
1. The universe arises from the interplay of a background homogeneous quantum cosmology with possible networks in space and time of instances of consciousness.
2. Self-contradictory networks of awareness are ruled out due to their zero probability assigned by quantum mechanics.
3. Consciousness does not alter the quantum state of the universe but filters it through its own logic, selecting a component compatible with our capacity for sensation.
4. A thing with consciousness must have internal unity and be maximal with respect to this coherence at the quantum-classical boundary where observation is not yet determined by decoherence.
5. Several candidates for the logic of consciousness are available, allowing us to understand how it brings creativity along with rational deduction.

---

## 23. The Stream of Consciousness
**The Stream of Consciousness**
- William James, PhD, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, first published in \"Psychology\", Chapter XI, 1892

**Methodological Approach**:
- The author adopts the **analytic method** rather than the synthetic method to study consciousness.
- He argues that starting with simple ideas of sensation and building up higher states of mind has limitations:
  - Exposes one to illusion about the nature of higher states of consciousness
  - Begins with abstract, unrelated units instead of concrete, familiar experiences

**Consciousness as a Process**:
- The author identifies four fundamental characteristics of consciousness:
  1. **Every state tends to be part of a personal consciousness.**
  2. **Within each personal consciousness, states are always changing.**
  3. **Each personal consciousness is sensibly continuous.**
  4. **It is interested in some parts of its object and rejects others, choosing among them.**
- These characteristics are complex and require further explanation, which will be explored in later chapters.

**The Personal Self**:
- The author notes that thoughts and feelings belong to personal minds or selves.
- There is no direct access to another person's thoughts; each consciousness is isolated and belongs to a specific individual mind.
- This \"absolute insulation\" of personal minds makes it challenging for psychology to understand the nature of consciousness.

---

### Persistent Change of Consciousness and Sensation
**Psychology and Sensation:**

**Importance of Individual Selves**
- Psy chology should not diminish worth of selves based on interpretation of their nature
- Consciousness is in constant change
- No state of mind lasts forever, each has unique characteristics

**Sensations and Objectivity**
- Sensations from same object may seem similar but are never identical
- Realities, physical and ideal, appear consistently leading to misconceptions
- Our focus is on the sameness of things rather than their exact sensations

**Inability to Judge Sensation Identity**
- Testimony about subjective identity questionable as proof of fact
- Difficulty in determining identical sensations due to external factors and individual perception
- Emotion towards objects changes with age, health, and environment

**Brain and Consciousness Connection**
- Every sensation corresponds to a cerebral action
- Immutable brain necessary for identical sensation to recur is impossible
- Each thought of an object is unique and different from previous thoughts about it.

---

### Continuous Consciousness and Sudden Contrasts in Thought Streams
**The Nature of Consciousness: Continuity and Change**

**Changes in Perspective:**
- Things seen in new lights
- Unreal things become real, exciting becomes insipid
- Friends shrink to shadows, women divine become common
- Pictures empty, books less significant

**Continuity of Thought:**
1. No two ideas exactly the same
2. Theorically important to consider consciousness as continuous
3. Difficult but necessary to carry out in detail
4. Impossible to follow Lockian or Herbartian schools
5. Symbolic language used, no direct representation of reality
6. Thought is sensibly continuous within a personal consciousness
7. No breaches or interruptions in consciousness
8. Past thoughts belong to the present self
9. Present thought possesses warmth and intimacy
10. Community of self not broken by time gaps

**Continuity vs. Contrast:**
- Continuous consciousness does not appear chopped up
- Stream of thought or subjective life metaphor used
- Sudden contrasts in quality of segments of stream of thought
- Loud explosion rends consciousness, but awareness of previous silence still present.

---

### Substantive vs Transitive Mental States Introspective Difficulty and its Consequences
**Substantive and Transitive States of Mind**

**General View of Consciousness**:
- Different pace of its parts, like a bird's life: alternation of flights and perchings
- Rhythm of language expresses this, with every thought expressed in a sentence and closed by a period

**Substantive Parts (Resting Places)**:
- Usually occupied by sensory imaginations
- Can be held before the mind for an indefinite time
- Contemplated without changing

**Transitive Parts (Places of Flight)**:
- Filled with thoughts of relations, static or dynamic
- Tend to lead from one substantive conclusion to another
- Difficult to observe introspectively due to their transient nature
- Introspective analysis is challenging, like trying to seize a spinning top or turn up the gas quickly

**Consequences of Failure to Register Transitive States**:
- **Sensationalists**: Denied the existence of relations and other mental states beyond sensations
- **Intellectualists**: Claimed that such feelings do not exist, and are known by an actus purus of Thought, Intellect, or Reason

**Correct Perspective**:
- If there are feelings, there must be corresponding relations between objects
- Language expresses these relations through phrases like \"feeling of and,\" \"feeling of if,\" etc.
- The substantive parts alone have become so ingrained that language refuses to recognize the existence of transitive states

---

### The Evolving Nature of Consciousness and Mental States
**The Pulses of Change:**
- Violent pulses of change occur more frequently in some places than others
- Rhythm of change is faster at times, followed by periods of stability
- Rearrangement in brain results in forms lingering for different durations
- If consciousness corresponds to rearrangement itself, why does it cease if rearrangement stops?
- Lingering rearrangements bring distinct types of consciousness

**Unnamed Modifications of Consciousness:**
- Transitive states are as important and cognitive as the lingering ones
- Examples: waiting, looking, recalling a forgotten name
- Gap in consciousness during recall attempts is intensely active and unique to each word or name
- Intention to say something before saying it is a distinct state of consciousness

**Premonitory Perspective Views:**
- A third of our psychic life consists of these rapid, premonitory perspective views
- Reader's ability to emphasize words correctly in reading aloud depends on understanding grammatical construction and anticipating the coming sentence
- Reinstatement of vague or inarticulate ideas into their proper place is essential for a complete understanding of mental life.

---

### The Fringe of Relations in Consciousness Cognitive Function and Overtones
**Psychic Fringes and Overtones**

**Consciousness as Water**:
- Every definite image in the mind is steeped in the \"free water of consciousness\" that flows around it
- This free water includes the sense of the image's relations, near and remote, its origins, and its destination
- The significance and value of an image is in this halo or penumbra of relations around it, which is fused with the image itself

**Cerebral Conditions of the Fringe**:
- The consciousness of this halo of relations around an image can be symbolized as neural processes with distinct time profiles:
  - Processes for past (whence), present (current thought), and future (whither) are all active at different levels, blending and altering each other
- This is similar to the concept of overtones in music, which blend with and alter the fundamental note

**The Topic of Thought**:
- The difference between \"mere acquaintance\" and \"knowledge about\" a topic is largely due to the presence or absence of psychic fringes:
  - **Knowledge about**: Knowledge of the relations and context of the topic
  - **Acquaintance**: Limited to the bare impression of the topic, with awareness of its relations only in a \"nascent, unarticulated way\"
- The sense of \"affinity\" or \"congruence\" between words is an important part of these psychic fringes
- Even when thinking in visual or other images rather than words, this feeling of affinity and direction towards the topic is key to rational thought

---

### Perception and Selective Attention in Thought Processes
**The Feeling of Rationality vs. Meaning**
- The feeling of rationality is more a negative absence of shock or discord, rather than a positive thing.
- If words belong to the same vocabulary and grammatical structure, meaningless sentences can still be uttered in good faith and pass unchallenged.
- Illustrations include prayers at meetings, penn y-a-line-isms, and newspaper reporter flourishes.
- The importance of mental imagery is in the \"halting-places\" or substantive conclusions, not the feelings of relation between terms.
- Differences in mental processes, such as visual vs. tactile, can lead to different but convergent thought processes.

**Consciousness and Attention**
- Consciousness is more interested in one part of its object than another, and selectively chooses what to pay attention to.
- The phenomena of selective attention and deliberative will are examples, but attention is constantly working even in everyday operations.
- Senses are organs of selection that pick out certain movements from the infinite chaos of physics.
- Attention then further selects certain sensations as worthy of notice and suppresses the rest based on practical or aesthetic interest.
- The mind chooses certain sensations to represent a thing truly, while others are considered its appearances based on conditions.

---

### Unique Personal Perspective and Choices in Perception and Experience
**Understanding Selection and Experience:**
* The mind chooses certain essential characteristics of objects to form genuine objectivity (color, size, distance, etc.)
* Experience is determined by our attention habits
* Four men on a European tour: one focused on picturesque impressions, another on practical details, third on restaurants and halls, fourth on subjective broodings.
* Reasoning depends on ability to select particular parts for proper conclusions
* Genius lies in choosing correctly at critical moments
* Ethics involve choice between several equally possible courses of action or interests
* Schopenhauer's argument: we all choose differently where me and not-me are concerned, but our choices shape our entire career.
* Human minds have unique interest in \"me\" and \"not-me\" parts of creation, which may be a moral riddle but is a fundamental psychological fact.

## 24. The Stream of Thought
**The Stream of Thought: The Five Characters of Thinking**

**Introduction:**
- William James introduces his study of the mind from within, starting with consciousness and thought as the foundational elements
- Criticizes traditional approach to psychology that begins with sensations as a flawed assumption
- Lists five important characters of thinking: personal consciousness, change, continuity, objects, interest/attention

**Five Characters of Thought:**
1. **Thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness**: Thoughts belong to specific individuals and cannot be accessed directly by others
2. **Within each personal consciousness, thought is always changing**: Thoughts are not static but dynamic and evolving
3. **Within each personal consciousness, thought is sensibly continuous**: Thoughts flow seamlessly from one to another
4. **Thought appears to deal with objects independent of itself**: Objects exist outside our minds and influence our thoughts
5. **Thought is interested in some parts of objects to the exclusion of others, and welcomes or rejects these parts:** We choose which aspects of an object to focus on and how to respond to them

**Preliminary Note on Personal Consciousness**:
- Defining personal consciousness is a difficult philosophical task
- Personal consciousnesses are isolated from one another, with no direct access between them
- Each mind keeps its thoughts to itself, creating absolute insulation between individuals' mental processes.

---

### The Formation and Evolution of Secondary Personalities
**Personal Selves and Secondary Personalities**
- The personal self under which thoughts appear is true for whatever further analysis
- Tendency of thoughts to appear as parts of personal selves, but not always complete or conscious
- Examples: subconscious personality traits, automatic writing, etc.
- These secondary personalities are abnormal and result from splitting a single complete consciousness into two parts
- Size of a secondary self depends on number of split thoughts, forms a personality with memory, habits, and sense of identity
- Adoption of name by the secondary self may be spontaneous or suggested
- Can take form of real or imaginary beings, influenced by social environment

**Unorganized and Impersonal Thoughts**
- Beneath organized thoughts are unorganized and impersonal ones
- Catalepsy in hysteric patients suggests there are thoughts with no consciousness
- Cataleptic trance: patient lacks memory, but can be controlled by operator or retain certain positions/movements
- Unconscious movements may be accompanied by feeling, not just physiological reflexes
- These unintelligent, unuttered thoughts tend to develop memory and form personal consciousness

---

### Perception and Sensation Identity and Variability
**The Change in Consciousness**

**Hodgson's Description**:
- Warns against focusing on specific modes of consciousness (perception, sensation, thought)
- Finds that consciousness is a sequence of different feelings
- Stresses that no state can recur and be identical to what it was before

**The Theory of Ideas**:
- Psychological science seeks to reduce complexity to simplicity
- Locke's successors believed simple ideas were the sensations strictly defined
- The view of these philosophers has been called into question

**Sameness of Sensations**:
- Common experience seems to confirm that the same sensations are always the same
- However, a close examination shows that there is no proof the same bodily sensation is ever repeated
- What we focus on is the ratio of one sensation to others rather than the absolute quality or quantity

**Changing Sensitivity**:
- The eye's sensitivity to light changes rapidly over time
- Feelings differ based on factors like sleepiness, hunger, fatigue, and age

**Feelings Reveal the Same World**:
- Despite differences in sensibility, feelings reveal the same world with sensible qualities and objects.

---

### Changing Brain States and Perception
**Sensations and Feelings**
- The brighter and exciting experiences become weary, flat, and unprofitable over time
- The bird's song becomes tedious, the breeze mournful, the sky sad
- A sensory experience corresponds to a specific cerebral action
- An unmodified feeling is an impossibility as every brain modification leads to a change in feeling

**Thoughts and Consciousness**
- Our state of mind never remains precisely the same
- Every thought we have of a given fact is unique, with differences in how it is perceived and understood over time
- We see things in new lights, and what was once exciting becomes insipid
- Experience remolds us every moment, shaping our mental reactions to things

**Brain Physiology**
- The brain changes as we think, with an internal equilibrium shifting with every pulse of change
- The precise nature of the brain shift is determined by many factors, including the accidental state of local nutrition and blood supply, and the influence of outward objects on the senses
- Every brain state is a record that reflects the owner's entire foregone history

**Conclusion**
- Total brain states cannot identical recur, as there are always differences in the intervening brain states
- The presence of certain lines in a figure changes the apparent form of others, and music alters our feeling of sounds
- The brain retains a \"soreness\" after being maximally excited, which influences present consciousness

---

### The Continuity of Consciousness No Permanent or Independent Thought Parts
**Theories of Mind Changes**
- Limitations of Lockian and Herbartian schools' influence
  - Convenient to formulate mental facts in atomistic ways
  - Mythological entities, not based on actual nature
- Influence of language on thought representation
  - Agglutinative languages better guide continuous thought conceptualization

**Continuous Thought within Personal Consciousness**
- Definition of continuity: no breach or division
- Two parts: time gaps and quality changes

**Time Gaps**
- Existence of unfelt time-gaps (consciousness may not be aware)
  * Can merge with each other, feeling unbroken for the individual
  * Example: unconsciousness from anesthetics or epilepsy
- Felt time-gaps
  * Consciousness feels as part of same self after waking up from sleep
    * Continuous in a unitary sense, as long as consciousness lasts during that day
  * Judgment of time gaps relies on inference from sensible signs

**Quality Changes**
- Sensibly continuous and one despite abrupt changes in thought quality

---

### Continuity and Discontinuity of Consciousness
**The Natural Whole: Self and Continuous Thought**

**The Common Whole: Myself, I, or Me**
- Recognition of past thoughts by present self
- Unerringly finds its way to own mate across time gap
- Warmth and intimacy in present thought

**Presence vs. Past:**
- Present is me, mine
- Knowledge of others' past states: different from remembrance
- Rememberance is like direct feeling, object is \"sufused with a warmth and intimacy to which no object of mere conception ever attains\"

**Interruptions in Thought Stream:**
- Sudden contrasts in quality of segments
- Explosions, new objects or changes create interruptions
- Transitions between thoughts: not breaks but parts of consciousness

**Clarification on Interruptions:**
- Overlooking the large amount of affinity that may remain between thoughts
- Awareness of previous silence creeps into feeling of thunder
- Language obscures perception of truth, names thoughts simply after their objects

**Body Position and Attitude:**
- Invariably accompanies knowledge of other things
- Awareness, however inattentive, always present.

---

### The Dynamics of Thought Transitive and Substantive Parts
**Understanding the Gradualness of Mental Content Change (Chapter 243)**

**The Nature of Ego and Thought:**
- The ego is a liaison between all things we become aware of as humans
- Feeling of warmth and intimacy makes our thoughts come as ours
- Uncertain if this sense has meaning beyond the feeling of the same old body

**Phenomena of Contrast:**
- In sense perception: feelings of delight or displeasure in a series of impressions
- In thought: consciousness of the whence and whither that accompanies its flows
- A new state's vibrations modify present consciousness

**Principles of Nerve Action:**
- No state of brain dies away instantly
- Modifications are commonly contrasts, as in perception and aesthetics
- Gradualness in mental content changes

**The Rhythm of Thought:**
- Alternation between resting places (substantive parts) and transitive parts
- Main purpose: attainment of another substantive part from the current one
- Difficulty observing transitive parts introspectively due to their headlong nature.

---

### Feeling of Relation and Feelings of Tendency in Unnamed States of Consciousness
**The Problem of Relations and Feelings**

**Sensationalists:**
- Deny reality of relations in and out of mind due to lack of corresponding subjective feelings
- Hume's influence: substantial psyches, sensations, and their derivatives are separate; everything else is verbal illusion

**Intellectualists:**
- Can't find distinct substantive feelings for relations but acknowledge their existence
- Relations known by something non-feeling or intellectual (Thought, Intellect, Reason) on a different plane

**The Author's Perspective:**
- Both are wrong: if there are feelings at all, there must be feelings of relation
- Human speech reveals real relations objectively and subjectively through various phrases and inflections
- Language is biased towards recognizing only substantive parts

**Brain Equilibrium and Consciousness:**
- Brain is an organ with internal equilibrium undergoing perpetual rearrangement
- Consciousness corresponds to the fact of rearrangement, not just static forms
- Slower rearrangements lead to lasting consciousnesses (sensations or images)
- Swift rearrangements bring about other types of consciousnesses (feelings of relation)

**Unnamed States or Qualities:**
- Other unrecognized cognitive states as important as transitive ones
- Sensationalists fail to find them, intellectualists acknowledge their function but deny feelings
- Examples: being told \"Wait,\" \"Hark,\" or \"Look\" can throw consciousness into a new state.

---

### Psychological States of Expectancy and Meaning
**Three Different Attitudes of Expectancy**
- Three different attitudes of expectancy: hark, look, and wait
- No definite object present in any case
- Residual conscious affect: sense of direction from which impression will come
- Psychoses have no names but \"hark, look, and wait\"

**Recalling a Forgotten Name**
- Consciousness has a gap that is intensely active
- Wraith of the name beckoning in a certain direction
- Tingles with sense of closeness and then sinks back without the longed-for term
- Gap acts to negate proposed wrong names, they don't fit the mold
- Gaps of one word are not the same as another, even when both are empty

**Namelessness is Compatible with Existence**
- Numerous consciousnesses of emptiness, no name for each
- Ordinary assumption: all emptinesses of consciousness are the same state
- Feeling of absence is different than absence of feeling
- Intense feeling, rhythm of lost word may be there without sound

**Difference Between First Taste and Recognized Familiarity**
- Strange difference between first taste and recognized familiarity
- Strong emotional power of tune, odor, flavor that brings feeling of familiarity
- Only name for all its shadings is \"sense of familiarity\"

**Logical Relationships in Speech**
- Large tracts of human speech are signs of direction in thought
- Direction we have a sense of, though no definite sensorial image plays part
- Sensorial images are stable psychic facts, can be held still and examined
- Bare verbal scheme of logical movement is a psychological transition, fleeting

**Intention Before Speaking**
- Intention of saying something before speaking has an entirely specific affection of the mind
- Distinct state of consciousness, but consists of very little definite sensorial images.

---

### The Role of Tendencies in Mental Life
**Linger and Anticipatory Intuition**

**Premonitory Perspective Views**:
- A man reading something aloud for the first time is able to emphasize words immediately
- This occurs because the reader has a sense of the coming grammatical scheme, which modifies the emphasis of each word
- Emphasis is almost entirely a matter of grammatical construction
- The reader expects certain words based on the position and context of previous words

**Tendencies as Objects of Consciousness**:
- Tendencies are not only descriptions from outside, but also objects of consciousness within
- They form a large part of our mental life, beyond just definite images
- The \"free water\" of consciousness surrounds and permeates each image, carrying the sense of its relations, origin, and future development

**Consciousness of Thought Processes**:
- Our minds carry an immense horizon of potential thoughts and associations
- When thought is fresh, we can see a wide perspective of coming ideas
- Under normal conditions, the horizon of associated thoughts is more circumscribed
- In states of mental fatigue or \"brain fog\", the horizon narrows almost to just the passing word
- The awareness that our thought has come to a stop is different from the awareness that it has been definitively completed

---

### Sensory Premonitions and Psychic Overtones in Thought Processes
**Expressions of Completed and Incomplete Thoughts**
- **Completed thoughts**: expression has a falling inflection, silence follows
- **Incomplete thoughts**: hemming and hawing or \"and so forth\" phrases, integral part of the object of thought
- Sentence completion feels different as it passes due to premonition of inability to end it

**Symbolizing Brain Processes**
- Echo of whence: likely due to dying excitement of processes a moment ago
- Sense of whither: due to waxing excitement of tracts or processes a moment hence
- **Represented by curve**: neurosis underlying consciousness must be like this at any moment
- Each point on horizontal line represents brain-tract or process
- Height of curve stands for intensity of process
- All processes present, but those before later were more intense and those after will be more intense

**Mistakes in Speech or Writing**
- Mistakes show brain processes begin to be excited before thoughts are due
- Can result from local accidents that block or further the nascently aroused processes
- Influence on thought: \"psychic overtones,\" altering and blending with present processes

**Knowledge vs. Acquaintance**
- **Acquaintance**: limited to bare impression, unaware of relations (except as fringes)
- **Knowledge about**: aware of relations, can reason based on those relations
- Difference between the two: presence or absence of psychological \"fringes\" or overtones

**The Sense of Afinity**
- Subjective stream's most interesting feature
- Involves a topic or subject that all members of thought revolve around
- Can be a problem, gap, or mood; influences thoughts based on how they relate to the topic
- Relation of harmony and discord felt in the fringe, leading to acceptance or rejection of thoughts.

---

### Semantic Associations in Language and Thought A Psychological Axiom
**Meaning of a Stream of Thought**

**Relevance and Appropriateness**:
- A train of thought is relevant if it leads to an important conclusion
- The conclusion is the \"topic\" or meaning of the stream of thought
- Relevant thoughts stand out for their peculiar interest, arresting attention and inducing substantive treatment

**Flexibility in Means**:
- The specific words or images used to reach a conclusion are less important than the overall harmony or discord they convey
- When a conclusion is reached, earlier steps can be forgotten

**Fringes of Meaning**:**
- Words and concepts gain \"fringes\" of mutual repugnance or affinity through long association with each other and the conclusion
- These fringes are felt as harmony or discord in thought

**Psychological Axioms**:
- Connections between ideas grow through association, just as geometric objects are equal to each other
- Words used as signs of related things gradually develop a connection beyond their mere sensory properties

**Strengthening Felt Relations**:
- Regular language structure strengthens felt connections among words and concepts
- Repeated use of language further embeds these associations in the mind

---

### The Psychology of Meaning in Language
**Perception of Meaning in Language:**

**Vague Sense of Belonging Together**
- Minimum perception of words belonging together is a sign of understanding
- Introducing unusual foreign words or incongruous vocabulary disrupts this sense, causing shock and lack of assent

**Rationality as Negative or Positive Concept**
- Absence of shock between terms equals rationality in some cases
- Borderline between objective sense and nonsense is hard to draw
- Subjective feeling of rationality may be strong in writer and readers

**Role of Grammar and Expectations in Meaning**
- Correct grammatical structure contributes to impression of meaning
- Nonsense with good grammar sounds half rational, while sense with poor grammar seems nonsensical

**Dynamic vs. Static Meaning of Words**
- Dynamic meaning reduces to fringe of felt suitability or unfitness in context and conclusion
- Static meaning consists of sensory images for concrete words; definitions for abstract ones

**Exceptional Cases: Extremely Deficient Visual Imagery**
- Some individuals can't create mental images, but still understand through other means like knowing or feeling.

---

### Early Childhood Ponderings Origin of Life and Universe
**The Role of Words in Thought Processes**
- Verbal images are an effective substitute for visual and gustatory memories in practical situations (e.g., ordering food, paying bills)
- Words are the handiest mental elements due to their rapid accessibility and ease of revival as actual sensations compared to other experiences
- Older, more effective thinkers often rely on words instead of visualizing power
- A deaf and mute person can develop an effective thought system using tactile and visual images

**Thought Without Language**
- Philosophers have debated whether thought is possible without language
- The author's childhood experiences as a deaf-mute demonstrate that it is possible to think and ask profound questions
- The author began asking about the origins of life, the earth, sun, moon, and stars at a young age before learning to read or write
- He believed that man and the earth were the two primary things he needed to understand, with animals being secondary in importance.

---

### The Formation and Evolution of Thought Processes
**Personal Account of Early Thoughts about the Universe's Origin**
- Believed sun went into a hole at the west and came out of another at the east, traveling through a great tube in the earth
- Stars were tiny lights studded in the sky
- Struggled to grasp the origin of the universe from an early age
- Found it beyond the capacity of my mind to comprehend fully
- Felt overwhelmed by the mystery and abandoned the subject for a time
- Continued to return to the subject, but left it unresolved after long periods of thought

**Comparison of Minds in Thought Processes**
- Differences in imagery and ways of thinking do not matter as long as the final conclusions are the same
- Feelings of relation between terms are more important than the terms themselves
- A diagram can help illustrate this concept: A is an experience, Z is a rational conclusion, thinkers follow different \"trains of thought\" with various imagery and emotions but all converge at the same conclusion.

**Importance of Algebraic Analogy in Thought Processes**
- Thought is similar to algebra, which operates on relations rather than specific values or images
- Words and ideas are blank forms until supplied with values through images and sensations
- Analysts can carry out extensive operations without translating ideas into images, like a sign for danger.

---

### Cognitive Function and Reality Perception in Thought Processes
**Ideas as Substitutions**
- Ideas are substitutions that require secondary process to replace symbolized meanings
- This secondary process is often not performed or only partially performed
- For example, when constructing a chain of reasoning, few images accompany the ideas
- Images of related concepts may be faint or absent, as they can hinder thought by introducing irrelevant connections

**Sensible Continuity in Thought**
- Between all elements of thought there is a transitive consciousness
- Words and images are \"framed\" rather than discrete as they appear

**Cognition and Reality**
- Human thought deals with objects independent of itself, possessing the function of knowing
- For Absolute Idealism, the infinite Thought and its objects are one, with objects being a product of thought
- The belief in an external reality comes from repeated experiences of sameness in multiple thoughts
- Unprecedented experiences, like new tastes, initially appear as simple beings without distinct internal or external existence
- As consciousness develops and we make judgments of sameness among objects, we corroborate the notion of realities beyond thought
- This is the psychologist's point of view: the relatively uncritical non-idealistic perspective adopted by natural science.

---

### Psychological Object Understanding the Comprehensive Nature of Thought
**Shoemaker's Experience of Ether Intoxication:**
- Vision: two endless parallel lines in swift longitudinal motion on a uniform misty background, accompanied by a constant sound or whirr
- No dreams, visions related to human affairs, ideas, impressions, emotions, or sense of self
- Lapse of subjectivity and objectivity

**Philosophers' Perspective:**
- Reflective consciousness of the self is essential for cognitive function of thought
- Thought must distinguish between object and itself to know something
- Assumption is without reason
- Knowing O or O + P as objects of knowledge is equal
- Object of thought is its entire content, not just a substantive kernel or topic

**Proper Use of Term \"Object\" in Psychology:**
- Object should refer to the actual constitution of the thought being studied, not just its grammatical object or subject
- Kernel or topic may mean more than what's present to the thought, so introspective psychology requires careful consideration.

---

### Unity of Thought One State of Consciousness
**Psychology of Thought**

**Memory and Reproduction**:
- Memory seldom accurately reproduces objects once they pass from the mind
- Can only make too little or too much of an object
- Best plan is to repeat verbal sentence, if there was one, in which the object was expressed
- Introspection cannot capture the full complexity of thoughts

**Unity of Thought**:
- Even complex objects are **one and indivisible states of consciousness**
- Thoughts should not be viewed as a bundle of separate ideas fused together
- Ego is not needed to bring ideas into relation with each other

**Psychological Fallacy**:
- When trying to describe a thought, we often focus on the appearance of its components rather than the underlying subjective experience
- The thought \"the pack of cards is on the table\" represents a **different subjective phenomenon** than the thought of the pack itself
- We cannot break down a thought into corresponding parts that match the object's physical components

---

### Understanding the Persistence of Thought Content in Verbal Streams
**The Consciousness of Thought Streams and Ideas**

**Vertical Dimentions**:
- Represents the objects or contents of thoughts
- A line vertical to any point represents the object in the mind at that instant
- A space above a horizontal line symbolizes all that passes through the mind during that time

**Psychic Constitution of Vertical Sections**:
- Immediately after 0, the entire thought is present as an intention to utter the sentence
- Before speaking, one barely knows what they intend to say, but afterwards is filled with admiration and surprise at having said it well

**Relationship Between Words and Ideas**:
- Each word in an understood sentence comes to consciousness as its meaning
- Overtones or fringes of words are present, never absent
- The same object is known everywhere, with the mind shifting from one perspective to another

**Consciousness of Idea and Words**:
- The idea (total object or meaning) and consciousness of words are consubstantial
- They are made of the same mind stuff and form an unbroken stream
- Annihilating a mind at any instant would reveal the sufusion of the word with the whole idea

**Illustration**:
- Representing the object content of a vertical section as a plane figure, with height representing relative prominence
- A series of sections over time would build up to a solid, with a cut across it at right angles showing the thought's content

---

### Selective Emphasis in Perception and Consciousness
**The Stream of Consciousness**
- A solid wooden frame with sentence written on front, time scale on side
- Spread flat sheet of India rubber over top with rectangular coordinates painted
- Slide smooth ball under rubber in direction from 0 to yesterday
- Bulging membrane symbolizes thought's content change over time
- Shows relative intensities of nerve processes corresponding to different parts of thought object

**Selective Attention and Deliberative Will**
- Always interested more in one part than another
- Welcomes, rejects, or chooses thoughts and objects
- Selective emphasis present in all perceptions
- Monotonous succession of sound strokes becomes rhythms through accentuation
- Distinctions arise from laying same selective emphasis on parts of place and time

**Senses as Organs of Selection**
- Each sense organ picks out certain movements within limits, ignoring others
- No objective justification for these distinctions in the physical world
- Senses create a world full of contrasts through attending to some motions and ignoring others

**Attention's Role in Perception**
- Attention picks out certain sensations worth noticing over others
- Studies of visual sensations Helmholtz explored include: blind spots, musc volitantes, after images, irradiation, chromatic fringes, marginal changes of color, double images, astigmatism, movements of accommodation and convergence, retinal rivalry
- Humans often unaware of which eye an image falls on
- Mind selects certain sensations to represent things truly while others are considered appearances modified by conditions
- Real form of objects is the sensation when looking perpendicularly at their center; other sensations are signs of this true sensation
- Reader perceives objects based on preferred attitude, normal size, characteristic distance, standard time etc.
- Perception involves a twofold choice: noticing significant absent associates and picking a few to represent objective reality

---

### Selective Attention and the Formation of Experience
**The Importance of Selectivity in Perception and Reasoning**

**Perception**:
- We can only experience things that we pay attention to
- Even if a thing is present thousands of times, it won't enter our experience if we don't notice it
- Experiences are shaped by our habits of attention

**Reasoning and Thinking**:
- Reasoning depends on the ability to break down the totality of an object and focus on specific parts
- Choosing the right element is key to reaching a proper conclusion
- The man of genius can \"stick to their bill\" and bring out the right element when needed
- **Reasoning** is another form of selective activity in the mind

**Art and Creativity**:
- Artists select specific items, rejecting those that don't harmonize with the main purpose of their work
- Unity, harmony, and convergence of characters give art its superiority over nature
- The ethical energy lies in choosing which interest should become supreme

**Ethics**:
- Choosing an act or path requires selecting one out of several equally possible options
- The ethical energy goes beyond mere means and chooses which higher interest to make supreme
- This critical choice decides a person's entire career

**The Mind as a Theatre of Simultaneous Possibilities**:
- Consciousness consists in comparing possibilities, selecting some, and suppressing the rest through attention
- The highest mental products are filtered from the data chosen by the faculty below
- The mind works like a sculptor extricating one statue from the mass of stone or a world from the primordial chaos of sensations

---

### Psychology of Self-Consciousness The Unity and Diversity of Conscious States
**Self-Consciousness and the Division of Consciousness**

**The Human Race's Shared Interest in \"Me\" and \"Not-Me\"**:
- Individuals select certain parts of the world to focus on and name as \"me\" or \"mine\"
- This unique interest each mind has in its own \"me\" versus the \"not-me\" is a moral riddle, but a fundamental psychological fact
- The \"neighbor's me\" falls into the category of the foreign mass, contrasting with the individual's own \"me\"

**The Unity and Variety of Consciousness**:
- Each mind dichotomizes the universe differently between \"me\" and \"not-me\"
- At a more fine level, we can trace the psychology of self-consciousness in the next chapter
- This chapter draws from an article on \"Omissions of Introspective Psychology\" published in Mind in 1884

**The Physiological Basis of Consciousness**:
- **Self-consciousness** is a fundamental fact, not just a philosophical riddle
- The brain must have some mechanism to divide the universe into \"me\" and \"not-me\"
- This division may be due to a unique combination of brain waves or states that recur at specific points

**The Unity and Dynamics of Conscious States**:
- At any moment, our consciousness consists of a sum of perceptions, reflections, or both
- Attention can be directed to certain portions of this conscious state, recognized as \"the idea present\"
- The actual result can vary based on the person or situation
- Our mental states have an essential unity, with each state being a single whole

---

### Feelings of Relation and Their Implications for Knowledge
**Feelings of Relation**

**Introduction:**
- Some philosophers argue that there is no feeling of relation between emotions or thoughts
- However, a few exceptions acknowledge the existence of such feelings
- These exceptions include Destutt de Tracy, Laromiguire, Cardaillac, Brown, and Spencer

**Definition and Significance:**
- Relation-feelings: common sense of feeling relations among ideas (similar to sensation-feelings)
- Infinitely more numerous than sensation-feelings due to the combination of ideas
- Originate in feelings of relation resulting from comparing and reasoning about them
- More varied and fertile than absolute ideas, if they exist
- Widely expressed in common speech as \"sensible difference\" or \"resemblance\"

**Arguments for Relation-Feelings:**
- De Cardaillac: feeling of relation exists when we have multiple sensations or ideas in mind
- Laromiguire: most varied and fertile human feelings due to the numerous relations between ideas
- Thomas Brown: relative suggestions, or feelings of relation, are distinct from simple perceptions
- Spencer: outward relations felt along with their terms in substantive states as well as transitive ones.

---

### Consciousness Components and Relations Between Feelings
**Characteristics of Relations Between Feelings**
- Occupy no appreciable part of consciousness
- Disappear with the feelings they unite
- Extreme brevity
- Small variety
- Dependent on the terms they link

**Distinction Between Feelings and Relations**
- A feeling proper is an aggregate of related like parts, while a relational feeling is undecomposable.
- Feeling proper: made up of like parts that occupy time or space or both.
- Relational feeling: portion of consciousness inseparable into parts.

**Relations Between Feelings and Other Consciousness Elements**
- Relation cannot exist apart from the feelings which form its terms.
- Feeling cannot exist without relations to other feelings that limit it in space or time or both.

**Mental Signs of Unfavorable Disposition Towards an Individual Due to Painful Incidents**
- Wandering preoccupation with unclear mental images
- Impression difficult to name precisely
- Persists long after incident is forgotten
- Represents the object by a peculiar, unmistakable impression.

**Mozart's Composition Process**
- Bits and crumbs of the piece come together in his mind
- Soul gets warmed to the work, and the thing grows more and more
- Spread it out broader and clearer until almost finished in his head
- Can see the whole piece at a single glance as if it were a beautiful painting or handsome human being.

### Stream of Consciousness and Language Relationships
**Mental Physiology and Sensory Perception**
* Rare feast of inventing and making in dream state
* Hearing all parts at once is best
* Dr. Carpenter's explanation differs from text
* Fringe means part of object cognized, not psychic material or oysters' beards (Maguire misunderstanding)
* Children can understand stories with unintelligible words due to rapid thinking and attention on substantive starting points, turning points, and conclusions
* Deaf mutes perceive shocks and jars despite inability to hear
* Max Mller's view: Thought and Speech are inseparable; includes symbolism or mental imagery but makes no allowance for wordless summary glimpses of systems of relation and direction.

**Association and Complex Objects**
* Association forms ideas of multiple individuals into one complex idea (acknowledged fact)
* Parts of a thought are not separate realities; each is a fresh organic unity, sui generis
* Egger's argument: We often understand words before grasping the meaning in certain cases. In normal cases, simultaneity between word and sense is obvious.

**Relation to Consciousness**
* Kant originated the view that every state of consciousness requires some knowledge of self (Ferrier, Hamilton, Mansel, Green)
* Thought or intelligence involves a minimum level of self-consciousness
* Parts of a thought cannot live outside that particular thought; they are inseparable like the parts of a soap bubble or an army idea.

## 25. Origins of Thought Consciousness Language Egocentric Speech and the Multiplicity of Mind
**Origins of Thought: Consciousness, Multiplicity, Language, and Mind**

**Consciousness**:
- Not a singularity but a multiplicity
- This multiplicity enables self-consciousness and the development of thought
- Thought originates outside of consciousness as a form of deduction and self-explanation
- Can be visual, imaginal, tactile, musical, or verbal

**Verbal Thinking**:
- Utilizes the same neural pathways and structures as spoken language
- Broca's expressive and Wernicke's receptive speech areas participate in expression and comprehension of verbal thoughts

**Egocentric Speech in Children**:
- Initially think out loud due to immature neural pathways
- By 5-6 years old, egocentric speech becomes internalized as thought

**The Multiplicity of Mind**:
- Different processes within the mind handle different forms of information
- The dominant streams of consciousness (vision and language) may not have access to all relevant information
- We remain unknown to ourselves, as the mind is a multiplicity

---

### Duality in Consciousness and Thought Internal Language and Brain Functioning
**Thinking and Listening**
- Consciousness vs. Thought: Thoughts are not synonymous with consciousness, often originating outside of it (Ghiselin, 1952; Mandler, 1975; Neisser, 2006; Neisser & Fivush, 2008; Nisbet & Wilson, 1977; Wilson, 2004).
- Developmental Origins: Initially, thinking-in-words takes place externally (Piaget, 1974; Vygotsky, 1956), indicating duality.
- Language and Thought: Thinking often takes the form of internal linguistic monologue (Joseph, 1982). Verbal thinking serves explanation or commentary (Joseph, 1982).
- Tip of the Tongue Difficulty: Awareness vs. Consciousness, indicating duality (Joseph, 1982).
- Duality in Nature of Thought and Brain Functioning: Paradoxical that thoughts are not conscious before being expressed (Joseph, 1982).
- Role of Language: Thoughts only become objects of consciousness after being organized into a train-of-thought by an aspect of the mind separate from the region experiencing it (Joseph, 1982, 1986a, 1988a; Joseph, 1999, 2000a).

**Neural Pathways and Brain Structures Involved in Verbal Thought**
- Language areas become activated during verbal thought (Kaan & Swaab, 2002; Keller et al., 2001; Paulesu et al., 1993; Petersen et al., 1988).
- Inferior parietal lobule/angular gyrus, Broca's expressive speech area in the left frontal lobe, and Wernicke's receptive speech area in the superior temporal lobe involved (Joseph, 1982, 1986a, 1988a).

---

### Developmental Stages of Language and Thought
**Lateral Surface of Right and Left Frontal Lobes**
- Control vocalization and verbal thought production
- Left frontal (Broca's area): Produces words
- Right frontal: Melody of language

**Frontal Lobes and Association Areas**
- Interlocked with posterior regions of cerebrum
- Includes Wernicke's area, angular gyrus (IPL), memory centers in temporal lobe
- Frontal lobes serve as senior executive and play significant role in searching for information

**Auditory Processing**
- Primary auditory receiving areas: Superior temporal lobe
- Once processed, signals transferred to Wernicke's area for comprehension
- Right temporal lobe comprehends environmental sounds and vocalizations
- Massive neural pathways connect right and left auditory areas

**Role of Frontal Lobes in Language Development**
- Frontal lobes responsible for organizing thoughts for explanation by auditory areas
- Wernicke's area (with IPL) provides words of language to frontal lobes
- Arcuate fasciculus connects frontal vocalization and comprehending areas through angular gyrus/IPL

**Development of Language and Thought**
- Thinking in words related to language function of brain
- Children initially externalize thoughts, later internalize with development
- Initially incapable of thinking inside head but can only understand spoken thoughts
- Pathways between producing and comprehending regions of brain must mature for word-thoughts

**Three Stages of Verbal Development**
- Three maturational stages correspond to language acquisition and development
- Leads to thinking in words or forming verbal memories.

---

### Emergence of Egocentric Speech and Its Role in Thought Development
**Linguistic Development and Vocalization in Infancy**

**Initial vocalizations:**
- Reflexive and emotional in nature
- Produced by limbic system and brainstem
- Associated with moods and emotions around 1-3 months of age

**Early babbling:**
- Replaces early vocalizations
- Onset around 4 months of age
- Repetitive, such as \"da da da\"
- Transitions related to neocortex maturation

**Late babbling:**
- Around one year old
- Coincides with first words
- Resembles actual speech but still immature
- Produced by both left hemisphere and limbic system

**Jar gon babbling:**
- Emergence around 12 months
- Precedes first words
- Social and self-directed vocalizations
- Maturation event in motor areas of neocortex

**Egocentric speech:**
- Self-directed speech
- Essential for thinking in words
- Appears around age three
- Comprises up to 40-50% of child's language
- Peaks during this period, then internalized and becomes covert.

### Developmental Stages of Egocentric Speech and Thought Internalization
**Egocentric Speech and Thought Internalization**

**Definition and Characteristics**:
- Child engages in self-directed, explanatory monologue while alone
- Oblivious to responses of others during the monologue
- Produced after completing an action
- Initially occurs only after the fact

**Developmental Stages**:
1. Egocentric Monologue (2-4 years old)
   - Child explains what they have done after completing an action
   - Dialogue between the child and themselves
2. Internalization of Thoughts (5-6 years old)
   - Child begins to explain their intentions before acting
   - Neural pathways linking brain areas mature
3. Thinking Out Loud vs. Silent Thought
   - Initially, thoughts are vocalized due to limited neural connectivity
   - With age, the child internalizes their thoughts and no longer needs to vocalize them
4. Consciousness of Actions
   - Child is initially unaware of why they perform certain actions
   - Understanding comes after the fact through language-dependent regions of the brain
5. Increasing Maturity of Neural Pathways
   - Around age 5, child begins to explain intentions before performing an action
   - This parallels the maturation of nerve fiber pathways between brain areas

**Implications**:
- Egocentric speech reflects the developmental stages of a child's mind and brain
- As neural connections mature, children transition from vocalizing their thoughts to internalizing them

---

### Evolution of Mind From Multiple Brain Regions to Consciousness
**Egocentric Speech in Children:**
- Initially external and after the fact (Piaget, 1974; Vygotsky, 1956)
- Engages left hemisphere language areas: frontal temporal lobes (Kaan & Swaab, 2002; Michael et al., 2001; Schlosser et al., 1998; Tyler & Marslen-Wilson, 2008)
- Two brains and two minds in a single head due to immaturity of interconnections between Broca's area and temporal-parietal area (Gallagher & Joseph, 1982; Joseph, 1982, 1985; Joseph et al., 1984)
- Right hemisphere initiates behavior without knowledge of left hemisphere consciousness (Gallagher & Joseph, 1982; Joseph, 1982, 1985; Joseph et al., 1984)
- Neural pathways within language areas and between right and left hemispheres develop with stages of egocentric speech internalization as silent thought

**The Mind is a Multiplicity:**
- Different regions of brain and mind speak different languages, specialized to process specific types of stimuli and information
- Neurological pathways between some mind areas are sparse or non-existent as no need for communication except through intermediary tissues like the angular gyrus (Lehmann et al., 2009; Szaflarski et al., 2006)
- IPL/angular gyrus at junction of vision, hearing, and somesthesis areas assimilates diverse associations, enabling multi-modal concepts formation
- Words cannot describe some sensations or information variables that lack auditory equivalents
- Behaviors don't require language or logical thinking to occur independently (e.g., heart rate, breathing, pupil dilation)
- Ancient brain structures like hypothalamus and amygdala may hijack rational mind without conscious participation

**Evolutionary Perspective:**
- Brain has evolved over last 600 million years with only recent development of six-layered neocortical mantle (around 100 million ago) covering ancient limbic system and brainstem
- Language-dependent aspects of consciousness began to evolve within the last 100,000 years (Joseph, 1996, 2000b)
- Ancient regions of the mind function independently of human consciousness which is not consciously accessing their workings.

---

### Multiple Minds and Consciousness in Human Brain Development
**Human Brain Development and Evolution:**
- Human brain development parallels evolution (Joseph 1996)
- Brainstem functional at birth, followed by limbic system, then neocortex
- Myelination promotes nerve transmission and stability

**Emotional Functioning vs. Language Development:**
- Emotional maturation precedes language development
- Language is an \"afterthought\" phylogenetically and ontogenetically (Joseph 1982, 1988a)
- Left hemisphere's attempt to organize behavior initiated by non-linguistic regions

**The Multplicity of Mind:**
- Brain is a multiplicity with functionally specialized regions
- Consciousness requires something separate from itself (Joseph 2009)
- Differentiated brains lead to multiple minds, enabling self-consciousness.

## 26. Consciousness A Direct Link to Lifes Origins
**Correspondence Between Induction and Consciousness: A Direct Link to Life Origins?**

**Introduction:**
- Consciousness has been studied since ancient times, moving from spiritualism to scientific understanding
- Physical science progressed from Newtonian mechanics to relativity and quantum mechanics
- Einstein's EPR paper challenged Copenhagen Interpretation and led to the discovery of quantum entanglement and non-locality
- Decades later, Aspect experiment confirmed EPR and ruled out local causality
- Emergence of decoherence gave environment a more active role in quantum mechanics
- Possible setting for bringing mind and matter together on a common platform

**Bohm's Integral Duality of Mind and Matter:**
- David Bohm proposed an undivided wholeness present in an implicate order, applying to both matter and mind
- Matter and mind seen as relative projections into the explicate order with no apparent connection
- Unbroken wholeness exists at a deeper level where mind merges with matter, akin to holographic image of brain
- Consciousness related to active ingredient of time, revealing continuous and unfolding events
- Electron is an inseparable union of particle and field, with the latter organizing the movement of the former

**Quantum Coherence in Biology:**
- Penrose suggests quantum coherence as a key ingredient in recent approach to consciousness studies
- Non-computability question addressed through environment's external influence on algorithmic system decisions
- Frohlich's coherent excitations proposed for cell membranes represent a more concrete representation of this picture.

---

### Nonlinear Energy Transfer Mechanisms in Biology
**Frohlich Excitations and Penrose-Hameroff Model**

**Frohlich Excitations**:
- Stationary state reached if energy supplied to assembled material with polar vibrational modes is sufficient to offset losses
- Coulomb interaction causes shared energy among dipoles, leading to coherent oscillations with sufficient energy supply
- Nonlinear effects reduce loss and transfer system into a metastable state where local energy is channeled into single longitudinal mode
- Requires metabolic drive and dielectric properties of materials to maintain high electric fields

**Penrose-Hameroff Model**:
- Seeks biomaterials with voltage effects and geometry favoring coupling among subunits, such as microtubules
- Early evolved cytoskeleton is the basic building block in their new perspective on nervous system function
- Functional protein conformations are correlated to collective metastable states mediated by environmental factors like electric fields, ligand binding, or neurotransmitters
- Consciousness can be partially inhibited using anesthetics that alter environmental medium and electron mobility

**Davydov's Solitons**:
- Offers a plausible mechanism for localizing and transferring order through the system (time-dependent aspects)
- Substrate for energy transfer in the cytoskeleton, similar to electrons in computers
- Objective reduction occurs in this coherent system, where the external field plays an active role

**Non-Computable Biological Systems**:
- Goedel's theorem states that with any set of axioms, it is possible to produce a statement that is obviously true but cannot be proved by those axioms alone
- Penrose claims the functioning of the human brain includes non-algorithmic processes

---

### Exploring the Origins of Life through Quantum and Magnetic Field Interactions in Biology
**Non-Algorithmic Determinism in Quantum Mechanics**

**Solitons and Energy-Information Synonymy**:
- Solitons play a vital role in today's biology, linking energy and structure
- The boundary conditions of ferred by repeating structures could have answered how energy and structure got synonymous in biology
- Penrose's thesis on non-computability for thought processes is extended to the environment as an external control

**Magnetism as a Guiding Force**:
- Magnetism exerts its influence across kingdoms of life, with natural association with quantum coherence
- A soft colloidal scaffold based on field-induced assembly of magnetic dipoles can address symmetry-broken dynamics for primordial chemical reactions
- The synonymy between structure and energy across biology makes it compelling to speculate that magnetic solitons could have been a primitive mechanism for energy transport in a natural assembly, controlled by a field

**Inductive Reasoning and Pattern Recognition**:
- Inductive reasoning by analogies matches the traditional pattern-recognition approach to biology
- Sequential induction as a measuring mode could potentially shed light on the origins of consciousness in view of the field-susceptible nature of biological matter

**Conclusion**:
- The provided essay only scratches the surface of the problem, with a huge gap that is symbolized by Whitehead's perspective on religion if one substitutes consciousness for his definition

## 27. The Evolution of Human Consciousness Reflections on the Discovery of Mind and the Implications for the Materialist Darwinian Paradigm
**Human Consciousness Evolution:** A Reflection on Mind, Culture, and Discoveries

**Introduction:**
- Modern anthropology and paleontology focus on physical lens for hominid evolution analysis
- Physical/anatomical-mind/culture correlations have limitations in understanding Homo sapiens' psychological development due to lack of demonstrable changes in anatomy (brain architecture) during the last 150,000 years
- Robust evidence for convergent evolutions and ontogeny recapitulation pathways in evolution
- Significant psychological changes in human species' history, such as language, religious sentiment, mind, and self-consciousness development, can provide insights into human fascination with origins

**Modern Evolutionary Theory:**
- Modern evolutionary theory is barely two centuries old
- 19th century views of human ancestors and extant stone age cultures considered politically incorrect today
- Understanding ancient cultures versus dismissing the concept of progress entirely is important

**Focus in Paleontology, Anthropology, and Evolutionary Psychology:**
- Darwinian evolution models dominate understanding physical brain size, brain function, behavior developments before 10,000 BC
- These approaches fail to explain emergence of most human psychological traits like self-consciousness and language

**Approach for Understanding Human Development:**
- Recognize the intimate relationship between physical and psychological evolution
- Focus on understanding psychological maturation or evolution of consciousness through art, language/literature, religion/spirituality as much as technological and economic manipulation of the physical environment.

### The Evolution of Consciousness Ontogeny and Phylogeny
**Importance of Self-Consciousness in Humans and Evolution**

**Background:**
- Newborn infants lack language and self-consciousness
- Biogenetic law: ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny
- Origins of human self-consciousness and world perception

**Self-Consciousness in Humans**
1. Human obsession with origins: universe, life, evolution, human species
2. Perceived mortality leads to preoccupations of immortality
3. Evolutionary perspective on immortality
   a. Clonal generations and species transformation
   b. Transformation and reincarnation as historical synonyms for evolution
4. Self-consciousness emerges with language and perception of the world (ontogeny)
5. Rare cases: feral children, abnormal development compromise human traits
6. Child development studies on self-referential language and emotional experience leading to cognitive understanding and meaning
7. Non-human animal experiences cannot be fully conveyed linguistically by humans
8. Misinterpretation of animal communication (e.g., apes using sign language)

**Implications:**
1. Our scientific theories change as consciousness evolves
2. Ancestors' consciousness should not be judged based on present standards
3. Perceived advanced or primitive cultures depend on context and personal bias
4. Human fascination with immortality may indicate intuitive grasp of spiritual realities.

### The Evolution and Internalization of the Soul From Homer to Socrates
**The Evolution of Consciousness and Culture**

**Ancestral Cultures**:
- Recorded experiences of coming into the world of sensory perception and physical matter
- Buried their dead, indicating awareness of mortality
- Emphasis on fundamental spiritual questions about origins and the immortality of the soul
- Children also ask these \"profoundly metaphysical\" life and death questions at a very early age (~3-4 years)

**The Discovery of Mind in Ancient Greece**:
- Greeks discovered their inner souls and individuality through sculpture, self-consciousness
- Thinking ability arises around 5-7 years old with the \"Concrete Operations\" stage
- Early Greeks used terms like thymos (motion/emotion), psyche (life), and noos (perception) to describe different aspects of the soul
- Distinction between physical body and spiritual soul led to debates about mind-body duality
- Internalization of the divine and recognition of individual responsibility allowed for greater spiritual potential but also loneliness, anger, and the \"religious tradition of the fall\"

---

### Evolution of Self-Awareness and Dualism in Human History
**Self Awareness: Dualism and the Evolution of Consciousness**

**Background:**
- Development of self awareness as a dynamic process (Rochat, 2003)
- Greek literature and myths: reality vs. intellectual analysis (Snell, Barfield, Jaynes)
  * Early Greeks didn't use abstract thought or imagination for interpretation
  * Gods and demi-gods seen as participants in human affairs

**Dualism:**
- Physical existence is an inference from psychic images (Jung, 1958)
- Dualism: act of severing world into seer and seen (Vitaliano, 2000)
  * Human awareness shifts to physical body with emergence of self consciousness

**Implications:**
- Self-awareness essential for recognizing physical existence (Jung)
- Early humans had little concept or identification with their bodies
- Psychic ties to non-physical world remained strong after emergence of self consciousness

**Evidence:**
- Abrupt emergence of sensory experience at human evolution (biology and psychology)
  * Toddler stage, Near Death and Out of Body experiences
- Difficulty explaining human consciousness through physical/anatomical evolution

**Modern Perspective:**
- Physical matter has ambiguous meaning in modern physics
- Explanations for the evolution of human consciousness unlikely to focus on strictly physical phenomena.

- Ability to feel love and form attachments also a function of the limbic system

**Neanderthal Brains**:
- Skulls suggest temporal lobe was well-developed and little different from modern humans
- Neanderthals were not very intelligent or tidy, unable to fashion complex tools

---

### Evolution of Human Brain Enlargement of Temporal and Frontal Lobes
**The Evolution of Human Brain:**
* Neanderthals had a well-developed temporal lobe with little change in their frontal lobes compared to ancient primates
* Cro-Magnon people experienced significant brain growth, particularly in the frontal lobes
* Comparison of skulls reveals that the brain has tripled in size over human evolution, with most growth occurring during Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition
* The height of the frontal portion of the skull is greater in anatomically modern humans compared to Neanderthals.

**Neanderthal Brain:**
* Posterior brain region (occipital and superior parietal lobes) slightly larger than modern human brain
* Reflected environmental requirements and active hunting lifestyle
* Occipital and superior parietal areas concerned with visual analysis and positioning the body in space
* Temporal lobes, amygdala, and hippocampus linked to emotions, spiritual experiences, and supernatural phenomena.

**Cro-Magnon Brain:**
* Significant expansion of frontal lobes compared to Neanderthals
* Enhanced executive functions, decision making abilities, and complex social behaviors.

**Temporal Lobes and Amygdala:**
* Ancient humans believed in spirits, souls, and practiced mortuary rites due to the evolution of these structures
* Temporal lobes and underlying limbic system implicated in generating religious feelings and supernatural experiences
* Amygdala enables storage and reexperience of emotional memories, as well as bizarre mental phenomena like hallucinations or dissociative states.

---

### Evolution of the Frontal Lobe The Birth of Creativity and Spirituality in Humans
**Evolution of Frontal Lobes in Humans**
* Ancestors: Archaic H. sapiens (Cro-Magnon) vs Neanderthals
* Frontal lobes underwent significant expansion and development
* Cro-Magnons had larger brains, with an average size of 1600 to 1880 cc compared to Neanderthal's 1,033 to 1,681 cc (Blinikov & Glezer, 1968; Clark, 1967; Day, 1996; Holloway, 1985; Roginskyi & Lewin, 1955; Wolpoff, 1980)
* Distinguishing characteristic: Massively developed frontal lobes
* Responsible for initiating, goal formation, long term planning, and creativity (Joseph, 1986a, 1999a)

**Comparison of Frontal Lobes Over Time**
| Species | Average Brain Size (cc) | Frontal Lobe Development |
|
---|
---|
---|
| Australopithecus | N/A | Undeveloped |
| H. Habilis | N/A | Partially developed |
| H. Erectus | N/A | Slightly developed |
| Modern Humans (Cro-Magnon) | 1350 - 1800 cc | Highly developed |

**Frontal Lobes and Evolution of Free Will**
* Cro-Magnons were the first species to exercise free will and create advanced tools, art, clothing, etc. (Joseph, 1986, 1996, 1999c, 2011b)
* Frontal lobes enabled humans to think symbolically, creatively, plan for the future, and consider consequences of actions (Joseph, 1986, 1990b, 1996, 1999c)
* Capabilities associated with frontal lobes: Selective attention, planning skills, marshalling intellectual resources, anticipating the future instead of living in the past.

**Frontal Lobe Evolution and Artistic Expression**
* Cro-Magnons created intricate cave paintings using rich colors and natural contours of cave walls (Breuil, 1952; Leroi-Gourhan, 1964, 1982)
* Depicted scenes from everyday life, often drawing animals to scale
* Art was meant for trade, religious reverence, and appreciation.

* Fossil and archaeological records reveal increasing brain size and complexity in hominids for last 2-3 million years
* Symbolic reasoning emerged specifically in the anatomically recognizable Homo sapiens
* Structural modification in the brain likely occurred as a byproduct of species evolution
* New cognitive potential released by cultural stimulus, most plausibly invention of language

**Symbolism:**
* Humans mentally disassemble world into abstract symbols to create alternative realities
* Intangible attribute that sets humans apart from other organisms
* Complex societies result from individual differences in re-creation of reality

**Understanding Human Evolution:**
* Indirect proxies for behaviors and cognitive states used through fossil and archaeological records
* Patterns of change over hominid evolution clear despite arguments and testing limitations
* Closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, provide approximate models for early hominid ancestors but are nonsymbolic.

### Evolutionary Changes and Social Organization of Early Hominids
**Very Early Hominid Cognition and Change in Human Evolution**

**Povinelli's Conclusion:**
- Very early hominids did not reason about unobservable things
- Lacked any notion of causation

**Earliest Well-Documented Hominids (3.6 to 3.0 myr):**
- Classified as Australopithecus afarensis
- Fossils from several eastern African sites
- Drying climate led to woodland and savanna environments
- Bipedal apes with broad hips, short legs, and arboreal agility
- Brain sizes and cranial proportions comparable to chimpanzees
- Expanded dietary repertoire: tough tubers, rhizomes, small mammals (hyraxes)
- Baboons and macaques as social primate comparisons for understanding their social organization

**First Stone Tools:**
- Around 2.5 myr ago
- Evidence of a cognitive leap: planning and foresight required
- Possible indications of earlier use (butchery marks on animal bones)
- Impact on diet, particularly the inclusion of animal fats and proteins

**First Modern Hominids (1 - 9 to 1.6 myr):**
- Known as Homo erectus
- Reduced faces with larger brains compared to bipedal apes
- Physically committed to open savanna lifestyle
- Increase in animal protein intake and cooking of food for nutrient availability.

### Hominid Brain Evolution and Symbolic Cognition
**Hominid Transition to Predators and Symbolic Thought**

**Possible Reduction in Gut Tissue**:
- Evolutionary trade-off for increasing brain size in genus Homo

**Domesticated Fire**:
- Beneficial for discouraging carnivorous fauna, especially at night
- Provided a physical focus and social ramifications

**Lack of Evidence for Domestication of Fire**:
- No tangible evidence before about 800,000 years ago (Goren-Inbar et al., 2004)

**Old Stone Age Technology**:
- Craftsmanship, but not symbolic behavior until the last Ice Age

**Homo Heidelbergensis**:
- First cosmopolitan hominid species
- Spread to Europe and Africa
- Developed artificial shelters, regular fire domestication, hafting of stone tools, and fabrication of javelin-like throwing spears

**Prepared-Core Tool-Making**:
- Pioneered by Homo Heidelbergensis around 400,000 years ago
- No evidence of symbolic thought processes in this species

**Symbolic Thinking and Modern Humans (Homo Sapiens)**:
- First appeared in Africa around 200,000 to 160,000 years ago
- Archaeological associations are scanty, but similar to Neanderthals' stone tool assemblages
- First signs of symbolic behavior around 75,000 years ago: geometrically-engraved ochre plaques and complex multi-stage technologies in South Africa
- Modern human anatomy predated modern symbolic behavior patterns

**Theoretical Explanation for the Emergence of Symbolic Thought**:
- Neural substrate for symbolic thought likely developed as a byproduct of the radical developmental reorganization that gave rise to Homo sapiens
- This innovation lay fallow until it was discovered through some cultural stimulus, possibly the invention of language
- Language involved creating symbols in the mind and rearranging them according to rules to generate complex statements from a finite vocabulary
- Structured language can be spontaneously invented and spread rapidly within populations predisposed for it
- Symbolic thought allowed Homo sapiens to envision alternative worlds and plan in an unprecedented manner, creating a cognitive gulf with other hominids.

## 30. Evolutions Gift Subjectivity and the Phenomenal World
**Retinoid System: Evolution and Consciousness**

**Introduction:**
- Brain mechanism responsible for subjectivity and consciousness (retinoid system)
- Proposed as evolutionary adaptation constructing our phenomenal universe
- Discusses the role of retinoid system in creating a 3D representation of the world around us

**Retinoid System:**
- Unique brain system with specific neuronal structure and dynamics
- Generates conscious experience by integrating disparate stimuli into an egocentric representation
- Comprises internal, self-organizing synaptic matrices in various sensory modalities
- Integrates multi-sensory features into a coherent global representation of 3D space

**Role of Retinoid System:**
1. Regists and appropriately integrates stimuli into an egocentric representation of the world around us
2. Organizes sensory features (color, shape, etc.) in proper spatiotemporal register
3. Provides rich content for conscious experience through reciprocal evocation among sensory images and neuronal tokens
4. Integrates signals from disparate sensory modalities into a single coherent representation of the surrounding world

**Metaphorical Description:**
- Consciousness as a theater within the brain: retinoid space is the bright stage, synaptic matrices are the critical observing audience in the dark part of the theater (unconscious)

**Evolutionary Development:**
- Emerged in lower animals and peaked with human beings
- Provides humans with a phenomenal world full of events and contingencies beyond isolated stimuli impacts on other creatures.

---

### Seeing-More-Than-Is-There Phenomenon and Its Implications for Consciousness
**Retinoid Space and Consciousness**

**Neuronal Activity in Retinoid Space**
- Contents of conscious experience are based in neuronal activity within retinoid space
- Emergence of retinoid system leads to new possibilities for adaptive action

**Quantum Events and Consciousness**
- Quantum events relevant to biophysical processes at a fundamental level
- Suggestion that quantum events conform to the structural and dynamic properties of the retinoid system
- Modern science is a product of biological constraints from human brain consciousness

**Retinoid System: Phenomenal World Representation**
- Organized around fixed cluster of neurons (core self)
- Current content of conscious experience is based on patterns of neuronal excitation in retinoid space

**Consciousness Definition**
- Transparent brain representation of the world from a privileged egocentric perspective
- Sensory modalities contribute to phenomenal experience, even for blind individuals

**Seeing More Than Is There (SMTT) Experiment**
- Demonstrates consciousness as complementary relationship between neuronal mechanism and phenomenal experience
- Subject sees more than actual visual stimulus when narrow aperture fixated on computer screen
- Perception corresponds to the veridical optical projection of the state of the world.

---

### Perception and Attention in Retino-Id Space
**Experimental Findings from Visual Illusion Experiment:**
* Subjects report seeing a tiny stable line segment and vertically oscillating line above it when frequency of horizontal oscillation is less than 2 cycles/sec.
* At around 2 cycles/sec, subjects perceive a complete triangle moving horizontally instead of the small line segments.
* As frequency increases, length of base decreases while height remains constant.
* Subjects can adjust perceived base-height equality by turning knob counterclockwise or clockwise.
* Demonstrates brain's ability to construct analog representations and track relational properties of external world.

**Self-Locus (I.):**
* Movement of excitatory source of self-locus (I) into retinoid space results in selective attention.
* Preferential priming and faster response times for cells within the region of interest.
* Heuristic self-locus traces represent unimpeded travel routes, barriers or cognitive maps for various purposes.

**Creativity:**
* Human brain capable of modeling all conceivable worlds and external expressions through arts and sciences.
* Retinoid system with long-term memory and synaptic matrix enable creative modeling.
* Detailed description of neuronal design given in T rehub (1991).

---

### Retinoid System and the Science of Consciousness
**Self System (Rehub 2007)**
- **Retinoid space**: Neurons at the \"self-locus\" anchor the I-token to the retinoid origin of egocentric space
- I-token has reciprocal synaptic links to sensory and cognitive processes
- Damage to neuronal mechanisms below the dotted line leads to cognitive impairment
- Interruption of synaptic link between self-locus neurons and I-token results in loss of consciousness
- Previously learned images/layouts can be recalled and recombined by retinoid system to form novel images or models
- Content of retinoid space includes imaginative constructions as well as veridical environment information
- External expressions of novel objects/events are creative productions
- Conscious brain constructs world of experience by integrating sensory patterns, images, and memories in retinoid space
- Retinoid mechanisms can create phenomenal representations of new objects/events by rearranging excitatory neuronal patterns
- Analytic cognitive mechanisms evaluate novel retinoid images for practical or theoretical utility

**Bridging Principle and Implications**
- Bridging principle: For any conscious content, there is a corresponding analog in the biophysical state of the brain
- Application led to successful predictions about subjects' conscious experiences in SMTT experiment
- Retinoid theory can explain other subjective phenomena like moon illusion, size constancy, and motion aftereffects (see Trehub 1991)
- Ability to explain human creativity lends credence to theoretical model
- Implications extend understanding of source of scientific concepts and contribute to weak anthropic principle
- Challenge: Pursue scientific challenge of formulating alternative, superior explanations for subjectivity and phenomenal world.

## 31. Prehistoric Astronomers Ancient Knowledge Created By Modern Myth
**Upper Paleolithic Achievements and Astronomy in Europe**

**Background:**
- European Paleolithic art: significant appearance around 30,000 BC
- Upper Paleolithic era has greatest number of artifacts
- First studies on astronomy's role started in the 1970s (Alexander Marshack)

**Carved Bone Artifacts and Calendars:**
- Early objects attracting researchers
- Interpreted as notational systems based on lunar or solar motion
  * Abri Blanchard bone plate: serpentine form representing moon positions
  * Francesco d'Errico's methodology: database investigation into complex codes
    * Artifact from cave T (France) might depict parts of a code
- Frolov's claims: early communities used these objects as calendars following lunar and solar paths

**Additional Interpretations:**
- Abstract decoration on small objects interpreted as calendaric notation
- Large rock surface at Abri de Laussel (France): human figures with bison horns
  * Number 13 assumed to relate to the moon, connection between menstrual cycle and lunar periodicity.

**Alexander Marshack's Influence:**
- Significant impact on Paleolithic research direction
- Still influencing scientific circles today despite criticism in the late 20th century.

### Paleolithic Sky Lore and Constellation Interpretations
**Paleolithic Calendars and Constellations**

**Background:**
- Claim of a notational system found in Upper Paleolithic period (around 27,000 years ago)
- Lack of clear evidence for calendar use based on Marshack's classification

**Critique:**
- Notational system may have been manipulated by researcher
- Distinctive features necessary for calendric purposes not present in artifacts
- Marks too small and indistinguishable without aid of tools
- Question if there was a need for hunter-gatherers to use calendars

**Paleolithic Sky Lore:**
- Ancient peoples populated sky with mythical creatures and heroes
- Researchers study sky lore through art history, anthropology, archaeoastronomy
- Inspired by Hall of Bulls in Lascaux Cave (approximately 15,000 years old)

**Interpretations:**
- Michael Rappenglck's theory: Paleolithic shamans used cave paintings to represent constellations
  - Triangle of three bright stars forming a triangle around North Pole
  - Shaman figure serves as reference line, bird-headed shaman stick points to North Pole
- Other interpretations include representations of the Pleiades and Moon cycle in various drawings.

---

### Prehistoric Origins of Constellations in Europe
**The Origin of Constellations**

**Compact Star Clusters**:
- Found in many cultures with different names
- Shapes: oblong (e.g., Mesopotamian boundary stones, seals) or circular (e.g., Skidi Pawnee map)
- Six-dot-circular group on Bronze Age Nebra disc likely represents the Pleiades

**Cueva El Castillo, Spain**:
- Human hands painted on walls, 13,000 years old
- Semicircle of seven points beside a hand may represent Northern Crown constellation (CrB) in lower culmination
- Researcher suggests it signals how to find the North Pole's position and direction in the sky

**Origins of Constellations**:
- One of the most discussed topics in Western astronomy
- **Eudoxus of Cnidus**: First known Greek description of classical constellations, around 370 BC
- **Aratus of Soli**: Wrote Phenomena (270 BC), some parts believed to date from 1000 years earlier
- Greek system assumed to have developed gradually and from multiple traditions
- Mesopotamian list of stellar constellations (e.g., zodiacal signs, associated constellations) adopted by Greeks around 500 BC
- Some Eudoxus constellations shown to be non-Mesopotamian or pre-Greek origin

**Prehistoric Europe**:
- Interest in the night sky stimulated by rites related to initiation or vision quests
- Constellations represented heroic actions, helping participants remember storylines
- Many communities had different constellations based on cultural heroes
- Some common star groups (e.g., Great Bear, Orion, Milky Way, Pleiades) recognized across cultures
- **Bear Son Tales**: Oral tradition found in all European languages, suggesting shared stories and performance art
- Basque region's astral counterparts of half-human, half-bear hero included northern and southern constellations

**Purposes of Constellations**:
- Reference points for seasons and time
- Aid in navigation (land and sea)
- Long process, with origins reaching far back into human history

---

### Cave Art and Astronomy Interpreting Paleolithic Depictions
**Characteristics of Identification of Palaeolithic Constellations**
- Dating based on assumption that figures are true representations of constellations in Paleolithic period
- Position and size of hypothetical astral depictions assumed to be directly equivalent to real arrangement
- Size of dots believed to correspond to brightness of stars
- Coincidental correspondences between animal or human figures and classical star map

**Arguments Against Identification of Palaeolithic Constellations**
- Depictions of aurochs with nearby dots not necessarily coincidental (e.g., Lascaux cave, Iberian caves)
- 10,000-year time gap between classic and hypothetical Paleolithic analogue constellations
- Assumption of cognitive continuity unsupported as no evidence for similar depictions from Neolithic/Bronze Age discovered yet
- Contexts ignored while rest of figures in cave painting or mobiliary art are generally dismissed
- Anthropological research shows representations of sky and celestial bodies rarely follow true arrangement (symbolic, influenced by ritual and belief systems)
- Systematic contextual studies into potential astronomical knowledge have not been carried out

**Conclusion:**
- Interest in the sky as old as humanity itself
- Caution necessary when reconstructing cognitive processes of prehistoric ancestors
- No definitive identification of astronomical knowledge in European Paleolithic cave paintings and mobiliary art to date
- Value lies in stimulating interdisciplinary approaches and new methodologies for a complex interpretative task
- Celestial phenomena may have influenced prehistoric communities, but proving this requires significant evidence beyond astronomical calculations.

### Brain Dynamics and Consciousness A Mesoscopic Perspective
**Neural Dynamics: Brain Structures and Complexity**

**Complexity in Brain Organization and Dynamics:**
- Characterized by spatial and temporal scales
- Micros, mesos, and macros levels
- High complexity due to non-linear interrelations between levels

**Neurodynamics Significance:**
- Correlates with different functional or conscious states
- Transitions between brain dynamics correspond to mental state transitions

**Mesoscopic Neurodynamics:**
- Occurs at spatial order of millimetres to centimetres, temporal order of milliseconds to seconds
- Depending on thresholds and summed activity of large number of elements (molecules and cells)
- Influenced by hormones, neuromodulators, arousal or motivation states
- Balance between opposing processes leads to oscillatory and chaotic behavior
- Interplay between microscopic and macroscopic processes

**Mesoscopic Neurodynamics Significance:**
- Relevant for mental state transitions
- Measurable with ECoG, EEG, MEG methods
- Spatio-temporal patterns of activity at collective level of neurons

**Gamma Oscillations and Attention:**
- Associated with visual attention
- Linked to perception, attention, associative memory, volition
- Interplay between sensory and motor pathways essential for environment interaction

**Consciousness Dynamics:**
- Prior to perception is attention
- Prior to action is intention
- Attention related mainly to sensory/perceptual pathways and brain areas
- Intention more related to motor areas and pathways (e.g., SMA, parietal cortex)

---

### Consciousness Evolution Across Life Forms Perception to Intentionality
**Consciousness, Attention, and Intention**

**Attention**:
- Can be extended or focused to specific parts of our internal/external world
- Often drawn to objects or events of relevance/interest
- Can also be intentionally turned to areas of interest
- Provides information about the internal/external worlds, guides actions

**Intention**:
- Precursor to volition and will, desire to act in a certain direction
- Leads to voluntary movement and behavior
- Can provide information, guide attention

**Attention and Intention in Consciousness**:
- Complementary aspects of consciousness
- Present in conscious and unconscious states (e.g., visual attention)
- Essential for exploring the external/internal world

**Consciousness and Life**:
- Attention and intention may be more universal, found even in simple organisms
- Implemented through different molecular/cellular structures than in complex nervous systems
- Perception is a basic form of consciousness, present in all life forms
- As nervous systems evolve, processes become more advanced (e.g., cognition, language)
- Human internal model includes other individuals and their minds, important for determining significance and predicting behavior

---

### Consciousness Evolution and Interaction with the Environment
**Self-Consciousness and the Sense of an I**

**Development of Self-Consciousness**:
- Developed when experienced events are given a sequential context in the internal model of the world
- Requires memories well structured in time, to be perceived
- Planning for the future, involving attention and intention, is essential in creating an \"I\"
- The subjective experience of a decision or sensory stimulation requires a time span of 3-400ms

**Importance of Models of Self**:
- Allows one to infer their own thinking, feelings, and behaviors to others, for more efficient interaction
- Understanding the world results in an experience of meaning, where relationships can be set in context (attention) and seen as purposeful (intention)

**Evolution of Consciousness and Cognition**:
- Evolution of consciousness occurs through larger evolutionary leaps when new species appear, and smaller steps within a species and organism
- The \"great leap\" of advanced consciousness is experienced by humans alone, with awareness of intentions and free will

**Views on Consciousness**:
- Consciousness can be seen as a constantly changing process, interacting with the environment
- Or, as a force field similar to an electromagnetic field, not reducible to neural or electrochemical processes
- Concepts at one level are not easily transferred to another level; new qualities emerge at each level of organizational complexity

**Relating Consciousness to Physics and Biology**:
- Consciousness transcends physics, chemistry, and biological determinism/chance
- Consciousness cannot be reduced to observable phenomena within the framework of current scientific approaches
- Instead, consciousness can be considered a \"meta-phenomenon\" or \"noumenon,\" observed indirectly through its effects on the material world

**Intentionality and Evolution**:
- Intentionality is a fundamental aspect of consciousness, related to free will
- Difficult to fit within the framework of current science, based on deterministic laws and chance
- Consciousness provides a freedom beyond indeterminism or determinism
- Exploration through attention, perception, and intention-action is fundamental at all levels of existence

## 33. The Ecological Cosmology of Consciousness
**Fundamental Mysteries of Consciousness and Its Relationship with the Physical World**

**Introduction:**
- Identification of four fundamental mysteries regarding consciousness
- Description of various classical philosophical and scientific solutions to these mysteries
- Proposal of a fifth deeper mystery: ecological reciprocalism for understanding consciousness and physical world relationship

**Mysteries of Consciousness:**
1. **What is consciousness?**: Essence of consciousness, connection with biological beings, perception of external environment
2. **Consciousness and the Physical World**: Connection between consciousness and physical reality, understanding the nature of consciousness through science
3. **Perception of an External World**: Epistemic contact between consciousness and physical world, limitations in our understanding of the physical world
4. **Cosmological Significance of Consciousness**

**Solutions:**
- General ontologies addressing the nature of reality required for answers to these mysteries

**Proposed Solution: Ecological Reciprocalism**
1. **Interdependence of Physical Universe and Consciousness**: Fundamental ontological truth and mystery of consciousness
2. **Embodied Mind**: Consciousness is always embodied, supported, and locally embedded within the physical universe
3. **Physical Universe Revealed Through Consciousness**: Existence and nature of the physical world conceptualized through consciousness
4. **Features of Ecological Reciprocalism:** Self, body and environment, technology, social networks, awareness of other conscious minds
5. **Temporal and Evolutionary Dimensions of Consciousness**
6. **Cosmological Foundations and Directionality of Future Evolution of Consciousness**

---

### Reciprocalism Interdependent Consciousness and Physical World
**Idealism vs Materialism: Two Ontological Theories**
* Idealism posits that the universe is a mental reality or manifestation of consciousness
* Physical world as experienced and understood depends on consciousness (Berkeley, 1713; Kant, 1781)
* Materialism posits that the universe is entirely physical
* Consciousness depends on active states of the physical brain (Churchland, 1986; Dennett, 1991; Ryle, 1949)

**Monistic Theories: Two Ontological Realms Derived from Each Other**
* Monism explains how consciousness is related to the physical world by deriving one ontological realm from the other (rejecting independence of either)
* Materialism argues that consciousness doesn't exist independently (Chalmers, 1996) or is a manifestation of brain states (identity theory)
* Idealism asserts that physical matter doesn't exist separately from consciousness
* Neutral monism posits mental and physical are manifestations of the same underlying reality (Spinoza, 1677; Feigl, 1967)

**Dualism: Two Distinct Realms with Interactivity**
* Dualism acknowledges two types of being: physical matter and consciousness
* No convincing explanation for interaction between realms
* Evolutionism posits that consciousness emerges from a physical substrate over time (Morrowitz, 2002; Kaufman, 2008)

**Ecological Reciprocalism: Interdependent Realities**
* Physical universe and consciousness are interdependent realities
* Neither can exist without the other for their existence (Lombardo, 1987, 2009)
* Rejecting self-sufficient substance as primary ontological realities
* Symmetry or balance between four puzzles: What is consciousness? What is the physical world? How does consciousness depend on the physical world? And how does the physical world depend on consciousness?
* Interdependency represented by Taijitu symbol (Yin and Yang)

---

### Embodied Consciousness and Reciprocal Perception
**The Reciprocity Between Consciousness and the Physical World**

**Basic Level of Perception:**
- Consciousness is always embodied, relative to a point of view
- Surrounded by and situated within the physical universe
- Meaningful manifestation of the physical world is integrated and selective relative to an embodied consciousness

**Perceptual Awareness:**
- Basic configuration: an embedded and active conscious being within an ambient environment
- Reveals physically situated perspectives of the surrounding environment
- Reciprocal awareness between body position and perceived layout of the environment

**Fundamental Loop of Interdependence:**
- Bodily behavior and proprioceptual awareness form a fundamental reciprocal loop
- Self is grounded in proprioceptual awareness and distinctive point of view

**Additional Conscious States:**
- Emotions, desires, thoughts, and imagery are localized within the embodied conscious being
- Experienced rather than in a separate ontological realm or space

**Manifestation of Consciousness:**
- When encountering another conscious being, consciousness is manifested through their body and expressions

**Physical Sciences and Understanding Reality:**
- Perceptual systems are selective, reacting to certain forms, scales, and patterns of energy
- The experienced perceptual world is highly selective
- Selective awareness attuned to meaningful environmental features

**Scientific Explorations and Realization of Consciousness:**
- Physical reality can only be consciously apprehended from within an ambient universe, through embodied consciousness, selective abstract thinking, and technologies that augment capacities.
- Structured energy patterns permeate the physical world, providing information about their existence and make-up, enabling knowledge.

---

### Evolution of Consciousness From Local to Cosmic
**Perceptual-Proprioceptual Experience**
* Fundamental experience of center-surround is grounded in stimulus information specific to physical configuration of an embodied being
* Energy conversion at multiple levels, containing rich and immense set of differences and patterned relationships
* Conscious being selectively perceives itself in relationship with a physical environment
* Process of selecting, differentiating, and integrating may be the nature of consciousness

**Embodied Consciousness**
* Embodiment reaches beyond biological limits through use of tools and technologies
* Conscious body and functionally integrated instrumentalities both realize and experience consciousness

**Temporal Dimension of Consciousness**
* Awareness of duration, stability, patterns of change, becoming, passing away, and an experiential direction to time
* Sequential flow through ongoing series of distinct apprehensions anchored in perception, memory, and anticipation
* Function of cognitive- cerebral processes may be anticipation and guidance of the future

**Evolution of Consciousness**
* Evolution toward increasing order and complexity in the physical universe
* Conscious minds create even more order and complexity within the physical universe through technological advancements and social networking
* Emergence of a global consciousness potentially leading to cosmic consciousness
* Universe evolving an embodied conscious mentality that differentiates, integrates, and brings control over its substratum.

## 34. Consciousness Dissociation and Self-Consciousness
**Dissociation, Consciousness, Self-Consciousness**

**Keywords:** Consciousness, dissociation, self-consciousness

**Introduction:**
- The conscious personality is integrated and dynamic
- However, in patients with dissociative disorders:
  - Personality is fragmented
  - Overly rigid biopsychosocial subsystems or dissociative parts exist
  - Each part believes its way of experiencing reality is objective
  - Struggles between different parts occur due to conflicting perceptions and emotions
- Dissociation can manifest in multiple distinct consciousnesses, each with unique patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving, memories

**Manifests in Dissociative Symptoms:**
- Psychoform: dissociative amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, dissociative fugue
- Somatoform: analgesia, anesthesia, loss of proprioception, dissociative seizures
- Negative symptoms: insensitivity to pain, lack of self-awareness over body parts, inability to remember recent or remote episodes
- Positive symptoms: pain, hearing voices of other dissociated parts, intruding on other dissociated parts' consciousness

**Differences Between Dissociative Parts:**
- Distinct senses of self, world, and self-in-the-world
- Belief that they are independent entities with invariant properties
- Constructive actions generate epistemic contents shaping perception of reality

**Implications:**
- Dissociative disorders challenge the notion of a single, unified consciousness
- Examining dissociative disorders can provide insights into the nature and underpinnings of self-consciousness.

---

### Embodied Mind Brain-Body-Environment Trinity in Ontological Regard
**Parts and Wholes: Studying Consciousness in Health**
* The question of studying parts of a whole is relevant to dissociative disorders and self-consciousness
* Ascribing psychological predicates to functional parts of a system confuses relationships between wholes and parts (mereological fallacy)
* **Body and Mind**: 17th century discussion on mind-body relationship, Descartes distinguished between body and mind
+ Ascribe thoughts, feelings, beliefs, fantasies, etc. to the mind rather than a living human or their personality is a mistake
+ Mind is a term for human powers, the exercise of these powers, and character traits
* **Brain/Body and Environment**: Brain/body system depends on environment; they are necessary conditions for each other
+ Interaction between brain, body, and environment determined by quantum physics theories
+ Individuals adapt to and change their environment through selected actions
+ Intrinsic relationships between brain, body, and environment (embedment)
* **Dissociative Subsystems**: Dissociative parts involve co-constitution and co-determination of a subsystem that strives to realize particular goals
+ Parts determine each other ontologically
+ Example: A part that doesn't eat exists because there are other parts that do eat.

### Dissociative Parts and Consciousness in Mental Health
**EP-Victim and EP-Controller in Dissociative Identity Disorder**

**EP-Victim**:
- Fears and avoids EP-Controller, as well as EP-Controlling
- Experiences fear proportional to EP-Controller's rejection and attacks
- Focuses primarily on surviving perceived threat

**EP-Controller**:
- Imitates perpetrators in an effort to control the uncontrollable (e.g., traumatization, attachment disruptions)
- Regards EP-Victim as weak, bad, and undeserving
- Afraid to realize that he or she was also hurt and abandoned
- Fears realizing that he or she is related to EP-Victim and ANP (Adaptive Numbing Part)
- May be mediated by the action system of social dominance

**The Illusion of the Mind**

**Consciousness**:
- Human experience is a dynamic process between brain, body, and environment
- The \"mind\" cannot be found in the brain or physical body alone
- Consciousness involves dynamic configurations of brain, body, and environment, particularly in embedded actions

**Cause and Effect**

**Aristotle's Causes**:
- Efficient cause: linear causation, such as physical action and reaction
- Final cause: goal toward which something aims (e.g., attachment)
- Formal cause: what makes a thing one sort of thing and no other (e.g., being a complex system)
- Material cause: the physical material that something is made of (e.g., cells)

**The Enactive Brain**:
- We are dynamic, self-organizing systems oriented toward observable events and goals
- Sensorimotor integration and goal-orientation cannot be explained in terms of physical causation alone
- As embodied and embedded biopsychosocial systems, we are associated with all four causes.

---

### Multiple Perspectives in Dissociative Identity Disorder First- Second- and Third-Person Views
**Dissociative Parts and Aristotelian Causes**

**Aristotelian Causes of Dissociative Parts:**
- **Final cause**: goal-oriented
- **Formal cause**: self-organizing
- **Material cause**: organic basis
- **Efficient cause**: physical and neural mechanisms involved

**Features of Dissociative Parts:**
- Synthesizes own perceptions, sensations, feelings, thoughts, memories, motor actions
- Shifts among parts lead to profound changes in consciousness
- Engage in personification but do not presentify (varying degrees)
- Constitute interrelated but insufficiently integrated subsystems of personality
- Experience a phenomenal self-model and a reflective self-model

**Epistemic Perspectives:**
- First-person perspective (FPP): subjective, private experiences
  - Generates feeling of being someone with a point of view
  - Inner perspective on self
- Second-person/quasi conditional person perspective (QSPP): intersubjective communication
  - Ability to judge different phenomenal experiences and states.

**Implications:**
- Dissociative parts constitute insufficiently integrated subsystems of personality
- They engage in their own Aristotelian causes, including the generation of a phenomenal self-model (FPP) but lack presentification ability (QSPP).
- Understanding these subsystems requires an analysis of their mutual relations and the patient's overall biopsychosocial system.

---

### Understanding Dissociative Perspectives in Self-Consciousness
**Development of Self Consciousness: Perspectives and Epistemic Abilities**
- Development of relation of mineness in QSPP (Metzinger, 1993)
  * More objective self-model than FPP
  * Includes phenomenal judgment of ownership and agency
  - Personification involves at least a judgement of ownership (e.g., My body hurts) and agency (e.g., I run)
  - Bridge between phenomenal experience and physical judgment in QSPP allows for emotional modulation
- SPP: Relationship between the \"I\" of self and others (Buber, 1983)
  * Access to another person's phenomenal experience is indirect
  * Involves empathy, joint perspective taking, and imitation
  * Mediated by mirror and canonical neurons (Pineda, 2008)
- Epistemic intermediates between FPP and TPP
- Experientially centered in body but linked with mental state
- Dissociative parts may judge themselves in terms of SPP instead of QSPP
- Confusion between QSPP and SPP is a core feature of dissociative disorders

**Understanding Consciousness and Self-Consciousness through Dissociation Research:**
- Contributes to understanding consciousness and self-consciousness by studying dynamic configurations of brain, body, and environment in dissociation
  * Comparisons between different dissociative parts and their goal orientation, epistemological features, syntheses, personification, presentification
  * Comparisons between dissociative parts and mentally healthy individuals
- Documenting differences in neural activity, brain structures, and behavioral patterns associated with experiencing, perceiving, and knowing oneself, others, objects, and events in FPP, QSPP, SPP, or TPP.

### Dissociation as a Tool to Study Consciousness in Neuroimaging Studies
**Contribution of Dissociative Research to Understanding Self and Consciousness**
- **Phenomenal sense of self, world, and self-in-the-world**: Ongoing constructions developed through interaction with material and social environment.
- **Studies on dissociative parts:**
  - Document brain structures and functions associated with normal and abnormal resting states of consciousness.
  - Compare task-related states between dissociation and normality.
  - Differences found between \"Apparently Normal Parts\" (ANP) and \"Emotional Parts\" (EP) in response to neutral and trauma memory scripts.
    * ANPs: Strong phenomenal, psychophysiological reactions, cortical activation for neutral script, but distinct patterns from EPs.
    * EPs: Weak or no reactions to neutral script, more subcortical activation, indistinguishable from ANPs in response to neutral script.
- **Potential studies:**
  - Explore neural structures and patterns involved in correct vs. incorrect discriminations of \"I-me,\" \"I-other dissociative part/friend,\" and \"I-stranger.\"

**Theoretical Considerations**
- Study focuses on understanding consciousness and self-consciousness through the dynamic configurations of brain, body, and environment relationships.
- Epistemologically, explores differences and interdependency of First Person Perspective (FPP), Second Person Perspective (QSPP/SPP), Third Person Perspective (TPP).

**Significance of Dissociative Disorders Research**
- Potential contributions to philosophy, science, and patient welfare.
- Lack of recognition in comparison with studies on other disorders like schizophrenia.

## 35. Science and the Self-Referentiality of Consciousness
**Background:**
- Scientists Michal Bitbol and Pierre Luigi discuss consciousness
- Aim: investigate harmony between their perspectives on subject
- Difficulty acknowledged due to criticism of classical reductionist science
- Common background in criticizing reductionism, autopoiesis & enaction
- Acceptance of elementary consciousness as primary
- Interest in Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology

**Challenges:**
- Scientist not ready to accept science's lack of significance on origin of consciousness
- Philosopher reluctant to engage with empirical inquiry instead of central issue

**Terminology:**
- Consciousness: actuality of lived experience, feeling, thinking, doing and being
  - Three layers: pure non-reflective experience, reflective consciousness, self-consciousness
- Not concerned with acts of volition or moral problem of good vs evil (conscience)

**Approach:**
- Study extent and limits of scientific inquiry into consciousness
- Radical self-reference: questioning consciousness is an act of consciousness
  - Consciousness existentially primary, departing from ontological primacy
- Science's basic features hinder approach to consciousness
  - Objectivity distant from subjective experience
  - Formulates truths independent of situation
  - Claims physical explanations sufficient, reducing consciousness as epiphenomenon
- Evolutionary arguments about higher order features of consciousness discussed: reflectivity or self-knowledge
  - Spandrels or adaptive features?
- Belief in supernatural powers as byproduct of higher-order features significant
- Brain as modulator versus source of consciousness.

---

### Radical Self-Referentiality of Consciousness
**The Radical Self-Reference of Consciousness**

**Pure Experience**:
- The givenness of pure experience is a universal condition for scientific inquiry
- Nonreflective and reflective consciousness are interdependent, but making the distinction is useful to understand familiar situations

**Radical Self-Referentiality**:
- Questions about consciousness are radically self-referential
- This can be recognized in advanced practices like phenomenological suspension or Zen meditation
- Ignoring this self-referentiality can lead to misguided answers, as seen in the question \"Where does consciousness come from?\"

**The True Answer**:
- Consciousness comes from now here else than here, which may not seem like a satisfactory answer at first
- But this response acknowledges that consciousness is the background condition of any act of attention

---

### The Limitations of Classical Science in Explaining Consciousness
**Indexical Term: \"I, now, this\"**
- Invites others to figure out how things appear from the standpoint of the utterer
- Expresses existential primacy of consciousness
- Plain statement of immediate experience, independent of interpretation
- Elementary features of lived experience, not derived from any argument

**Language and Science Limitations for Understanding Consciousness:**

**Meaning**:
- Displaces attention from word to meaning/signified object
- Self-referential when applied to consciousness (radical presence)

**Discrimination**:
- Difficulty distinguishing conscious experience in existential sense
- Classical science attempts to put distance between self and experience

**Classical Science:**
- Objectifies/selects invariant elements of experience for study
- Formulates universal truths through scientific laws
- Has little to say about existence or qualitative content of phenomena (appearances) experienced by someone.

---

### Evolutionary Origin of Consciousness A Connection to Biology
**Advances in Neurophysiology and Consciousness**
- Witnessed amazing advances of neurophysiology about how brain stores information, binds maps, and programs for action
- Discoveries correlated with human subjects' descriptions of conscious experience
- Scientists can speak of memory or unified consciousness instead of information binding
- Self-mapping explained instead of self-awareness
- **Limitations of Physical/Neurological Sciences**: focus on solving easy problems related to the structure and neural correlates of conscious events
- Ignoring the \"hard problem\" of the existence, origin, and feel of conscious experience

**Causal Paradox of Consciousness**
- More complete physical or neurological accounts of mental processes can push consciousness into the background as irrelevant or incidental
- Cautious remarks on the failure of a strict third-person approach to the hard problem of the physical origin of experience
- Need for introducing and taking seriously first-person reports in science

**Linking Consciousness and Evolution**
- Consciousness is connected to human biology
- Acceptance that some crucial aspects of consciousness, like reflectivity or self-awareness, are part of biological evolution and important for mankind's development and reproduction.

---

### Evolution of Consciousness as Spandrel and its Relation to Spirituality
**Evolution and Consciousness: A Debate**

**Idea of Spandrels in Evolutionary Biology:**
- Consciousness as a spandrel, not directly determined by natural selection
- Gould and Lewontin's concept of spandrels: beautiful architectural byproducts not originally planned
- Difficult to prove or argue for/against

**Consciousness as Part of Darwinian Evolution:**
- Questioning the connection between consciousness and evolution
- Love behavior as an example of a genetic determinant that aids in reproduction and survival
- Comparison with love behavior, is consciousness an animal instinct?
- Spirituality/religiosity as a possible link between consciousness and evolution
- Difficult to establish due to lack of obvious reproductive advantage

**Spirituality/Religiosity and Evolution:**
- Early humans looking at the sky and believing in superior powers
- Gods enabled internal cohesion and strength for reproduction
- Equation: consciousness = inclination for religiosity?
- Co-evolution of consciousness and spirituality/religiosity difficult to prove

**Brain Evolution and Consciousness:**
- Classical scientist's perspective: brain size increases leading to consciousness evolution
- Criticism of reductionist scientific account of radical origin of conscious experience
- Non-reductionist conception of relation between lived and living, conscious experience and biological processes (Bergerard & Oleary, 2007)

**Brain as Filter or Reducing Valve:**
- James' proposal: brain serves as permissive/transmitting/expressive function rather than productive one
- Brain limits human capacity to have spiritual experiences
- Understanding many-layered functionalities and amplifications of consciousness without weakening knowledge that raw experience is most immediate given.

---

### Quantum Physics and the Nature of Consciousness Realist vs Anti-Realist Interpretations
**Evolution of Consciousness: A Scientific Perspective**

**Potential Dangers of Hypothesis**
- Mankind may become less capable of having peak spiritual experiences
- Brain evolves to develop skills for everyday life, potentially reducing spiritual capability

**Limitations of Evolutionary Approach**
- Difficulty proving or disproving the evolution of consciousness hypothesis
- Limited knowledge on ultimate nature of consciousness

**Quantum Physics and Consciousness Connection**
- Two major ways of seeing connection: consciousness as cause, or state vector reduction as physical basis
- Measurement problem in quantum mechanics leads to potential for involving consciousness

**Realist vs. Anti-Realist Interpretations of State Vectors**
- Realist interpretation sees state vectors as intrinsic properties of physical systems
- Anti-realist interpretation views state vectors as mere bearers of experimental information, used for predicting outcomes

**Implications for the Philosophy of Mind and Consciousness**
- Quantum mechanics provides important clarifications for the philosophy of mind and consciousness
- Contextuality of quantum phenomena: they cannot be said to reveal an intrinsic property, but still hold independently of particular experimental situations.

---

### Sciences Limits in Understanding Consciousness
**Relation Between Consciousness and Quantum Physics**
- Itersituational consent cannot be obtained without detachment of an object in both consciousness and quantum physics
- Epistemological status of a science of mind and consciousness is similar to that of quantum physics (Bitbol, 2000, 2002)
  - No true properties but only observables in quantum physics
  - Similar strategy for obtaining intersubjective consensus about livables in consciousness
- Conception of matter in quantum physics challenges materialist view
  * Matter is a phenomenon shaped by sense organs or experimental apparatuses
  * Abstract pattern of field-like dispositions, not fundamental stuff
- Evolutionary approach to consciousness: no origin elucidation but brings out scientific method shortcomings and advantages
  * Reasoning about consciousness included in what's reasoned about, creating a fake sense of objectivity
- Phenomenology as a promising approach for fundamental questions about consciousness
  * Doesn't rely on reasoning but pure description (Bracketing of reasoning might be its major quality)
- Traditional science cannot shed light on the ultimate nature of consciousness
- Scientific inquiry can enrich us with complementary notions about conscious life
- Bold hypothesis: Development of the brain in two opposite directions (improvement of technical and logical abilities vs loss of contemplative/spiritual potential) is a challenging intellectual enterprise.

---

## 36. Cosmological Implications of Near-Death Experiences
**Near-Death Experiences and Materialism**

**Background:**
- Some neuroscientists, physicists, and psychologists believe consciousness is produced by or a subjective component of brain states (Crick, 1994; Damasio & Meyer, 2009; Searle, 2000)
- Brain changes correlate with mental changes, but correlation does not imply causation
- Production model: Mind is produced by the brain
- Filter or transmission model: Brain may permit or mediate the mind

**Near-Death Experiences:**
- Retained consciousness during clinical death challenges materialist theories
  - Terminal lucidity: Enhanced mental clarity in patients with chronic conditions before death (Brierre de Boismont, 1862; Burdach, 1826; Marshall, 1815; Nahm & Greyson, 2009; Turetskaia & Romanenko, 1975)
- Near-Death Experiences (NDEs): Reported by 12% to 18% of cardiac arrest survivors (Parnia et al., 2001; Greyson, 2003; van Lommel et al., 2001)
- NDEs challenge materialist mind-brain production model

**NDE Components:**
- Heightened or mystical consciousness on the threshold of death
- Described since the 19th century, studied systematically for past 30 years (Holden et al., 2009)
- Experiences include: feeling of peace and joy; out-of-body perspective; sense of pain; bright light or Being of Light; encountering other beings, often deceased persons; memory revival or full life review; sensation of a barrier or border.

---

### General Anesthesia and Cardiac Arrest Challenging Mind-Brain Production Theory of NDEs
**Hypotheses Proposed to Explain NDEs**
- Attributed to psychopathology (Noyes & Klett, 1976; Pfister, 1930)
- Unique personality traits (Gow et al., 2003; Lynn & Rhue, 1988)
- Altered blood gases (Whinnery, 1997)
- Neurotoxic metabolic reactions (Carr, 1982; Jansen, 1997)
- Alterations in brain activity (Morse et al., 1989; Saavedra-Aguilar & Gmez-Jeria, 1989)

**Evidence Supporting Reductionistic Hypotheses**:
- Intriguing but only address selected aspects of NDE phenomena
- Mental clarity, vivid sensory imagery, clear memory, and conviction are norm for NDEs
- Occur even in conditions of drastically altered cerebral physiology

**NDEs Triggered by Physical Conditions**:
- Typically triggered during clinical near death situations: catastrophic physical traumas or loss of vital functions
- 10 times more common among patients who had survived definite cardiac arrest than other serious cardiac incidents (Greyson, 2003)

**NDEs and General Anesthesia**:
- Same features as other NDEs: out-of-body experiences, bright light, deceased acquaintances
- Brain activity drastically reduced under anesthesia according to EEG studies (John et al., 2001; Alkire, 1998; Shulman et al., 2003)
- Evidence against the possibility of producing clear thinking or memory

**NDEs and Cardiac Arrest**:
- Same features as other NDEs: enhanced sensation and mentation, out-of-body experiences, visions of deceased acquaintances
- Cerebral functioning shuts down within seconds due to lack of blood flow and oxygen uptake (DeVries et al., 1998; Vriens et al., 1996)
- Absence of cardiac output, respiration, and brainstem reflexes, indicating full arrest (Parnia & Fenwick, 2002; van Lommel et al., 2001)
- Neuronal action-potentials rapidly abolished (Kelly et al., 2007)

**Conclusion**:
- Mind-brain production theory unable to explain NDEs due to lack of detectable brain activity under general anesthesia or cardiac arrest conditions.

---

### Near-Death Experiences Challenging Materialist Explanations
**Theories and Defenses for NDEs:**
- The production theory, which suggests the brain produces consciousness, cannot fully explain NDEs due to:
  - Evidence of anoxia's effect on hippocampus cells, making complex memory formation unlikely during these conditions
  - Unconsciousness from cardiac arrest leaves patients amnesic and confused for preceding/following episodes
  - Reports of accurate descriptions of events during periods of brain insult (e.g., cardiac arrest victims describing resuscitation procedures)
- Second defense: NDEs occur before or after the insult, not during it
  - Unconsciousness produced by cardiac arrest typically results in amnesia and confusion for preceding/following events
  - Substantial number of NDEs contain verifiable reports of events occurring during the period of insult itself
- Third defense: Near-death experiences challenge materialist reductionism
  - Early 20th century, materialist cosmology assumed complex phenomena could be explained by reducing them to components and eventually elementary particles
  - This worldview ignored consciousness as scientific until quantum physics required reference to consciousness for explanation
  - NDEs reveal limitations of the production theory and demand a more comprehensive theory of mind-brain interaction
- Fourth defense: Enhanced mental processes during NDEs cannot be explained by the production theory
  - Many NDEs describe clearer, lucid thinking and unusually vivid sensory experiences
  - Analysis showed enhanced mental functioning was more common when people were physiologically close to death than not (Owens et al., 1990)
  - Examples: rapid revival of memories, almost instantaneous panoramic review of entire life, seeing one's body from a different perspective, witnessing events around the body.

---

### Perception of Events Beyond Sensory Reach in Near-Death Experiences
**Mind-Brain Production Theory**

**Limitations of the Mind-Brain Production Theory**:
- Belief that one has witnessed events around one's body can be attributed to:
  - Retrospective imaginative reconstruction based on ability to hear or memory of objects/events near loss of consciousness
  - Memory of events just before or after loss of consciousness
  - Expectations about what likely occurred
- Explanations are inadequate due to:
  - Absence of clear and accurate memories of events surrounding loss of consciousness
  - Lack of substantiation by controlled studies on anesthetized patients' abilities to be aware of their environment
  - Differences between phenomena observed during Near Death Experiences (NDEs) and experiences under anesthesia, including:
    - Duration and intensity
    - Specific sensory channels involved
    - Level of consciousness/awareness
  - Inability to explain cases where vision is reported despite being blocked by surgical procedure

**Studies Challenging the Mind-Brain Production Theory**:
- Sabom's study: found that NDE patients accurately described resuscitation procedures, while comparison patients made errors
- Sartori's five-year study: found that NDE patients accurately described their resuscitation, while non-NDE patients made errors
- Cases of perception beyond reach of senses during NDEs:
  - Corroborated by independent witnesses in some cases
  - Includes accurate perceptions of unexpected or unlikely details
- Experiences of deceased persons during NDEs:
  - More common among people close to death than hallucinations reported by others
  - Differs from hallucinations reported by non-NDE patients, who are more likely to see living persons

---

### Neurodissociative Experiences Under Extreme Conditions Challenging the Mind-Brain Production Theory
**Whinnery (1997) Study Findings:**
- Healthy fighter pilots reporting hallucinations during G-LOC experiences: seeing deceased friends and family members
  - Example: 20-year-old pilot saw his mother and brother
  - Pilots may perceive deceased individuals with whom they had emotional connections, but one-third had no prior relationship or had never met the person

**Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) and Deceased Persons:**
- NDE experiencers who were close to death more likely to perceive deceased persons than those who were ill but not near death
  - Even if emotionally distant or had never met, the vision cannot be attributed to expectations as they had no knowledge of recent deaths

**Vision of Living Persons in NDEs:**
- Reports date back to the 19th century (Cobbe, 1882; Gurney & Myers, 1889; Johnson, 1899; Sidgwick, 1885) and continue to be reported in recent years
- In some cases, the dying person sees a living person they thought was alive, who had recently died

**Challenge of NDEs:**
- Asking how complex consciousness can occur under conditions where current neurophysiological models deem it impossible
- Materialist model of brain producing mind vs. occurrence of NDEs during general anesthesia and cardiac arrest

**Conclusion:**
- Progress in understanding consciousness requires accommodating extraordinary experiences such as NDEs within our models of consciousness
- Contemporary consciousness models based on classical physics are incomplete; post-classical physics offers empirical support for a new conceptualization of mind-brain interface.

---

## 37. Near Death Experiences and the 5th Dimensional Spatio-Temporal Perspective
**Near Death Experiences (NDEs)**

**Characteristics and Perception during NDEs:**
- Detailed analysis of unusual spatial and temporal perception in 70 cases of NDEs
- Reveals hidden logic, suggesting a model with an extra dimension for the point of perception
- Model proposed is consistent with NDE accounts, unlike purely hallucinatory interpretations

**NDE Perceptions:**
- Patients report clear memories and accurate descriptions of surroundings during unconscious state
  - Out of Body Experience (OBE) in 70% of cases
    - Precise perceptions in 48% of OBEs, including verified details and scenes

**Distinguishing NDE Perceptions:**
- Different from well-known phenomena like sleep paralysis or lucid dreams
- Classical NDE consists of several stages: OBE, tunnel, brilliant light, life review, encountering being of light/deceased relatives, feeling of a limit not to be crossed.
  - Objective elements only found in the OBE stage, making it suitable for scientific investigation.

**Strange Account from a Patient:**
- Reported seeing surroundings from all directions simultaneously
  - Saw body through sofa, top of head and left/right sides
  - Perceived everything in room as if looking at a three-dimensional universe from fourth dimension

**Implications and Findings:**
- Interpreting NDEs as perceptions from an external point to our universe is speculative but compatible with some old accounts.
- Patients described clear memories and accurate descriptions, not just vague or distorted.
- Further investigation required into the modalities of these paradoxical perceptions without making assumptions about their reality.

---

### Multidimensional Consciousness in Near-Death Experiences
**Perception During Near-Death Experiences (NDEs)**
* Individuals describe strange yet consistent perceptual features during NDEs
* Ability to see in multiple dimensions simultaneously from an external perspective
* Seeing objects in their entirety without moving or looking through walls
* Description of a model explaining the irrational perception during an NDE

**Model Proposal for Understanding NDE Perception**
* Overview: Vantage point theory
  * Observation of normal vs. other dimensional perspective
  * Comparison of perceptions allows understanding
* Example of Teedee's house
  * Two-dimensional being (Teedee) cannot see entire scene from his perspective
  * Human perception sees everything at a glance
* Applicability to NDE experiences and their descriptions.

---

### Perception of Omnipresence and Passing Through Solid Objects in Near-Death Experiences
**Perception and Vision in Near Death Experiences (NDEs)**

**Total, Instantaneous Vision:**
- Patient describes having a larger angle of vision, seeing multiple locations simultaneously
- Orientation but not physical location
- Total, instantaneous perception

**Instantsane Moving and Zooming:**
- Displacement and zooming sensation combined
- Difficult to separate time and space
- No compartmentalization or delineated directions
- Feeling of being able to move instantly or zoom on details

**Passing Through Walls:**
- NDErs report passing through walls or ceilings
- Same appearance as reality, but can see elements of matter
- T weedee's interpretation: 2D walls are black lines for him
- Easy passage through walls without difficulty.

---

### Multisensory Perception in Near-Death Experiences
**360 Degree Vision during NDEs**

**Characteristics of 360 Degree Vision:**
- Expanded field of vision beyond physical limitations (360 degrees)
- Simultaneous viewing of surroundings without movement
- Panoramic perspective with complete visual understanding
- Ability to see details and identify objects from various angles
- Holographic impression, rich experience
- Centripetal perception focused on one's own body or point of projection

**NDE Experiences:**
1. J.M: Surprised by extensive angle of vision (front, behind, underneath)
2. X.S and N.D: 360 spherical vision with a global perspective
3. F.E: Panoramic view with changing perspective based on movements
4. A.S: Quasi holographic vision, seeing in front, behind, all details simultaneously
5. K.E: Observing self from multiple perspectives and being everywhere at once
6. J-M.W.: Enlarged vision allowing observation of different places at the same time
7. A.L: Ability to be in various places all at once with a greatly enlarged vision.
8. Unusual experiences of NDEs include: seeing things from above, sideways, from profile, facing forwards, and under the bed or room.

**Implications:**
- Expansion of visual perception beyond physical limitations during NDEs
- Ability to observe surroundings without limitation or movement
- Simultaneous viewing of details from various angles
- Enhanced understanding through a panoramic perspective
- Possible connection with the concept of seeing everything at once.

---

### Dynamic Perspective Effects in NDE Perceptions
**Perception by Transparency in Near Death Experiences (NDEs)**

**Observations:**
- Some NDE survivors report seeing through objects and having a clear, detailed vision of their surroundings
- This is often described as a \"global\" or \"holographic\" view, with the ability to see both the front and back of things at once
- This phenomenon can be explained by an altered state of consciousness that allows for perception beyond physical limitations

**Examples:**
1. M.L.: \"I could see everything at once and if I focused on one thing, I could see this thing through any obstacle and in every detail\"
2. A.R.: \"I could see in front and behind myself simultaneously, a holographic view\"
3. P.F.: \"I left the car and could see myself from above, thus the car's roof was transparent\"
4. C.C.: \"A very wide vision, through the walls if I wanted to\"
5. J-M.M.: \"I saw myself exit, since I saw my body on the operating table...I was above and could see everything, everywhere\"
6. H.C.: \"Through objects\"
7. F.E.: \"I felt like a soap bubble with eyes strolling about above at ceiling level...Behind a wall was a woman dying in the resuscitation room\"
8. J.M.: \"I could see up close and also transparently...I remember seeing a stick of lipstick in one of the nurses' pockets\"
9. Be.N.: \"When I was at ceiling level, I could see through myself\"
10. F.U.: \"I floated on the left of the ceiling and looked down on the people operating...I had a very sharp vision and saw through a section of the table\"

**Dynamic Perspective Effects:**
- In some cases, the point of perception may move dynamically, allowing for new perspectives
- T. weedee's experience illustrates this when he moves perpendicularly away from his body while remaining above it, seeing everything in its vicinity from a new vantage point.

---

### Perceptions of Non-Linear Time and Space During NDEs
**Understanding NDE Perceptions of Space and Time**
* **Feeling of moving away from body:** M.M uses the term \"geographically total\" to describe feeling of moving away from her body, perpendicular to our universe (M.M). K.E describes it as going away while staying at the same place, with a widened sight (K.E).
* **Perceptual conflict:** Twee dee can be everywhere and nowhere at once but also sees his body getting smaller in another dimension (M.Q). C.F feels he's moving diagonally upwards towards the ceiling but the ceiling seems to move back with him (C.F).
* **Fourth dimension:** Notion of a fourth dimension has been discussed since 19th century as mathematical and geometric speculations, within metaphysics, philosophy, fine arts, etc. For rigor, we should consider at least a five-dimensional world with space and time closely linked (Brumblay 2003).
* **Perception during NDE:** Notions of time or duration may disappear, leading to an eternal present or omnitime experience for some individuals (S.D, K.E, M.M, M-P .S, M.N). In other cases, time seems to flow differently and everything happens at once (A.L).

---

### Perception of Time During Near-Death Experiences
**The Experience of Time During Near Death Experiences (NDEs)**

**Past, Present, Future: A New Perspective on Time**
- NDEs lead to unique experiences of time
- No sense of past or future; eternal present
- Einstein studied the concept due to personal experience (C.N.)

**Experience vs. Chronological Time**
- Contradiction between experiencing something and the need to last (apparent contradiction)
- NDErs observe a time that is not their own

**Two Forms of Time?**
- Some argue for psychological explanation: brain reconstruction
- But NDErs insist on experienced second time

**The Spatialization of Time in NDEs**
- Perspective from above eliminates notions of behind and ahead
- Past, present, future merge or disappear (X.S., M.O.)

**Reviewing Life: Past, Present, Future**
- Some report chronological review of their life during NDEs
- Anomalies and perspective effects strengthen hypothesis

**The Four Dimensional Universe Perceived Whole**
- Hypothesis: extra-dimensional vantage point
- Supported by accounts of various temporal perspectives.

---

### Perception Beyond Time NDE Accounts
**Non-locality and Time Perspective in NDEs**

**Observing Time from Outside Space-Time:**
- NDErs report feeling outside space-time, similar to seeing everything at once (M.Z., P.B., J-M.M.)
- Experiences include access to past, present, and future
- Ability to move around in time (D.S., A.T.)
- Perception of time as a continuum or single moment (F.N., Be.N.)

**Consequences of Timeless Perspective:**
- Seeing entire life from different angles (J-Y .C., Jourdan)
- Understanding all aspects of self and others in great detail (J-Y .C.)
- Difficulty explaining or sharing the experience using common words.

**Experiences of Flying Over Time:**
- Past, present, and future seen simultaneously as a whole (M.Z., P.B., J-M.M., D.S., A.T)
- Time does not unfold linearly but is integrated into life (J-Y .C.)
- Ability to move through time freely and change angles of view (J-Y .C.)

**Perspective on Space-Time Relativity:**
- J-Y .C.'s summary of relativity aligns with Einstein's ideas
- Seeing one's own life as a 3D object with integrated time (J-Y .C.)

**Difficulty Explaining the Experience:**
- NDErs find it difficult to share or explain their experience using common words.

### Five-Dimensional Consciousness Exploring Extra Dimensions in Near-Death Experiences and Brane Cosmology
**Near Death Experiences (NDEs)**

**Description of NDEs:**
- Some people report feeling their entire life unfold before them, undifferentiated in time
- No irrefutable proof for afterlife experiences (AVPs) yet

**Hypotheses:**
1. Inner hypothesis: NDEs are purely subjective experiences, result of brain activity
   - Hippocampus responsible for hallucinations
     * Creates cognitive map of environment and movements
     * Under certain conditions, can create visual hallucination of being outside body
2. Outer hypothesis: NDEs could be evidence of additional dimensions
   * Consciousness is part of our world and follows natural laws
   - Unusual circumstances may reveal new information about consciousness or brain functioning

**Four or Five Dimensions:**
- First proposals date back centuries, within Euclidean space (3 spatial dimensions)
- Modern mathematical setting: Minkowski space (4D space-time continuum)
- For accurate background to model, fifth dimension would be required for perspective effects

**Recent Extra Dimension Theories:**
- First proposal from German mathematician Theodor Kaluza and Swedish physicist Oskar Klein in 1921-1926
- Abandoned but resurfaced with string theories in the late 20th century
  * String theory: particles as one-dimensional objects
  * Brane cosmology: four-dimensional universe confined within a five-dimensional space
    **Models of brane cosmology:**
      - Finite size, not sufficient for perspective effects (1mm)
      - Infinite size, suitable for extradimensional modeling proposed by Randall and Sundrum in 1999.

### Space-Time Perception in Near-Death Experiences A Multidimensional Approach
**Model: Scalar Relativity**
- Elaborated by Laurent Nottale (1993, 2010, Tamar 2008)
- Two interesting characteristics: a fifth topological dimension and spatialization of time

**Characteristics of the Model:**
* Universe perceived as space-time during Near Death Experiences (NDEs)
* Possible addition of a spacelike dimension (4D universe), status of time unclear
* Observer's perspective: massless perception in NDEs
* Simple test proposed: hidden target near places where NDEs occur

**Implications and Predictions:**
- Could consciousness be result of interactions between 4D and 5D phenomena/universes?
- Global perception/acquiring of information allows instantaneous global information
- Scientific research on NDEs justifies a multidisciplinary approach

**Conclusion:**
- Hyper dimensional interpretation of perceptual particularities in NDEs intriguing
- Analysis focuses on global perception and acquiring of information, free from metaphysical a priori.

## 38. In the Borderlands of Consciousness and Dreams Spirituality Rising from Consciousness in Crisis
**The Borderlands of Consciousness in Crisis: Spirituality Rising from Crisis**

**Introduction:**
- The brain is a marvel that has produced great human achievements
- Shakespeare, Kandel highlight the brain's grandeur and power
- The primal role of the brain is to keep us alive through regulating blood flow

**Consciousness in Crisis: Near-Death Experiences**
- Crisis can include transient cardiac dysrhythmia
- Popular conceptions of near-death experiences (tunnel, light, out-of-body) are colored by personal life experiences and psychology
- Philosopher Sir Alfred Ayre's near-death experience: crossing River Styx, saw classical education behind him
- Carl Jung's near-death experience: saw burning lamps surrounding a door leading to a stone temple
- Near-death experiences not limited to specific cultural figures or beliefs (Elvis)
- William James' conception of spiritual experience touches on the divine

**Overlooking Crisis: The Importance of Consciousness in Crisis**
- Discussion on near-death experiences has overshadowed the fact that first and foremost, near-death experience is a form of consciousness in crisis.

---

### Locus Coeruleus and Consciousness Regulation
**The Brain's Three Conscious States**
- The brain has three mental states: waking, REM sleep, and non-REM sleep
- Waking consciousness is intuitively assumed to be available during crisis, but this may not always be the case
- Consciousness must be in lockstep with the fight-or-flight response, which is orchestrated by the limbic system

**The First Border of Consciousness**
- The border between consciousness and unconsciousness is not always abrupt and absolute
- When blood flow drops below 23cc/100 grams of brain per minute, the cerebral cortex fails, leading to consciousness loss within ten seconds
- Consciousness can come and go if cerebral blood flow waxes and wanes across this threshold
- Neuronal death begins after minutes without sustained blood flow
- The second threshold increases over hours, reaching 17-18 mL/100 grams of brain per minute

**The Metronome of Waking Consciousness**
- Epinephrine (adrenaline) and nor-epinephrine (nor-adrenaline) serve vital functions during crisis
- The locus coeruleus (LC), a cluster of 16,000 neurons in the pons, is the nearly exclusive source of nor-epinephrine in the brain
- LC discharge rates correspond to primate behaviors: low rates = low arousal, moderate rates = focused attention, high rates = visual scanning and shifting attentiveness
- During waking consciousness, the LC activity is important for maintaining vigilance under stress
- LC activation increases during conditions that promote hypoxia, hypotension, hypercarbia, and fear, often present in near-death experiences

**LC Activity and REM Consciousness**
- The cholinergic pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) nuclei counterbalance the waking actions of the serotonergic dorsal raphe and noradrenergic LC
- Factors promoting REM consciousness can inhibit the LC, which is relatively silent during REM sleep
- Counterbalances like the cholinergic REM system could potentially act on the adrenergic LC if scanning attention becomes maladaptive or focused attention is necessary in crisis.

---

### REM Consciousness Transitions and Crisis Response
**The Functioning of the LC: REM Consciousness**

**The Role of LC in Shifting Consciousness:**
- Provides a clue to how the brain might shift from waking to REM consciousness at an inopportune moment for survival
- Requires understanding REM consciousness and its impact on the brainstem

**REM Consciousness**:
- Characterized by visual system activation and cerebral cortical activation
- Accompanied by rapid eye movements (REM) and PGO waves traveling from the pons to the thalamus and visual cortex
- Triggers powerful visual sensations when dreaming
- Occurs in all mammals, suggesting its importance

**The Purpose of Dreams**:
- Contributes emotions, often fear, from the limbic system
- Simulates and rehearses solutions to threats
- Evolutionarily important for instinctual behavior

**REM Switch**:
- Located near the LC and composed of several components
- Shifts consciousness between REM and waking states
- Operates in an all or none flip-flop fashion

**The Role of VLPAG in Suppressing REM Consciousness:**
- Activates during pain, hypoxia, or moderate blood loss
- Retracts the adrenergic nervous system and brings the cholinergic system to dominance
- May be related to the neurons within the REM consciousness switch

**Blending of REM and Waking Consciousness**:
- Occurs frequently but often goes unrecognized
- Manifested in sleep paralysis and visual or auditory hallucinations

---

### Vagus Nerve and Near-Death Experiences Bridging the Boundaries of Consciousness
**Near-Death Experiences and REM Consciousness**

**Prevalence of Near-Death Experiences**:
- Occurs in 6.3% to 12% of people
- Up to 40% of those who survive cardiac dysrhythmia experience a near-death experience
- Greater incidence of REM blending into waking consciousness compared to controls

**Characteristics of Near-Death Experiences**:
- Psychological reaction to danger, including detachment and dissociation
- Heightened arousal and sense of greater control
- Visual phenomena, such as tunnel or light at the end

**Relationship Between Vagus Nerve Stimulation and REM Consciousness**:
- Vagus nerve stimulation triggers visual, cortical, and atonic physiological facets of REM consciousness in animals
- Electrical vagal stimulation in humans leads to REM intruding into non-REM consciousness
- Cardio-respiratory instability in Guillain-Barr syndrome leads to florid intrusion of REM consciousness

**Mechanisms Behind Vagus Nerve Influence on Consciousness**:
- Vagal afferents project upwards to synapse within the medullary nucleus tractus solitarius
- Neural fibers rise from the nucleus tractus solitarius to the pontine parabrachial nuclear complex (PBN)
- The PBN is a principal relay for ascending cardio-respiratory afferents to the forebrain
- Reciprocal connections between the nucleus tractus solitarius, PBN, and cholinergic REM structures
- Vagal afferents can shift consciousness towards REM states, leading to unexpected transport of consciousness.

---

### REM Consciousness and Near-Death Experiences A Neurological Perspective
**Out-of-Body Experience (Autoscopy)**
- Common and normal experience reported by 5.8% of over 13,000 people surveyed
- Occurs during near-death experiences, danger, and syncope
- Linked to REM consciousness
- Frequency decreases with narcolepsy treatment
- Produced by stimulating temporoparietal region
- Selected inactivity of dorsolateral prefrontal and temporoparietal regions during REM consciousness suggests relationship

**Reward System and Near-Death Feelings**
- Brain's reward system may underlie feelings of rapture, peace, or euphoria in near-death experiences
- PPT and LDT nuclei promote both REM consciousness and reward behavior
- Pathways from these REM structures project to ventral tegmental region
- Vental tegmental neurons vigorously discharge during REM consciousness
- In animals, PPT injury reduces reward seeking behavior for strong stimuli like food or heroin
- Human limbic and paralimbic regions active in REM sleep are important in the reward system
- Pleasant feelings common during syncope suggest activation of reward pathways

**Dreams and Near-Death Experiences**
- REM consciousness may underlie narrative, ineffable, transcendental, or paranormal qualities of near-death
- Amygdala and anterior cingulate gyrus activity detected during PET scans in REM sleep
- Propagation of PGO waves to basolateral amygdala, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus
- Dreams and near-death experiences share similarities like sensing someone's presence
- Senses realness during near-death contrasts with bizarreness of dreams
- Dorso-lateral prefrontal region may remain active during REM consciousness in some cases, contributing to a blurred border between reality and dream

**Conclusion**
- Proposed relationship between REM consciousness and near-death experience is reasonable from neurological perspective
- Mystery of why experiences occur remains even if brain function is understood.

- Role of neurotransmitters (serotonin) in suppressing these abilities
- Evolutionary purpose for mental capabilities

**Dreams and Past Lives:**
- Childhood dream of previous life by the sea shore
- Mass retreat from incoming ocean wave
- Destruction and revelation
- Screams and panic among people

- Ancestral memories and archetypes
- Residual impressions from ancient civilizations
- Recalled even thousands of years later.

---

### Dreams Predicting Death Lincolns Foreshadowed Assassination
**Reincarnation and Dreams**

**Evidence for Past Lives and Dreams**
- Some children dream of previous lives and deaths (Dossey et al., 2011)
- Not just dreams, but personal memories
- Genetic memories may be passed horizontally between species

**Genetics and Memories**
- Genetic ancestry stretches backward in time
- Memories potentially stored in DNA
- Information can be analyzed during sleep

**Dreams as Predictors of Future**
- Dreams serve multiple purposes, including reflecting mental/emotional activity and predicting future intentions
- Dreams may instruct dreamer much like thinking serves conscious mind

**Biblical Example: Abraham Lincoln's Dream**
- April 1865: Abraham Lincoln dreamed of his own death by assassination
- Deeply troubled and shared with a few friends (Lamon, 1865/1994)
- Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865

**Ancient Beliefs in Dreams as Predictors of Future**
- Ancient societies saw dreams as important sources of future information
- Carefully observed and interpreted.

---

### Predicting the Future through Dreams and Genetics Quantum Connections
**Ancient Beliefs about Dreams:**
* Ancient civilizations believed dreams contained important information for individuals and their communities (Greece, Rome, Egypt, Babylon)
* Dreams taken seriously by highly sophisticated societies, even announced in Roman Senate
* Predictions of dreams came true: Pharaoh's dream of seven years of plenty followed by famine

**Joseph's Dream:**
* Biblical story of Joseph's dreams
* Sheaves stood upright, symbolizing future power over brothers
* Ancient Egyptians believed dreams foretold future

**Quantum Future:**
* Past, present, and future may be connected in 4th dimension (space-time)
* Mind can journey through space-time, encountering different \"nows\"
* Quantum states of the future might affect present experiences

**Genetic Destiny:**
* Future influenced by past: inherited genes determine who we become
* Hardwired aspects in our genome shape lives and destiny
* Genetic ancestry older than Earth, possibly influencing life on other planets or dimensions.

### The Neuroanatomy of Dreams Right Hemisphere Dominance in REM Sleep
**Neurobiology of Dreams: Overview**

**Sleep Stages:**
- REM (rapid eye movement) sleep consists of five distinct stages, closely associated with dream appearance
  - Occurs during paradoxical or active sleep
  - Brain is aroused and active, body musculature paralyzed except for respiration and eye movements
  - Normal sensory reception attenuated
  - Temperature control lost, pain sensation rare, males tend to have an erection
  - REM cycles occur every 90-100 minutes
- NREM (non-REM) sleep consists of slow-wave or synchronized sleep
  - Brain in a state of heightened activity and arousal during REM dreaming
  - Normal routes of sensory reception restricted, but brain still processes information
  - Dreams reported 80% of the time during REM and 20% during NREM
  - Distinct differences in content between REM and NREM dreams (visual imagery vs. thought-like)

**Right Hemisphere Activity:**
- High levels of activity within pons, lateral geniculate nucleus, and occipital lobes during REM sleep (PGO waves)
- Electrophysiologically, right hemisphere becomes highly active during REM while left hemisphere is more active during NREM
- Increased cerebral blood flow in right temporal and parietal regions during REM and in subjects reporting visual, hypnagogic, hallucinatory dreams (Meyer et al., 1987)
- Enhanced activity in right temporal-occipital area increases dreaming and REM sleep duration (Hodoba, 1986)

**Left Hemisphere Deficits:**
- Defective dreaming, visual imagery deficits, loss of hypnagogic imagery found in patients with focal lesions or hypoplasia of the posterior right hemisphere and abnormalities in corpus callosum (Botez et al., 1985; Kerr & Foulkes, 1981; Murri et al., 1984)
- Paucity of REM episodes reported after split-brain surgery, with some dream activity still present (Greenwood et al., 1977)

---

### REM Sleep and Serotonin A Look at Dreaming Mechanisms
**Effects of Hemisphere Damage on Dream Reporting**
- Ability to report and recall dreams significantly reduced in individuals with left hemisphere damage, particularly posterior portions (aphasic patients)
- Difficulty describing things during waking hours adds to the challenge of reporting dreams
- Differential activation of right vs. left hemispheres during REM vs. N-REM sleep contributes to hallucinatory-mosaic experienced during dreaming

**Role of Right Hemisphere in Dreaming**
- Dominant for most non-verbal and visual-spatial perceptual activity as well as social-emotional nuances
- Able to draw conclusions, make predictions, selectively store information, and act on that information willfully
- Perceives stimuli during dreams which may not be perceived during waking hours
- Assimilates and draws conclusions about non-social environmental variables, making predictions

**Visual-Emotional Hallucination Aspects of Dreaming**
- Occur during REM sleep
- Involve amygdala, hippocampus, right temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and brainstem nuclei in lateral and medial pons
- Mediated by cyclic fluctuations in neurotransmitter levels, especially serotonin (SE), which suppresses REM sleep and dreaming activity

**Role of Neurotransmitters in Dreaming**
- Cholinergic neurons located in the lateral pons initiate and/or maintain production of REM sleep and muscle atonia during dreams
- REM-on neurons (predominantly cholinergic) become highly active, decreasing with time until REM-of f neurons take over, inducing a 90-minute cycle between REM and N-REM sleep
- REM-of f neurons suppress REM activity and interfere with dreaming by decreasing their activity during the initiation of REM episodes

**Serotonin (5HT) in Dreaming**
- Low levels associated with REM sleep and dreaming
- Exerts inhibitory influences on various brain structures, suppressing incoming sensory input and processing information from multiple modalities simultaneously
- Focuses attention by filtering out irrelevant signals
- Suppresses activity in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and synaptic functioning in the visual cortex, as well as the amygdala

---

### The Amygdala Gateway to Multiple Perceptual Realities
**The Amygdala: Gateway to Multiple Perceptual Processing**
* The amygdala is highly responsive to social and emotional stimuli conveyed vocally, visually, through touch, or body language
* Contains neurons that respond selectively to smiles and the eyes, and can differentiate between male and female faces and emotions
* Single neurons in the amygdala can respond to multiple sensory modalities simultaneously
* Overall, the amygdala is involved in attention, learning, and memory due to its role in emotional, motivational, and multi-modal assimilation of sensory impressions
* The right amygdala (and right hippocampus) is involved in the production of dream imagery and REM sleep

**Dreaming Backwards: Dreams Triggered by External Stimuli**
* During dreaming, dominant sensory streams are suppressed, but subcortical and limbic structures continue to process sensory information
* Sensations experienced during sleep can be incorporated into the dream and trigger it
* The dream may lead up to the external stimulus, giving it meaning in the context of the dream

**Damon Wells: Son of the Devil**
* The witness joined the US Army in 1980 and was stationed in Germany in 1981
* He met Damon Wells, who introduced himself as \"Son of the Devil\"
* The witness became friends with Damon due to their isolated military duty
* The witness was a satellite technician

---

### Damon Wells Sacrificing Victims to the Devil
**Damon Well's Background:**
- Damon Wells was a skilled mechanic and electric generator repairman at a remote site without electricity
- Exhibited odd behavior, including hearing voices and claiming to communicate with the devil
- Spent hours in meditation or trance-like states on a mountain, sometimes for hours in harsh weather conditions
- Found a cave deep in the woods where he believed he could speak to the devil
- Performed rituals and had objects associated with black magic in the cave

**Damon's Beliefs:**
- Damon claimed to be able to communicate with the devil through meditation
- Believed that the devil required sacrifices, including animals and humans
- Claimed he had committed a murder for the devil's pleasure
- Thought he was possessed by demons and couldn't be helped by priests or psychiatists

**Incident on 8/27/1984:**
- Damon took LSD and was given a mission by the devil to sacrifice a woman named Tanya Z.
- Tanya's car stalled on Highway 17, and Damon offered her a ride when she was stranded
- Instead of helping, he took her deep into the woods, assaulted her, killed her, and left her body on a rock
- Tanya's friends and family reported her missing, but no evidence was found at the scene.

---

### Dreams and LSD-Induced Hallucinations
**No signs of a struggle. Just an abandoned car.**
- Damon experienced after-effects of LSD, visualizing the murder
- Victim, Tanya, appeared in his dreams as an avenging spirit
- Woman named Sunshine had a nightmare about the murder
- Sunshine's dream revealed the location of Tanya's body

**Souls and Wandering Spirits**
- Ancient humans believed souls and spirits wandered during sleep and dreams (Brandon 1967; Frazier 1950; Harris 1993; Jung 1945, 1964; Malinowski 1990)
- Believed the soul could escape body via mouth or nostrils during dreams
- Spirits of the dead could visit dreams to convey knowledge and interact with living

**LSD, 5HT, Dreams & Hallucinations**
- Damon had consumed LSD before the murder
- LSD blocks serotonin release and uptake (Bennett & Snyder, 1976; Gresch et al., 2002)
- Acts directly on amygdala and hippocampus (Bennett & Snyder, 1976; Gresch et al., 2002)
- Enhances perception: \"I was walking toward a park and stopped to touch a green leaf... I could taste it's greenness through my fingers\"

---

### LSD-Induced Sensory Alterations and Cerebral Hemisphere Activity
**LSD Experience and Hallucinations**
- First hour of LSD experience: saw sound waves, tasted colors, and perceived objects beyond Santa Cruz mountains
- No hallucination after removing temporal lobes, amygdala, or hippocampus
- Dreaming sometimes abolished with right but not left temporal lobe removals
- Penfield and Perot report vivid hallucinations triggered from right not left temporal lobe
- LSD structurally similar to serotonin but acts as antagonist, blocks 5-HT secretion and receptors
- Prevents serotonin from exerting inhibitory effects on sensory reception and multi-modal processing
- Acts on brainstem raphe nucleus which produces serotonin, preventing inhibitory influences in amygdala, pons, lateral geniculate, and visual cortex
- Affects frontal lobes exerting controls over the rest of the brain and sensory processing through inhibition
- Reduces inhibition throughout the brain, allowing neurons that normally filter information to process it again.

**Day Dreams vs. Hallucinations**
- Definitions: Perception without external stimulus and compelling sense of reality for hallucinations; day dreams based on external stimulation and freed from inhibitory restraint.
- Dismissal of LSD experience as a hallucination fails, as it's not the drug inducing the experience but reduced 5-HT.
- Cycle of right hemisphere peak activity and left hemisphere nadir during day and night; both day dreams and LSD associated with increased right hemisphere activation.
- Complex hallucinations typically follow right rather than left cerebral lesions or seizure activity.
- Direct stimulation of neocortex and amygdala also produces complex hallucinations.

---

### Near-Death Experiences and Hallucinations in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy
**Temporal Lobe Hallucinations**
* Patients may experience hallucinations of various objects and people, both ordinary and extraordinary (Joseph 1996; Daly 1958; Gloor 1992; Horowitz et al. 1968; Taylor 1972; Trimble 1991; Wearing et al. 1977; Williams 1956)
* Hallucinations may be induced by heightened activity or disturbances in temporal lobes, amygdala, and hippocampus (Bear 1979; Slater & Beard 1963)
* Often described as otherworldly or entering another reality (Daly 1958; MacLean 1990; Penfield & Perot 1963; Williams 1956)
* Some patients report communing with spirits, angels, gods, receiving profound knowledge (Daly 1958; MacLea n 1990; Penfield & Perot 1963; W illiams 1956)
* Hallucinations may include vivid images of threatening men, naked women, sexual intercourse, demons, ghosts, pigs walking upright dressed as people (Bear 1979; Gloor 1992; Horowitz et al. 1968; Taylor 1972; Trimble 1991)
* Feelings of elation, security, eternal harmony, immeasurable joy, paradisiacal happiness, euphoria, completion (Williams 1956; Daly 1958)
* Complex and unusual hallucinations are most commonly linked to temporal lobe involvement (Mall et al. 1964; Horowitz et al. 1968; Penfield & Perot 1963; Tarachow 1941)
* Hippocampus and amygdala, in conjunction with the temporal lobe, are responsible agents for generating hallucinations (Gloor 1992, 1997; Halgren et al. 1978)

**Out-of-Body Experiences and Near Death**
* Some individuals who have been clinically dead but later returned to life report leaving their body and floating above the scene (Eadie 1992; Joseph 1996; Rawling 1978; Ring 1980)
* Typically become increasingly euphoric as they float above their body, then may enter a soothing radiant light (Budge 1994)
* When returning to life, some patients claim conscious knowledge of what occurred around their bodies while they were dead and floating nearby
* Similar experiences detailed in ancient Egyptian funeral texts and modern accounts (Eadie 1992; Joseph 1996; Rawling 1978; Ring 1980)
* Case example: Lisa, a college student who survived a car accident, reported being detached from her body and floating up and down hospital corridors, watching doctors and nurses attend to her (Williams 1956).

---

### Out-of-Body and Fear-Induced Hallucinations in Near-Death Experiences
**Near Death Experiences (NDX)**
- Lisa's NDE: tripped out, saw self in emergency room with bloody hair, floating above body but not afraid or upset
  - Enveloped in total blackness and light, heard grandmother's voice
  - Recognized grandmother despite no memory, felt happy but had to return to body
- Common elements of NDEs: out-of-body experience, seeing events below, conversation recall
- Historical record: Egyptian Book of the Dead, Tibetan Book of the Dead, Wilson (1987), Sabom (1982)
- Approximately 37% of resuscitated patients report similar experiences

**Individual Cases:**
- Army Specialist J.C. Bayne: saw own body from above after death in Vietnam, witnessed events and conversations
  - Reports seeing filthy light fixture but may have been hallucinating
- Unnamed patient: detached observation of accident scene, no memory of sounds or conversations
- Blind individuals can experience NDEs with visual hallucinations

**Fear and Out-of-Body Experiences (OBE)**
- Extreme fear often accompanies potential for injury or death
- Individuals may report feeling detached from body, dissociation, depersonalization
  - Splitting of consciousness: inside controlling car while outside observes situation
- Perceptual and hallucinogenic experiences can occur during near death situations.

---

### Evolution of Consciousness and Hallucination in Humans
**The Nexus Between Out-of-Body Experiences and Hippocampal Functioning**

**Observations:**
- Individuals report leaving their bodies during extreme fear, observing themselves from above (Noyes and Kletti, 1977)
- Hippocampus plays a role in cognitive mapping and visualization of environment (Nadel, 1991; Joseph, 1996; OKeefe, 1976; Wilson and McNaughton, 1993)
- Place neurons within the hippocampus encode position and movement in space
- Hyperactivation of amygdala-hippocampus-temporal lobe complex can result in hallucinations, such as feeling detached from body or observing oneself (Daly 1958; Jackson and Stewart 1899; Joseph, 1996; Penfield 1952; Penfield and Perot 1963; Williams 1956)
- Reports of individuals dreaming about future events, including deaths and tragedies (Barker 1967; Jung 1945, 1964; Wiseaman 2011)

**Questions:**
- Is it a hallucination if an individual experiences dissociation of consciousness and observes from outside their body?
- Can accurate recall of events be evidence for the authenticity of these experiences?
- Why would the brain evolve capabilities that are suppressed or underutilized, such as out-of-body experiences or dreaming about future events?

**The Evolution of Dream Consciousness:**
- Similar dreams and hallucinations reported across cultures throughout history
- Brain evolution may play a role in explaining these experiences (Joseph 1996, 2000, 2001)
- Cro-Magnon humans had larger brains compared to modern humans and created art
- Language capabilities evolved gradually from primitive manifestations to complex conversational skills
- Human brain may continue to evolve or de-evolve depending on technological advancements.

## 40. Altered Consciousness Is A Many Splendored Thing
**Altered States of Consciousness (ASC)**

**Discussion**:
- Questioning assumptions about ASC being negative or delusional compared to Ordinary State of Consciousness (OSC)
- Emotional reactions against ASC discussions
- Three main arguments against ASC:
  1. Against what's normal and rational
  2. Personal and social costs, e.g., drug addiction
  3. Delusional account of reality compared to OSC

**Ordinary vs. Altered States**:
- Relativity of normality in different societies
- Example: Mbuti of Congo's consciousness transformation
- Rationality of beliefs based on empirical evidence and metaphysical axioms
- Destructive consequences of ASC misuse
- Vast majority of atrocities planned during OSC

**Perception vs. Reality**:
- Perceptual illusions distorting stimuli
- Physiological habituation
- Limited perception channels compared to other species
- Emotions and cognitions biased towards self-serving evaluations

**Psychology Research Findings**:
- ASC not inherently dysfunctional, but can be harmful when misused
- Evidence that unusual experiences are not necessarily indicative of dysfunction (Cardea et al., 2000; Moreira-Almeida & Cardea, in press)
- Hellish ASC encountered in mental disorders like schizophrenia or during ritual use for sinister purposes.

**Critique**:
- Challenges the notion that ASC create delusional beliefs while OSC does not
- Goes against centeries' critiques of naive realism, both in the West and East
- Contradicts research on perception, cognition, and personality (Ornstein, 1986; Greenwald, 1980).

---

### Altering Consciousness for Personal Growth and Wellbeing
**Western and Eastern Spiritual Ascriptions**
- Perceiving world through a \"glass darkly\" or \"veil of maya\" is consistent with psychological and neuroscientific research
- Evolution produces beings that approximate reality rather than creating very accurate representations
- Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) barely suspend or disrupt our consensual common sense ways of constructing reality
- Cannot state the ontological status of ASC alternatives a-priori

**Purposes to Alter Consciousness**
- Main purposes inspired by multidisciplinary contributions to the study of ASC
- 90% of cultures throughout history have established forms to attain ASC (often during well-developed rituals)
- Suggests they have considered them positive rather than delusional

**Examples of Altering Consciousness**
- Shamanism: Controlled practice in hunting-gathering societies
- Eastern spiritual traditions: Codified meditation techniques to alter consciousness
- Performance disciplines, martial arts, sexual practices, etc.
- Western techniques: From prehistoric cave use to technology

**Why We Seek to Alter Consciousness**
- One third of human life spent in sleep states
- Humans have used biologically given resources to affect consciousness
- Five functions of altering consciousness:
  - Make small adjustments to be more effective
  - Enhance the experience of life
  - Explore nonfactual possibilities that may be actualized
  - Increase sense of meaningfulness in life and heal differently
  - Obtain alternate epistemological routes to comprehend ourselves and the universe

---

### Enhancing Life Meaning and Healing Through Altered States of Consciousness
**Psychedelics and Altered States of Consciousness (ASC)**

**Experiences and Effects:**
- Enhance sensual experiences: taste, touch, sight (Krippner, 1970)
- Novel ways to perceive or express reality
  - Fantasy important for cognitive development (Gopnik, 2009)
- Creativity enhancement
  - Artists and writers use ASC as inspiration
- Improve the meaningfulness of life
  - Increase in harmony, compassion, and purpose
    - NDEs: enhanced sense of connection with others (Greyson, 2000)
    - Psilocybin session led to better relationships (Griffiths et al., 2006)
- Healing properties
  - Traditional association with shamanic practices (Winkelman, in press)
  - Reports of spontaneous remissions and improved health (Krippner & Achterberg, 2000)

**Psychedelics vs. Expectations:**
- Hallucinogenic effects not the only goal
  - Seeking enhancement of sensory experiences or creativity

**ASC in Art and Science:**
- Artists use ASC for inspiration (Van Gogh, Levy)
- Scientific breakthroughs linked to ASC (Loewi, Elias Howe)

**ASC Techniques:**
- Hypnosis and meditation shown to have therapeutic effects (Horowitz, 2010; Mendoza & Capafons, 2009)
- Connection between ASC techniques and positive outcomes still being researched.

---

### Exploring the Reality-Altering Potential of Altered States of Consciousness
**The Role and Significance of Alternative Self-World Representations (ASC)**

**Disrupting Maladaptive Patterns**
- Mishara and Schwartz propose ASC may disrupt maladaptive psychobiological patterns and bring about symptom improvement or better understanding

**Providing Valid Knowledge About Reality**
- Controversial claim: Some ASC provide valid knowledge beyond ordinary consciousness
- Discussions on the philosophical implications of ASC for ontology, epistemology, and metaphysics (Plato, Descartes)
- ASC may:
  - Consolidate and organize recently acquired information
  - Provide insights into opaque aspects of cognition
  - Reveal the architecture of consciousness through meditation practices
- Traumatic dreams can indicate unascertained physical conditions (e.g., heart damage)

**Unity with All There Is: A Complementary View on Reality**
- Reports from mystics, artists, psychologists, neuroscientists, and quantum physicists suggest a general sense of unity with all things
- The One remains while the many change; everything is part of an undivided wholeness in flowing movement
- Research on parapsychological phenomena suggests consciousness exists beyond time and space constraints, often during ASC
- Connection between consciousness and the universe: World can be found not only in a grain of sand but in the state of consciousness intuiting that connection.

## 41. Quantum Physics and the Multiplicity of Mind Split-Brains Fragmented Minds Dissociation Quantum Consciousness
**Quantum Physics, Relativity, and the Multipplicity of Mind**

**Introduction:**
- Einstein's theories of relativity challenge singularity of observer and reality
- Quantum physics assumes observer as a singularity
- Uncertainty principle: more precisely one property known, less precise others

**Challenges to Singularity:**
- Observer has multiple streams of consciousness
- Each stream perceives its own reality

**Copenhagen Model in Physics:**
- Reality created through observing and measuring
- Knowing influences nature by collapsing wave function

**Implications for Multiple Realities:**
- Discontinuous change in probability function with act of registration
- Perception of structural units of information inserted into quantum state, causing reduction of wave-packet and collapse of wave function
- Reality a manifestation of alterations in electromagnetic field patterns perceived as discontinuous

**Challenges to Singularity (cont'd):**
- Multiple realities: possibility of multiple consciousnesses and observers
- Each reality created by its own mind, creating potential for different interpretations or perceptions of reality.

---

### Quantum Reality and Duality in the Copenhagen Model
**Concept of Reality Beyond Quantum State**
- Heinserber g (1958): proposed potential reality and actual realities exist beyond quantum state
- Subatomic particles do not truly exist, only have probable existences
- Display tendencies to assume certain patterns of activity, creating shape and form
- Perception of mass is dynamic patterns of energy within the continuum of quantum state

**Observers in Quantum Theory**
- Copenhagen model: observer external to observed system, not part of collapse function
- Reality becomes duality (observer and observed) with potential to become multiplicity
- DeWitt and Graham's interpretation: reality is composed of many worlds, each with definite results

**Mind and Consciousness in Quantum Theory**
- Mind not a singularity, possesses multiple aspects capable of knowing different realities simultaneously
- Human brain functionally specialized, different mental states located in specific areas
- Differential processing of identical experiences by various brain regions.

---

### Multiplicity of Mind and Perception in Quantum Mechanics
**Multiplicity of Mind and Reality**

**Orthodox Quantum Mechanics and Cartesian Dualism**:
- Orthodox quantum mechanics appears concordant with Cartesian dualism, but this is an illusion
- Cartesian duality assumes singularity of mind, when the overarching organization of the mind and brain is both dualistic and multifaceted

**Quantum Physics vs. Reality**:
- If quantum physics is mind-like (actual/operational at the quantum level, but mentalistic on a logical level), it's not a duality but a multiplicity
- The concept of duality is imposed on reality by the dominant dualistic nature of the brain and mind, which subordinates both reality and the multiplicity of minds within the human brain

**Von Neumann's Formulation of Quantum Mechanics**:
- Von Neumann postulated that physical aspects of nature are represented by a density matrix
- This matrix could be conceptualized as a subset of potential realities, which can be averaged to determine the state of the universe/reality
- However, Von Neumann shifted the observer (his brain) into the quantum universe and made it subject to quantum rules
- Von Neumann's mental singularity imposes itself on reality, such that each event in reality corresponds to a specific experience of the singularity mind

**The Multiplicity of Mind and Perception**:
- The brain and mind are not a singularity but a multiplicity
- Perceptual functions are not eliminated from the brain, but prevented from interfering with the attentional processes of the dominant aspect of the multiplicity of mind
- **Sensory Inputs**: Transmitted to various subnuclei in the thalamus and then transferred to the neocortex
- **Consciousness**: Associated with the new brain (neocortex)
- **Frontal Lobes**: Monitor all perceptual/sensory activity, maintain focus of attention, and can inhibit additional processing in primary areas

---

### Disconnected Consciousness and Denial of Blindness in Brain Injuries
**Brain Function and Consciousness:**

**Left Frontal Lobe (Broca's Area):**
- Associated with verbal expression and speaking abilities
- Disconnection from other language areas may result in conduction aphasia, where one aspect of consciousness knows what to say but the speaking aspect cannot access it

**Right Hemisphere Disconnection:**
- Patients may be unable to name objects they hold out of sight or pick them up without being able to describe them
- Part of the brain and mind acts purposefully, while another is denied access to information

**Visual Consciousness:**
- Traveling from eyes to thalamus and midbrain
- Once in neocortex of occipital lobe, consciousness of visual word is achieved
- Destruction of this area results in cortical blindness

**Conscious Mind Denial:**
- Even with destruction of the visual lobe, conscious mind may deny being blind
- This denial occurs because other mental systems are uninformed about the loss of visual consciousness.

---

### Body Image and Consciousness Phantom Limbs and Bodily Neglect
**Blind Sight and Body Consciousness:**

**Samel Phenomenon with Small Strokes Destroying Part of Occipital Lobe**
- Patients may lose a quarter or even half of their visual field
- Unaware of the lost vision due to lack of consciousness in affected area

**Blind Sight (Blind Sigth)**
- Even with complete destruction of visual neocortex, some patients demonstrate non-conscious awareness of visual environment
- Older cortical (brainstem-thalamus) visual awareness dominates neocortical consciousness in humans
- Reptiles, amphibians, and fish do not have neocortex; their visual input is processed in midbrain and thalamus
- Humans receive this information in brainstem and thalamus before it reaches the neocortex
- Patients may report a feeling that something has moved even though they can't name or see what it is

**Body Consciousness: Phantom Limbs**
- All tactile and physical sensory impressions go to brainstem and thalamus, then neocortex of parietal lobe
- Entire image of body represented in parietal lobes (right and left halves)
- More neocortical space devoted to hands and fingers due to importance of somatosensory information
- Victims of traumatic amputation maintain consciousness of missing limb, called phantom limbs
- Continue to feel as if the arm or leg is still attached despite evidence to the contrary
- Can experience pain associated with trauma that led to amputation, called phantom limb pain
- Mental system of parietal lobe preserves body image and consciousness even when parts are missing.

---

### Brain Hemisphere Domains and Consciousness Division
**Split Brains and Split Minds**

**Dissociation of Consciousness**
- Patients deny ownership of limbs, insisting they belong to others (Joseph, 1986b, 1988a)
- Right parietal lobe destroyed: language-dependent mind unable to become conscious of left half of body
- Language axis relies on erroneous information from other sources, leading to confabulation and multiple minds in one head (Joseph, 1982, 2000; Joseph et al., 1984)

**Split Brains and Split Minds: More Than Language Dependent Consciousness**
- Multiplicity of mind includes social consciousness, emotional consciousness, and other mental realms (Joseph, 1982, 1986a,b, 1988a,b, 1992, 1999a)
- Different brain areas control specific functions: limbic system (emotion), frontal lobes (rational thought), inferior temporal lobes (memory), and left and right hemispheres for consciousness and awareness (Joseph, 1982, 1986a,b, 1988a,b)

**Right Hemisphere Dominance**
- Social and emotional functioning dominant in the right cerebral hemisphere
- Perception, expression, and mediation of almost all aspects of social and emotional language and memory (Joseph, 1982, 1986a,b, 1988a,b)
- Dominate for most aspects of visual-spatial perceptual functioning, recognition of faces including one's own face in the mirror, and personal body image (Joseph, 1988a, 1996; Joseph et al., 2000)
- Recognition of one's own body tied to personal identity (Joseph, 1986b, 1988a)
- Perceiving and analyzing visual-spatial relationships, movement of the body in space (Joseph, 1982, 1988a)
- Domain for environment sounds, social emotional musical aspects of language, ability to sing, curse or pray (Joseph, 1982, 1988a)
- Imparts sounds of sarcasm, pride, humor, love into speech and determines if others speak with sincerity, irony, or evil intentions.

**Left Hemisphere Dominance**
- Language dependent mind associated with the left hemisphere (Joseph, 1982, 1996)
- Expressive and receptive speech, linguistic knowledge and thought, mathematical and analytical reasoning, reading, writing, temporary-sequential and rhythmical aspects of consciousness (Joseph, 1982, 1988a).

---

### Duality of Consciousness Split-Brain Effects on Decision-Making and Motor Control
**Overlap in Functional Representation between Left and Right Hemispheres**
- Some overlap exists in functional representation
- Two mental systems interact and assist each other
- Examples: Understanding a question vs determining underlying meaning

**Limited Transfer of Information between Hemispheres**
- Each mental system is unique, speaks different language
- Not all information can be transferred or understood by the other hemisphere
- Cannot always communicate effectively

**Independent Mental Systems with Different Goals and Desires**
- Act independently of each other
- Have distinct realities following split-brain surgery

**Split-Brain Surgery Demonstration of Two Independent Minds**
- Reveals separate spheres of consciousness
- Perception, cognition, volition, learning, memory affected

**Right Hemisphere vs. Left Hemisphere Domains**
- Right hemisphere controls left body and visual space
- Left hemisphere domain is right body and visual space

**Imprecise Knowledge following Split-Brain Surgery**
- Each half may know different aspects of reality
- No singularity of mind

**Normal Brain's Multiplicity of Minds**
- Difficulty making decisions
- Internal conflicts over love/hate relationships
- Indecision even when faced with simple choices

**Split-Brain Patients' Challenges in Cooperating Their Hemispheres**
- Extreme difficulties coordinating bimanual activities
- Uncontrollable acts leading to irritation and depression
- Difficulty shopping due to conflicting hand actions
- Unexpected diversion of course, potentially leading to embarrassment or undesired outcomes
- Sudden striking or choking by left hand, requiring intervention from right hemisphere.

---

### Multiple Mental Systems in Split-Brain Patients and Beyond
**Split Brain Patients' Experiences of Interhemispheric Conflict:**
- Almost all complete commissurotomy patients exhibited some degree of interhemispheric conflict (Bogen, 1979)
- Examples:
  - Patient Rocky: hands uncooperative; right hand buttons shirt, left undoes it
  - Patient referred to left hemisphere as \"my little sister\" due to independent actions
  - Left hand slapped face to wake up patient (Joseph, 1988a)
  - Violent behaviors towards self and others by left hand (Joseph, 1988b)
  - Differences in preferred TV programs and foods
  - Physical struggles between left and right hands
- Conflicts not limited to behavior, but feelings: love and romance
  - Right hemisphere enjoyed seeing an ex-girlfriend again; left hand thumbs down (Joseph, 1988b)
  - Smoking conflict: right hemisphere enjoyed cigarettes, left hand wouldn't allow it

**Mental Systems within Brain:**
- Each half of the brain contains multiple minds and mental systems
- Differences in attitudes, goals, interests
- Conflicts over TV programs, food choices (Joseph, 1988b)
- Similar conflicts exist for individuals without split-brain surgery

**Disconnection between Hemispheres:**
- Difficulty in understanding why one hemisphere behaves a certain way
- Physical struggles between left and right hands during tasks (Joseph, 1988b)
- Left hemisphere may strike or hate its own left hand in frustration

**Limbic System's Role:**
- Old cortical structures, such as limbic system, contribute to mental systems
- Amygdala and hippocampus interact with neocortex creating additional mental systems (Joseph, 1992)
- Involved in self-reflection, personal identity, and self-consciousness (Joseph, 1992, 1998, 1999b, 2001)
- Enable individuals to visualize and remember themselves from an external perspective.

---

### Out-of-Body Dissociative Experiences and Fear-Induced Hippocampus Hyperactivation
**Hippocampus and Out-of-Body Dissociative Experiences**

**Place Cells in Hippocampus**:
- Cognitive map of environment
- Responsive to movements of objects within the environment
- Responsive to movements of people in the environment (Nadel, 1991; OKeefe, 1976; Wilson & McNaughton, 1993)

**Hippocampus Stimulation and Out-of-Body Experiences**:
- Electrode stimulation or other forms of heightened activity in the hippocampus and temporal lobe can cause:
  - Person to see themselves as if their conscious mind is floating above the body
  - Consciousness and sense of personal identity to appear detached from the body
- Patients may report:
  - Feeling of floating or drifting outside the body
  - Entering into the homes of others
- During extreme trauma, stress, and fear, the amygdala, hippocampus, and temporal lobe become hyperactive
- Out-of-body dissociative experiences appear to be due to fear-induced hippocampus (and amygdala) hyperactivity

**Out-of-Body Dissociative Experiences**:
- Personal consciousness may be fragmented
- Patients may experience themselves as splitting off and floating away from the body, passively observing all that is occurring
- Numerous individuals, including those born blind and deaf, have reported such experiences after profound injury causing near death
- Examples:
  - Army Specialist J. C. Bayne's out-of-body experience after being killed in Vietnam (Wilson, 1987; Sabom, 1982)

---

### Quantum Consciousness and Multiple Minds Perception of Reality
**Consciousness and Quantum Unity**

**The Distinction Between Consciousness and Objects of Consciousness**
- Consciousness is not an object or chair, but rather consciousness of something
- Knowing what it isn't helps define what it is
- This \"collapse function\" results in discontinuity within the continuum

**Consciousness of Consciousness and Duality**
- Self-consciousness introduces a duality or separation into the quantum state
- Consciousness can become abstracted from its body, leading to dissociation
- Dissociated consciousness is not dissociated from itself as a consciousness
- It experiences no collapse function except in regard to the physical body

**Consciousness and Unity in Dissociative States**
- In dissociative states, consciousness may merge with quantum unity
- Patients report experiencing cosmic awareness and loss of individuality
- Dissociated consciousness could be a step towards achieving quantum consciousness

**The Multiplicity of Mind**
- Each mental system has its own reality, capable of observing and becoming blind to objects
- Non-local properties that don't exist objectively may become observed by another mental system
- Quantum laws apply to everything, even the multiplicity of mind
- Uncertainty arises due to dominant parallel streams of conscious awareness

**Observers and the Collapse Function**
- The observer can be both internal and external to the described system
- Multiple mental systems perceiving an object lead to different realities and measurements
- Contrary to standard interpretations, states can have both definite position and momentum simultaneously
- The mind is capable of becoming one with the continuum and achieving singularity

## 42. Consciousness and Quantum Physics A Deconstruction of the Topic
**Consciousness and Quantum Physics:** A Decentered Construction of Topic

**Introduction**:
- No agreed definition of consciousness (40 definitions identified)
- Need for more specificity in discussion, especially with quantum physics
- Unresolved controversies: measurement problem in quantum physics and qualia problem in philosophy
- Discussion may not be productive if consciousness is poorly defined

**Consciousness as Socialized Knowing**:
- Originated from Latin \"conscieri\" meaning to know together
- Originally cognitive emphasis, internalization of social knowledge
- Expanded meaning includes perception and qualia (sensory experiences)
- Ambiguity and subtext in the term can complicate discussions with physics

**Consciousness and the Measurement Problem**:
- Conscious observation required to resolve measurement problem in quantum physics
- Phenomenality depends on observer's consciousness
- Metaphysical implications raise questions about the nature of reality

**Quantum Brain Theory as Potential Rescuer**:
- Attempts made to explain how quantum brain mechanisms generate consciousness
- Challenges arise from definability problem for consciousness, qualia problem, and measurement problem controversies.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Consciousness is a complex and ill-defined concept
- Discussion of consciousness in relation to quantum physics requires careful consideration of meanings and contexts
- Unresolved issues around consciousness bring metaphysical implications that challenge the physical realm's principles.

---

### Dis-Closure Quantum Brain Dynamics and World Appearance
**Deconstructing Consciousness in Quantum Physics**

**Terminology:**
- Dis-closure instead of consciousness
- Between-two as a new concept of ontological duality

**Background:**
- Brutal consequences of trying a fresh start
- Loss of the world-in-common and physical reality
- Multiple parallel disclosures of phenomenal worlds

**Thermofield Brain Dynamics:**
- Origins in quantum brain dynamics of Umezawa et al. (late 60s)
- Symmetry breaking in ground state offers mechanism for memory
- Boson condensation preserves broken symmetry
- Jibu and Yasue's extension into full-fledged quantum brain dynamics
- Vitiello's thermofield brain dynamics: consciousness as match between dual modes (system mode & environment mode)
- New version of ontological duality: between-two, indissolubly coupled

**Implications:**
- No physical reality or common world
- Primary is distinctionless abground, Being appears through action on it
- Monadological disclosure varies in content across waking, dreaming and sleeping

**Between-Two:**
- Indissoluble coupling of dual modes: no one without the other
- Primary is their relationship, not individual components
- No consensus on sensory offerings or individual preferences

**Comparison to Multiple Worlds Theory:**
- Agreement among observers regarding results but no world-in-common
- Consensus to extent of comparable memory and actions across brains
- Monadological but distinct from Leibniz's monadology

**Brain States:**
- Well-formed slow wave sleep: disclosure closer to inanimate objects
- Active REM sleep: revival of between-two with participation of other action inhibited
- Dream life disclosed: function of residual self-actions and retraces.

---

## 43. Logic of Quantum Mechanics and Phenomenon of Consciousness
**Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness**

**The Phenomenon of Consciousness**:
- Explained based on Quantum Mechanics in Everett's Interpretation (EI)
- Quantum reality is a set of \"alternative classical realities\" or alternatives, which are classical projections that are incompatible but equally real
- These alternatives are perceived separately by humans, resulting in the subjective illusion of only a single classical alternative existing

**The Ability to Separate Alternatives as Consciousness**:
- The ability to separate these \"alternative classical realities\" is the main feature of what we call consciousness
- This allows access to all alternatives when consciousness is turned off (e.g., sleeping, trance, meditation)
- Leads to unexpected insights, including scientific insights

**Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness**:
- The idea of connecting consciousness with quantum mechanics was suggested by physicists like Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Gustav Jung
- Physicist Roger Penrose suggested that quantum phenomena are essential for explaining the workings of the brain and consciousness
- The author's approach is based on the logical structure of Quantum Mechanics, rather than analyzing processes in the brain
- Consciousness arises from specific features of the concept of reality in Quantum Mechanics

---

### Quantum Parallel Worlds The Everett Interpretation
**Quantum Mechanics and the Many-Worlds Interpretation**

**The Everett Interpretation**:
- Proposed by Hugh Everett III in the 1950s
- Enthusiastically accepted by physicists John Archibald Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt, but not widely recognized until the late 20th century
- Explains the phenomenon of consciousness

**Key Points**:
- Quantum states are vectors, allowing for superposition and coexistence of alternative states
- Even macroscopic systems (e.g., measuring devices) can be in a superposition of incompatible classical states
- This implies the coexistence of parallel or alternative classical realities, called \"Everett worlds\" or \"parallel worlds\"
- The author's Extended Everett Concept suggests that consciousness is the ability to perceive these parallel worlds separately

**Arguments for the Everett Interpretation**:
- Quantum states can be a sum (superposition) of other states, with all counterparts being equally real and coexisting
- Experimentally proven for microscopic systems, but should also apply to macroscopic systems
- Classically incompatible or alternative states must coexist as parallel worlds due to quantum mechanics

---

### Everetts Many-World Interpretation Separation of Consciousness and Alternative Perceptions
**Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation (EMI)**

**Classical Reality vs. Quantum Reality**:
- In the quantum world, alternative classical realities may coexist as components of a superposition
- Subjectively, each observer perceives only a single classical alternative
- These two assertions seem to contradict each other

**Resolution in Everett's Interpretation (EI)**:
- The EI, based on the logic of quantum mechanics, claims that only the superposition of all alternatives objectively exists
- This presentation of objective reality as a set of coexisting classical realities expresses the quantum character of reality
- The single classical alternatives represent various subjective perceptions in an observer's consciousness

**Understanding Multiple Classical Pictures**:
- The difficulty lies in how the multiplicity of classical pictures in consciousness can be compatible with the sensory evidence of a single picture
- DeWitt's suggestion: Each observer exists as a \"twin\" or clone in all Everett's worlds, perceiving corresponding alternative realities
- All twins embody the observer, each can be called \"I\"

**Extending the Everett Interpretation (EEC)**:
- The author proposed that consciousness is nothing more than the separation of alternatives
- This led to the development of the Extended Everett Concept (EEC), which simplifies the logical structure of quantum theory
- The EEC identifies the two primary concepts of consciousness and alternative separation, reducing it to a single concept.

---

### Accessing Alternative Realities through Unconscious State
**EEC Theory: Extended Everett's Concept (EEC)**

**Unconscious State and Access to Alternatives:**
- EEC includes one primary concept instead of two in the original EI theory
- Logical structure is simplified after extension
- Transparent indication for obtaining access to other alternatives

**Accessing Unconscious Information:**
- Access to enormous data base consisting of all classical alternatives
- Valuable information or knowledge unavailable in conscious state
- Obtained during unconscious states, not limited to sleeping or trance
- Virtual time machine metaphor: information from past and future

**Implications:**
- Rational inspirations and scientific insights possible
- Solutions to problems during relaxation and unexpected insights
- Super-intuition may be confirmed by morning awakening experiences

**Probabilistic Miracles:**
- Observer subjectively perceives one alternative reality at time t0
- Two classes of alternatives exist: event E happens in one, not the other
- Objective probability p is small but non-zero
- Subjective probability p may differ and be influenced by observer's preference.

---

### Quantum Consciousness and Probabilistic Miracles
**Extended Everett's Concept (EEC)**

**Key Points:**
- Identification of consciousness with the ability for living beings to classically perceive quantum reality
- Living beings can classically perceive multiple classical realities, necessary for life
- Bridge between material and ideal spheres: consciousness is common to both
- Relative objectiveness in EEC: some phenomena cannot be unambiguously assigned to one sphere
- Importance of absolute quantum coherence for conclusions derived from EEC

**Generalization of Theory:**
- Identification of consciousness with the ability of living beings to perceive quantum world classically
- All living beings, not just humans, have this ability
- Life develops in parallel across Everett's parallel worlds
- Existing vs. living are different concepts: existence determined by reasons; life partly determined by goals (survival)

**Philosophical Aspects:**
- Bridge between material world (natural sciences) and ideal world (humanities and spiritual doctrines)
- Unambiguous assignment of certain phenomena impossible due to relative objectiveness
- Difficulties in constructing a purely objective quantum theory, as consciousness is necessary for analysis
- Present stage of quantum theory marked as the second quantum revolution.

---

## 44. A Quantum Physical Effect of Consciousness
**Quantum Physical Effect of Consciousness**

**Background:**
- Relationship between quantum measurement and consciousness studied since founding of quantum mechanics
- Quantum measurement problem: hardest problem in modern physics, deep mystery
- Consciousness also a deep mystery for philosophy and science
- Two main viewpoints on connection between quantum measurement and consciousness
  - Observer's consciousness causes collapse or completes transition (von Neumann, London and Bauer, Wigner, Stapp, Penrose)
    - Understandable: observer involved in last phase of measurement, introspectively aware of perception results
  - Consciousness arises from objective wavefunction collapse (Penrose, Hameroff and Penrose, Hameroff)
    - Consciousness cannot be described algorithmically, non-computable as fundamental physical process
    - Elementary acts of consciousness realized as objective collapse, e.g., coherent superposition states in brain microtubules
- Common sense view: quantum-to-classical transition and consciousness essentially independent (Nauenberg)
  - Seems too plain to be intriguing at first sight
  - Permitting quantum superpositions of conscious perceptions leads to new result, a quantum physical effect of consciousness

**Quantum Effect of Consciousness:**
- Nonorthogonal quantum states cannot be distinguished by physical measuring device in standard quantum mechanics and dynamical collapse theories
- A conscious being can distinguish definite perception states and their quantum superpositions
  - Example: two definite perception states triggered by photons, superposition state is the combination of these inputs
- Slow collapse condition ensures consciousness can take part in wavefunction collapse process
  - Collapse time (tc) longer than normal conscious time (tp) for definite states and time difference large enough for identification.

**Implications:**
- Conscious being's ability to distinguish nonorthogonal quantum states reveals a distinct quantum physical effect of consciousness, lacking for physical measuring systems without consciousness.

---

### Quantum Consciousness Distinguishing Superposition States
**Quantum Effects of Consciousness**

**Assumption:**
- If conscious being in a superposition state cannot have definite perception before collapse, it can distinguish states with non-zero probability

**Proofs**:
1. **If the definite perception is a mixture of v1 and v2:**
   - Conscious being can directly distinguish states
2. **If the definite perception is always v1 or v2:**
   - Conscious being can distinguish states with 50% probability after collapse due to change in perception for v1 vs no change for v2
3. **If the definite perception is random:**
   - Conscious being can distinguish states with non-zero probability due to perception changes during collapse process
4. **Reduction to absurdity**:
   - Assuming conscious being cannot distinguish states, requires knowing collapse result beforehand which is impossible

**Condition**:
- The slow collapse condition depends on the model of consciousness and wavefunction collapse in human brains
- Collapse time for small perceptions may be similar to normal conscious time
- Some small brain creatures might satisfy slow collapse condition
- Collapse time for single superposition state can vary randomly between 0 and infinity
- The slow collapse condition is also applicable in many-worlds theory and de Broglie-Bohm theory.

---

### Quantum Consciousness and the Distinction of Nonorthogonal States
**Theories Comparison: Consciousness vs. Quantum Mechanics**
* **Many-Worlds Theory and De Broglie-Bohm Theory**
  + Closed conscious system satisfies linear Schrdinger equation, no apparent collapse or infinite decoherence time
  + Slow collapse condition more readily satisfied due to weak interaction with environment
* **Dynamical Collapse Theories**
  + Superposition state of a closed system collapses by itself
  + Strong interaction with environment leads to shorter decoherence time and less satisfaction of slow collapse condition
* **Implications of Consciousness**
  + Long-standing problem in explaining the relationship between physical process and subjective conscious experience
  + Panpsychism vs. Emergentism debate
  + Physical world is causally closed, but consciousness might present itself in investigation of physical world
* **Consciousness as a Fundamental Property**
  + Conscious observer can distinguish nonorthogonal states
  + Violates quantum principles and cannot be emergent or reducible
  + Nonlinearity introduced to complete evolution equation of wave function
  + Independent of origin of wavefunction collapse or interpretation of quantum mechanics
* **Argument for Panpsychism**
  + Distinction between nonorthogonal states indicates consciousness has causal effect in physical world
  + Consciousness might be a fundamental property of substance, possessed by all matter
  + New result may provide quantum basis for panpsychism.

## 45. The Conscious Observer in the Quantum Experiment
**Two-Slit Experiment: Conscious Observer and Quantum Theory**

**Introduction:**
- Inception of quantum theory revealed observer's role in physics
- Unresolved measurement problem
- Presenting a version of the two-slit experiment with conscious observer intrusion

**Quantum Measurement Problem:**
- Intrusion of conscious observer required for interpreting quantum phenomena
- Two contradictory aspects: wave properties vs particle properties
- Every interpretation relies on this assumption

**Two-Slit Experiment:**
1. **Archetypal Quantum Experiment**: displays the intrusion of the conscious observer in physics
2. **Description of Experiment:**
   - Objects exhibit wave or particle properties depending on observation technique used
   - Wave properties imply spread-out entity, particle properties not spread-out
   - Two-slit experiment demonstrates these contradictory aspects
3. **Quantum Theory Neutral Experiments:**
   - Describing experiments without quantum language
   - Objects in box pairs: one object per pair
   - Experimenter determines which box contains the object based on impact marks on a screen after opening each box separately or together (Which Box Experiment) or randomly (Interference Experiment)
4. **Implications:**
- Unresolved quantum measurement problem arises from both quantum theory and experiment
- Depends crucially on the assumption of free will of the experimenter.

---

### Quantum Experiment and Observers Free Choice Impact on Observed Outcome
**Experimental Findings and Observations:**
- In first set of box pairs, objects were wholly in a single box
- Objects followed rules based on spacing of their box pairs
- Experimenter's free choice influenced which experiment was conducted:
  - Choosing \"which box\" experiment established that objects were wholly in a single box for that set
  - Choosing interference experiment established contradictory physical situation, where objects were not wholly in a single box
- In classical physics, questions of free will only arose from deterministic theory's ignorable aspect

**Box Pair Experiment:**
- Objects sent towards mirror with equal transmission and reflection of wavefunctions
- Wavefunctions divided into regions for each box pair preparation
- Holding object in a box without disturbing its wavefunction is difficult but doable
- No actual physical capture of objects in boxes required for demonstration
- Box pairs conceptual device to emphasize conscious choice before observation

**Observation:**
- In which box experiment, wavefunctions spreed widely from small slit and impinge uniformly on detection screen
- Interference experiment: parts of wavefunction emerge simultaneously from both boxes, forming maxima and minima regions on detection screen
- Borng postulate has absolute square of wavefunction in region giving probability of observation there
- In Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, observation occurs as soon as microscopic object encounters macroscopic screen
- Other interpretations consider observation more involved with conscious experience of results.

**History and Quantum Theory:**
- Finding an object in a single box implies that it came on a particular path after earlier mirror encounter
- Choosing interference experiment would establish different history: aspects of object came on both paths to both boxes after mirror encounter
- Quantum cosmologist John Wheeler suggested testing history creation by delaying choice of experiment until after object made decision at semi-transparent mirror. Results would imply relevant history was created by later choice.

---

### Quantum Non-Locality and the Conscious Observer
**Quantum Experiment and Non-locality**
* Conscious choice of experiment takes less than a second
* Fast electronic switch used for random choices
* Results confirmed quantum theory predictions (Jacques et al., 2007)

**Observation and Collapse of Wavefunction**
* Objects appear to be in specific locations upon observation
* Wavefunction collapses to zero elsewhere, becomes certainty in observed location
* Problematic for special relativity as it allows faster-than-light information transfer
* Einstein's EPR paper challenged this concept (Einstein et al., 1935)

**Bell's Theorem and Non-locality Experiments**
* Experimental tests confirm instantaneous connectedness between objects
* Assumes free will of observers in making choices about what to observe
* Human evaluation of robot experiment reveals mystery with box pairs
* Replacement of robot's coin flipping with human choice establishes free will

**Implications and Conclusion**
* Extension of quantum mechanics implications beyond microscopic realm leads to absurd conclusions
* Undisputed experimental results, most basic theory in science (quantum theory)
* Intrusion of conscious observer through observation and collapse of wavefunction
* Difficulty resolving quantum measurement problem without underlying structure

## 46. Does Quantum Mechanics Require A Conscious Observer
**Quantum Mechanics and Conscious Observer**

**Background:**
- Misunderstanding of quantum mechanics' principles
- Originated with John von Neumann (1932)
- Spread by prominent physicists like Eugene Wigner (1984)
- Continuous discussion on role of conscious observer

**Keywords:** Quantum Physics, Wavefunction, Observer, Consciousness

**Misunderstandings:**
1. Meaning of quantum wavefunction
2. Role of measurement process in quantum mechanics

**Quantum Mechanics:**
- Statistical theory determining probabilities
- Fundamental quantity: wavefunction
  * Complex function dependent on system variables
  - Absolute square gives probability

**von Neumann's Contribution:**
1. Measurement devices must follow quantum mechanics principles
2. Wavefunctions of measuring devices and objects become entangled during measurement process
3. Superposition of en tangled wavefunctions continues to evolve according to quantum mechanics equations
4. Introduced von Neumann chain, leading to need for conscious observer to break it

**Bell's Perspective:**
- Believed in second alternative to von Neumann dilemma
  * Conscious observers not required by experimental facts
- Understood as simplified measuring devices causing misunderstanding due to limited degrees of freedom.

### Quantum Measurement Paradox and its Misconceptions
**Physics and Misconceptions about Quantum Mechanics**

**Recording Measurements**:
- Measuring device requires large number of degrees of freedom to record measurements permanently
- Recording occurs through time irreversible processes

**Irreversibility in Nature**:
- 19th century scientists argued this implied a failure of classical physics' time reversible laws
- Boltzmann resolved the paradox by considering macroscopic systems' large number of degrees of freedom
- Irreversibility property also applies to quantum systems and second law of thermodynamics

**Misconceptions about Wavefunctions**:
- Some argue wavefunction is a physical object like an atom, not just mathematical representation
- This would require a mechanism outside the principles governing time evolution of the wavefunction
- But wavefunction is an abstract function containing statistical information, not a physical object

**Quotes from Prominent Physicists**:
- **Feynman**: \"Nature doesn't know or care if you're observing\"
- **Gellmann**: \"The universe obeys quantum mechanical laws regardless of observation by physicists\"
- **Leggett**: \"Consciousness has nothing to do with the quantum process\"
- **Wheeler**: \"Measurement involves an irreversible act of amplification and registration\"
- **Bell**: \"Quantum mechanics is a technical theory, not integrated with consciousness or meaning\"
- **van Kampen**: \"Anything endowed with more meaning than needed for computing observable phenomena is the responsibility of the one who did it\"

**Schrdinger's Cat**:
- Schrdinger's thought experiment on a cat in a box connected to a radioactive nucleus and cyanide
- The cat should be in a superposition of life and death states, but never observed this way
- The expectation is that a camera would record the cat as alive until the unpredictable moment of decay

## 47. Quantum Physics Advanced Waves and Consciousness
**Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics**
- Formulated by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1927
- Explains dual nature of matter (wave/particle)
- Electrons leave the atomic cannon as particles, dissolve into waves of superposed probabilities
- The wave function collapses into a particle with observation
- Reality is created by the observer through consciousness

**Schrdinger's Wave Equation**
- Essential component of Copenhagen Interpretation
- Electrons seem to exist only when observed
- Reality is not defined until observation occurs

**Quantum Models of Consciousness**
- Can be categorized into three main groups:
  1. **Models that assume consciousness creates reality and is a prerequisite of it**: These models start from the Copenhagen Interpretation and assume that consciousness determines reality through panpsychism, an immanent property preceding the formation of reality. However, these assumptions cannot be falsified as they are not testable by modern science.
  2. **Models that link consciousness to probabilistic properties**: These models consider consciousness to be linked to a realm beyond modern science and impossible to test using experiments.
  3. **Models that attribute consciousness to principles of order already discovered**: These models attribute consciousness to well-defined physical principles, such as extreme temperatures like absolute zero. The order principles on which most of these models are based require specific conditions for application.

**Criticism and Limitations**
- Quantum models of consciousness in the first category may lead to mysticism.
- Models in the second category cannot be tested or falsified using modern science.
- Models in the third group attribute consciousness to principles that require extreme physical conditions for application.

### Laws of Retarded and Advanced Waves in Quantum Physics
**Klein-Gordon Equation and Quantum Mechanics**
* Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon formulated probability equation in quantum mechanics, relativistically invariant (1925)
* Schrdinger simplified it as wave equation (positive solution), treats time classically (1926)
* K-G equation unites Schrdinger's wave equation and special relativity's energy/momentum/mass equation (1927)

**Klein-Gordon Wave Equation**
* Depends on square root, yields two solutions: positive (retarded waves) and negative (advanced waves)
* Positive solution describes waves moving from past to future
* Negative solution introduces unacceptable teleological tendencies, considered irrelevant in physics

**Negative Energy Solution and Antiparticles**
* Dirac tried to eliminate unwanted negative solution by applying energy/momentum/mass equation (1928)
* Resulted in matter and antimatter moving forwards and backwards in time
* Negative solution empirically proven by Anderson with the discovery of positrons in cosmic rays (1932)
* Predicted universe made up of forward-moving matter and backward-moving antimatter, causing distress among physicists

**Solving Unwanted Solutions: Pauli's Principle and Dirac Sea**
* Pauli's principle suggested all negative energy states are occupied, forbidding interaction between positive and negative states (1928)
* Dirac sea refers to the ocean of negative energy which occupies all positive energy states
* Impossible to test existence of advanced waves in a physics laboratory due to classical experimental methods and time-symmetric model predictions identical with conventional results.

**Law of Syntropy vs. Entropy**
* Fantappi discovered that dual solution explains symmetrical laws: retarded (entropy) and advanced (syntropy) waves (end of 1941)
* Retarded waves: causality, entropy, dissipation of energy
* Advanced waves: retrocausality, syntropy, concentration of matter and energy.

**Importance of Entropy and Syntropy in Nature**
* Entropy leads to homogeneity and disorder (second law of thermodynamics)
* Time arrow inversion inverts second law, causing reduction in entropy and increase in differentiation
* Final causes or attractors absorb converging waves, leading to syntropic systems.

**Compensation of Syntropic Concentration through Entropic Processes**
* Metabolism consists of anabolism (syntropy) and catabolism (entropy)
* Anabolism transforms simple structures into complex ones with absorption of energy
* Catabolism converts higher-level structures into lower-level ones, releasing energy.

### Anticipatory Responses in Autonomic Nervous System Experimental Evidence
**Fantappi's Syntropy Model and Living Systems**

**Properties of Syntropy:**
- Coincides with qualities of living systems: finality, differentiation, order, and organization
- Law of syntropy suggested for living systems (Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, Erwin Schrdinger, Ilya Prigogine)

**Szent-Gyorgyi's View:**
- Increase in complexity in living systems defies second law of thermodynamics
- Life processes show decrease in entropy and increase in inner complexity
- Syntropy is the opposite law attracting living systems towards organization (1970s)

**Schrdingers Concept:**
- Negative entropy: nutrient that defends against heat death
- Feeding on neg-entropy through metabolic process

**Prigogine's Thermodynamics:**
- Introduced thermodynamics of dissipative systems for living organisms (1979)

**Haken's Ordinator:**
- Explained principles of orders in living systems using the concept of an ordinator (1983)

**Experiments and Anticipatory Reactions:**

**Di Corpos Extension:**
- Structures supporting vital functions, such as ANS, should show anticipatory reactions if AWI is correct

**Anticipatory Pre-stimuli Reactions in ANS:**
1. Radin (1997): Heart rate, skin conductance react before emotional pictures
2. Bierman (1997) and Spottiswoode & May (2003): Increase in skin conductance 2-3 seconds before emotional stimuli
3. McDonough et al. (2002), McCraty et al. (2004), May Paulinyi & Vassaly (2005), and Radin (2005): Similar results using various ANS parameters
4. Tressoldi et al. (2005): Anticipatory heart rate reactions in intuitive tasks
5. Daryl Bem: Retrocausality studies showing responses before stimulus events occur (2011)

### Quantum Physics and Consciousness Restoring Time Symmetry and Advanced Waves
**Priming Experiments**
- Subjects judge image as positive or negative, pressing button for response
- Reaction time (RT) measured
- Prime word shown before image: congruent vs noncongruent
- Shorter RTs with congruent primes
- Longer RTs with noncongruent primes

**Retro-Priming Experiments**
- Participants view emotional images through IAPS system
- Results show classical priming effect: faster RTs for congruent primes
- 9 experiments on over 1,000 students yield p=1.34x10^-11 effect size

**Pre-Stimuli Heart Rate Effects**
- Vannini and Di Corpo describe experiments controlling different types of artifacts
- Significant statistical significance of prestimuli heart rate effects (p=1/1027)

**CIRTS Model vs. Syntropy Model**
- Bierman's CIRTS model: brain sustains time symmetry and allows advanced waves with consciousness
  * Special property of restored time symmetry arises from nothing
  * Rationale behind consciousness missing
- Fantappi's syntropy model: life is a result of advanced wave properties
  * Living systems absorb energy and information
  * Consciousness as a consequence, not a precondition.

**Differences Between CIRTS and Syntropy Model**
1. Fantappi focused on Klein-Gordon equation and excluded other time-symmetric equations
2. In diverging systems (expanding universe), entropy prevails, time flows forward, advanced solutions impossible
3. In converging systems (black holes), syntropy prevails, time flows backward, retarded solutions impossible
4. Balanced systems (atoms): past, present, and future coexist; both advanced and retarded waves possible.
5. CIRTS model considers advanced solutions at macro level without considering entropy restrictions.

### Quantum Coherence and Consciousness Two Models Compared
**Fantappi's Discovery and Syntropy Model vs CIRTS**
- Fantappi found that living systems need advanced waves from quantum level for sustaining life functions
- He identified hydrogen bridge in water as mechanism for extracting advanced waves
- Water's cohesive properties make it essential to life due to the flow of advanced waves
- In Syntropy Model, advanced waves are a fundamental property of all living systems, not associated with brain
- CIRTS suggests consciousness mediates advanced waves and is a consequence of conscious brain activities

**Comparison between Models**
1. **Living Systems and Advanced Waves:**
   - Fantappi: Living systems need advanced waves from quantum level for life functions
   - Syntropy Model: Cohesive properties of advanced waves essential to life (syntropy)
2. **Role in Consciousness:**
   - Syntropy Model: Does not require consciousness as a pre-requisite or consequence
   - CIRTS: Consciousness is a pre-requisite of reality and mediates advanced waves
3. **Emotions and Reactions:**
   - Syntropy Model: Pre-stimuli reactions associated with feelings, emotions (not coherence)
   - CIRTS: Coherence required for understanding pre-stimuli reactions
4. **Dual Manifestation of Quantum World:**
   - Advanced Waves Model: Dual manifestation explained by dual causality at quantum level
   - CIRTS: Requires collapse of wave function, as per Copenhagen Interpretation
5. **Philosophical Significance**
   - Syntropy Model: Does not attribute creation powers to consciousness
   - CIRTS: Reflects the idea of humans as semi-Gods creating reality through consciousness (Zeitgeist)
6. **Heisenberg's Interpretation:**
   - Schrdinger's criticism of Heisenberg and Bohm's use of his wave equation for ideological implications.

**Measurement Challenges:**
- Coherence vs emotions: Emotions easier to measure than coherence
- Bierman's formula contradicted by heart rate measurements.

## 48. Consciousness and the Quantum
**Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism Framework:**
* Relates consciousness to a quantum universe
* Each conscious perception has a measure given by the expectation value of a corresponding quantum awareness operator in a fixed quantum state of the universe
* Measures can be interpreted as frequency-type probabilities for a large set of perceptions that all exist with varying degrees of reality, making theories within this framework testable
* No indeterministic elements or free will in the incompatibilistic sense
* Conscious perceptions are determined by awareness operators and quantum state, epiphenomena
* Not a many-minds framework but a many-perceptions framework
* Simple, elegant, precise theories preferred in physics often dismissed complex observations like consciousness as less real
* Author's personal viewpoint: conscious perceptions are the most fundamental observations in physics
* Taking quantum hypothesis as one of central working hypotheses
* Framework for integrating conscious perception and quantum theory called Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism.

### Quantum Theory and Consciousness A Mindless Sensationalism Framework
**Quantum Theory Formalism**

**Elements of Quantum Theory:**
- **Quantum Operators**: mathematical entities that can be adjointed, multiplied by complex numbers, added together or multiplied to form other operators. Examples include position (A) and momentum (B) operators.
- **Expectation Value**: a rule for assigning a complex number to each operator in a quantum state. [cA] = c[A], where A is an operator and c is a complex number.
- Properties of Expectation Values: [A + B] = [A] + [B], [I] = 1, and [AA]  0.

**Assumptions about Quantum Theory:**
- No fundamentally special role for time; it is just one of many labels for operators.
- Time evolution can be reformulated into the Heisenberg picture where operators change with time and quantum state stays fixed.

**Mindless Sensationalism Framework:**
- Framework based on Hume's idea that what we call a mind is a collection of different perceptions or sensations.
- Perception (or conscious experience) is the phenomenal perspective or maximal experience, not just the conscious responses to external stimuli.

**Conscious Experiences**:
- There is a countable discrete set M of all possible conscious experiences or perceptions.
- Not all conscious perceptions occur equally; each one has a normalized measure w(p) as associated with it, which sums up to unity for all p in the full set M.
- The weight w(p) can be interpreted as proportional to the probability of getting this particular experience if a random selection were made.

### Quantum Consciousness Connecting Conscious Perception and Quantum Awareness Operators
**Sensible Quantum Mechanics: Framework for Connecting Consciousness and Quantum Theory (Page, 2003)**

**Key Components:**
- **Quantum World Axiom**: The quantum world Q is described by a C *-algebra of operators O and a suitable state giving the expectation value [O] of each operator.
- **Conscious World Axiom**: The conscious world M has a fundamental measure w(p) for each perception p.
- **Psycho-Physical Parallelism Axiom**: The measure w(p) is given by the expectation value [A(p)] of a corresponding quantum awareness operator A(p) in the state of the quantum world.

**Assumptions:**
1. The set M of all conscious perceptions is countable and discrete.
2. The measure w(p) is normalized, p_w(p) = 1.
3. The psychophysical parallelism is linear.
4. No random or probabilistic elements in SQM or MS; consciousness may be an epiphenomenon.
5. Interpret the measures wi(pj) assigned by a theory Ti to conscious perceptions as probabilities for those perceptions given the theory.
6. Use Bayes' theorem to calculate posterior probability of a theory given an observation or conscious perception.
7. Develop theories that provide measures for conscious perceptions, not just observations.

**Framework Components:**
1. Algebra of quantum operators O.
2. Quantum state i.
3. Awareness operators Aj for each observation (or conscious perception in SQM or MS).
4. Expectation value i[Aj] in the quantum state given by the theory, representing probability of an observation Oj or conscious perception pj.

### Quantum Measurement Problems in Eternal Inflationary Universes
**Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism**

**Theory of Everything (TOE)**:
- Historically referred to as a \"Theory of Everything\"
- Part (1) includes the dynamical laws of physics, but it is not a complete theory

**Boundary Conditions and Quantum State**:
- Part (2) includes boundary conditions that specify the solution to the dynamical laws for our actual universe
- However, even with Parts 1 and 2, we still need Part (3)

**Probabilities of Observations**:
- Part (3) includes the rules for extracting probabilities from the quantum state
- Recognized as a major challenge in cosmology

**Measure Problem**:
- Theoretical frameworks like eternal inflation suggest the universe may have expanded to become infinitely large
- This leads to ambiguities in determining the number of occurrences of different observations
- Even in finite universes, quantum uncertainties can lead to ambiguities in observation probabilities

**Born Rule and Awareness Operators**:
- The Born rule does not work as it cannot be applied directly to the operators that determine observation expectations
- This leads to the \"measure problem\" of determining the \"awareness operators\"
- This challenge remains even with an infinitely large universe

**Proposed Framework**:
- Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism is a proposed framework for understanding the connection between consciousness and the quantum universe
- It would become a complete theory once we have the set of all conscious experiences, the awareness operators, and the quantum state

**Research Support**:
- The research was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

## 49. Quantum Reality and Mind
**Two Fundamental Questions Addressed in Orthodox Quantum Mechanics**

**First Purpose: Connection between Mind and Matter in Orthodox Quantum Mechanics**
- Explanation of the connection between mind and matter within the framework of orthodox quantum mechanics
- Dualistic on a pragmatic, operational level
- Nondualistic on a deeper ontological level

**Second Purpose: Reconciling Free Will with Sufficient Reason Principle**
- Resolving the issue of free will and determinism in a quantum world

**Introduction:**
- Two purposes: explain connection between mind and matter using Descartes, Newton, and James' ideas; reconcile free will with sufficient reason principle
- Describing contrasting ideals about the nature of reality from Descartes (duality), Newton (universal physical determinism), and James

**Descartes:**
- Dualistic notion of nature: mental part (res cogitans) and physical part (res extensa)
- Interaction between mental and physical aspects limited to human brains

**Newton:**
- Extended dynamic ideas down to atomic level, proposing universal physical determinism as a basic precept
- Classical physics formulated solely in terms of physically described variables

**Issue with Classical Physics:**
- No mention or explanation for experientially described aspects of nature, leading to a logical disconnect between mental realities and physical properties
- Collapses Descartes' duality into a nondualistic physical monism.

---

### Quantum Reality Dualistic Interaction and Potentiality in Orthodox Quantum Mechanics
**William James' Challenge to Classical Physics**
- William James (1892) challenged classical physics' claim of mind's impotence based on provisional natural science assumptions
- Classical physics was later proven wrong with the discovery of new constants in quantum mechanics
- Quantum mechanics introduced mind into basic conceptual structure, elevating it from observer to fundamental element

**Bohr and Heisenberg's Perspective on Reality in Quantum Mechanics**
- Purpose of science is not to disclose reality essence but only track relations between experiences (Bohr)
- Sole aim of quantum mechanics is comprehension of observations, not behavior of particles but human knowledge (Bohr and Heisenberg)
- Conception of objective reality of elementary particles evaporated into transparent mathematics representing our knowledge (Heisenberg)

**Von Neumann's Dualistic Quantum Mechanics**
- Formalized quantum mechanics, allowing it to be interpreted as a dualistic theory with mental realities interacting with the physical brain
- Addresses Cartesian dualism's criticism of distinct aspects of nature cohering by questioning ontological character of physical aspect in quantum mechanics

**The Ontological Character of Physical Aspect of Quantum Mechanics (von Neumann-Heisenberg)**
- Physical aspect represented by quantum state, which does not have material substance's continuous evolution or ontological character
- State has the ontological character of potentia: objective tendencies for actual events to happen
- Actual event occurs with registration in the observer's mind (Heisenberg)
- Physical aspects are more mind-like than matter-like due to represented probabilities and future projections.

### Quantum Mechanics Reason-Based Dynamics vs Physical Descriptions
**Conclusion: Orthodox Quantum Mechanics and Cartesian Dualism**
- Pragmatic level: Operates at a practical level, involving both physical and psychological aspects
- Ontological level: Fundamentally mind-like, with a focus on the unfolding reality where facts become definite

**Natural Processes, Sufficient Reason, and Human Freedom**
- Two ways to cope with relativity demands: Block Universe (fixed future) vs. Unfolding Universe (evolving reality)
- Subscribe to Unfolding Universe concept: reality conforms to the principle of sufficient reason
- Question if this precludes human freedom
  - Laplace's argument for certainty of future states
    * A powerful computing intellect knowing all laws and positions would have no uncertainty about the future
    * Laws of classical mechanics allow mathematical computation of future states with certainty
  - Reason vs. computable mathematics: reason is more encompassing than mathematical computation in quantum mechanics
- Human freedom not an illusion within orthodox quantum mechanics if reasons lack fantastic computability properties

**Reason-Based Dynamics vs. Physical Description-Based Dynamics**
- Arguments rely on the distinction between reason-based dynamics of unfolding universe (quantum mechanics) and physical description-based dynamics of block universe (classical mechanics)
- Von Neumann's formulation: physical aspects represented by evolving quantum mechanical state (density matrix) of the universe.

**Orthodox Quantum Mechanics and Cartesian Dualism:**
- Pragmatic level: operates at a practical level, involving both physical and psychological aspects
- Ontological level: fundamentally mind-like with an emphasis on unfolding reality where facts become definite.

### Quantum Mind-Brain Interaction in von Neumanns Dynamics
**Von Neumann's Dynamics and Quantum Mechanics**

**Process 1**:
- Corresponds to a person's choice as an agent or experimenter
- Mathematically, it differs from process 3
- Local in nature, effects only propagate at the speed of light
- Determines the initial conditions for process 2 evolution

**Process 2**:
- Generalization of causal process in classical mechanics
- Deterministic, state of universe completely determines future state
- Without process 1 or process 3 events, would result in a \"gigantic smear\" of the initial big bang state

**Process 3**:
- Nature's response to a localized process-1 action
- Can have observable statistical effects in a faraway contemporaneous region
- Constrained by a statistical condition: must be determined by sufficient reason
- Nonlocal in nature, the reason for a choice need not be located near the action

**Argument Against Physicalist Philosophers**:
- Determinism of classical mechanics disrupted by quantum mechanics randomness
- Physicalist argument that this doesn't resolve the mind-matter problem
- Flaws due to the fact that process 3 delivers nature's choice, while process 1 is man's choice (fixed by the deterministic aspect of quantum mechanics)

---

### Quantum Mechanics and Human Free Will Von Neumanns Interpretation
**Human Choices in Quantum Mechanics (Bohr and von Neumann)**

**Von Neumann's Perspective:**
- Human choice is free within quantum mechanics
- Represents Bohr's freedom to choose experimental arrangements

**Significance:**
- Human choices not determined by deterministic or random elements in the theory

**Bohr (1958, p. 51):**
- Introduced the idea of human choice in quantum mechanics
- Believed that quantum mechanical formalism allows for this freedom.
