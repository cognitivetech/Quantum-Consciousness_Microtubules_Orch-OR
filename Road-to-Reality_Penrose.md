# The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe

> Nobel Prize-winner Roger Penrose, one of the most accomplished scientists of our time, presents the only comprehensive—and comprehensible—account of the physics of the universe.
> 
> A "guide to physics’ big picture, and to the thoughts of one of the world’s most original thinkers.”—The New York Times
> 
> From the very first attempts by the Greeks to grapple with the complexities of our known world to the latest application of infinity in physics, The Road to Reality carefully explores the movement of the smallest atomic particles and reaches into the vastness of intergalactic space.
> 
> Here, Penrose examines the mathematical foundations of the physical universe, exposing the underlying beauty of physics and giving us one the most important works in modern science writing. - [The Road to Reality (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Reality-Complete-Guide-Universe/dp/0679776311/?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Prologue

**Prologue: The Discovery of Am-tep's Nightmare**

**Am-tep**:
- King's chief craftsman, an artist with consummate skills
- Slept restlessly one night, unsure if he was asleep or not
- Saw something strange in the north during the "dawn"

**The Red Light**:
- Not the Sun, but a distant shaft of deep fiery red light
- Appeared to be coming from the water and going upwards into the heavens
- A dark cloud appeared at the head of the beam, resembling a parasol or demonic figure
- The night had been clear, but the stars were disappearing one by one

**Am-tep's Reaction**:
- Initially transfixed by the scene's symmetry and beauty
- But then apprehension returned as he sensed strange disturbances in the ground
- Felt the noise and wind from an unseen force, causing damage to his workshop

**The Approaching Wave**:
- Seemed to be a vast trough of water moving rapidly towards the shore
- When it reached the beach, it shattered ships and destroyed nearby buildings
- Am-tep's house was spared, but the Great Palace was almost completely destroyed

**The Aftermath**:
- Am-tep vowed to leave the island, as his world had changed irreparably
- There had been a thousand years of peace, prosperity, and culture under the Earth-Goddess' reign
- The magnificent Great Palace had been nearly rebuilt, but Am-tep had lost faith in it.

---

#### Reflections on Cosmic Order: Ancestors' Questions and Pythagorean Thoughts

**Am-tep's Revelation:**
- War was unknown and defenses unnecessary in ancient civilization
- Am-tep perceived Earth-Goddess overthrown by a being with different values
- Took years for Am-tep to leave the island, accompanied by family on rebuilt ship
- Grandson developed interest in world around him during voyage
- Clear night: stars unchanged from Catastrophe, Moon and Sun undisturbed
- Heavens showed little concern for Daemon's emergence or human rituals
- Am-tep questioned deep forces controlling behavior of world

**Amphos the Craftsman:**
- Descendant of Am-tep for forty generations
- Made living constructing gold jewelry, etc.
- Shared same questions as Am-tep about Catastrophe and natural order
- Studied structure of plants, insects, crystalline rocks, agriculture
- Unsatisfied with explanation of universal order in star patterns
- Believed deeper underlying order in Nature's laws and precision in thinking necessary.

**Amphos' Insight:**
- Seek meaning not in specific patterns but in underlying forces controlling growth
- Order found in the way things behave, not their arrangements
- Precision in uncovering truth through mathematical reasoning and geometry

**Pythagoras:**
- Sage believed in using unchallengeable reason to form precise conclusions
- Mathematics and geometry governed behavior of world, not myth or superstition.

---

## 1. The roots of science 
###  1.1: The quest for the forces that shape the world

**Roots of Science**

**1.1 The quest for forces that shape the world**
- What laws govern our universe? How can we know them? How can this knowledge help us understand and guide the world?
- Early attempts to explain natural phenomena: attributed to human urges (pride, love, ambition, etc.)
- Gradual recognition of mathematical precision in heavenly bodies and earthly behaviors
  - Sun's motion, relationship with seasons, tides
  - Planetary apparent motions revealed underlying precision
- Occult and mystical connotations of astrology
  - Mathematical laws had relevance to Earth, but often misunderstood or exaggerated
- Other regularities in earthly objects: gravity, conservation of mass, rigid spatial motion, Euclidean geometry
  - Implications for everyday life seemed unexciting despite mathematical precision
- Ancient fascination with mathematics led to suppositional associations and occult connotations (astrology, Platonic solids)
- Deeper understanding of relationships between mass, gravity, geometry, planetary motion, behavior of light would come centuries later.

---

### 1.2: Mathematical truth

**Pythagoreans and Mathematical Truth**

**Discovering Mathematical Truth**
- Ancients needed to distinguish true from suppositional in mathematics before understanding Nature
- First major breakthrough in science: laying foundation of mathematical understanding

**Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans**
- Introduced notion of mathematical proof by Thales, but Pythagoreans made significant use
- Recognized importance of number and arithmetical concepts in physics
- Established precise relationship between numbers and geometry with Pythagorean theorem
- Influence on Western music through simple fractional ratios between vibrating strings or pipes
- Sworn to secrecy, many conclusions lost; some leaked out with consequences

**Mathematical Proofs**
- Impeccable argument using logical reasoning to infer the validity of mathematical assertions
- Established as theorem once proven

**Geometrical Theorems vs. Euclidean Geometry**
- Ancients knew only Euclidean geometry, but now we know many other types
- Important to specify which notion of geometry is being referred to when considering geometrical theorems from ancient times
- Euclid's geometry provided excellent approximation to physical world, but not always accurate as shown by Einstein's theories

**Plato and Ideal Forms**
- Recognized mathematical propositions were not about actual physical objects but idealized entities
- Inhabited a different world called Platonic world of mathematical forms.

---

### 1.3: Is Plato’s mathematical world ‘real’?

**The Platonic World: Mathematical Truth and Objectivity**

**Overview:**
- Plato's mathematical world: a significant idea in philosophy with enduring influence on modern science
- Debate over the existence of Platonic world as an absolute reality or mere construct of human minds
- Importance of mathematical precision, reliability, and consistency for scientific theories

**The Case for Objective Mathematical Truth:**
1. **Precision**: requires a mathematical model to be well-defined and consistent
2. **Robustness**: goes beyond individual minds due to its objective external standard
3. **Consensus**: not dependent upon personal opinions or cultural norms
4. **Illustration: Fermat's Last Theorem**
   - Unconfirmed for over 350 years despite efforts by numerous mathematicians
   - Finally proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles
   - Objective mathematical truth assumed, not subjective or dependent on community standards

**Arguments Against Platonic World:**
1. **Alternative viewpoints**: mathematical world as ideas distilled from various minds or agreements among experts
2. **Challenges**: determining the meaning of 'agreed by all' and ensuring external standards without circular reasoning
3. **Robustness of mathematics**: transcends individual capabilities and subjective opinions
4. **Fermat's Last Theorem**: an illustration of objective mathematical truth, not dependent on personal or cultural biases.

---

#### The Mandelbrot Set: Mathematical Objectivity and Eternal Existence.

**The Objectivity of Mathematical Assertions**

**Fermat's Assertion**:
- Wiles' argument may contain errors or be insufficient to prove Fermat's assertion either way
- The issue is the objectivity of the Fermat assertion itself, not the convincingness of any particular demonstration
- The Fermat assertion is a simple mathematical statement whose objective truth is apparent
- Most mathematicians regard such assertions as "obviously true" and not subjective

**The Axiom of Choice**:
- Some mathematical assertions, like the axiom of choice, are more ambiguous in their truth
- Different views on the axiom of choice:
  - **Most mathematicians**: "obviously true"
  - Others: "questionable or false"
  - Some: A matter of opinion, depending on the mathematical system used
- Mathematicians holding the latter view are relatively weak Platonists
- Those accepting objective truth of the axiom are stronger Platonists

**Platonic Existence**:
- Objective mathematical assertions have a Platonic existence in the sense they are objectively true
- Not "mystical" or "unscientific", but rather a matter of objective understanding
- Delicate and technical questions regarding the existence of proposed mathematical entities

**The Mandelbrot Set**:
- Complex, self-similar pattern that cannot be fully comprehended by any human mind
- Defined by simple mathematical rules
- Exists objectively in the Platonic world of mathematical forms, not within human minds or computer representations.

---

### 1.4: Three worlds and three deep mysteries

**Three Worlds and Three Deep Mysteries**

**Three Forms of Existence:**
- Physical world: entities belonging to this world can be perceived through our senses
- Mental world: mental perceptions, thoughts, emotions
- Platonic mathematical world: abstract mathematical concepts and truths

**Connections Between Worlds:**
1. **Mathematical and Physical Worlds**: Only a small part of mathematics has relevance to the physical world
2. **Mental and Physical Worlds**: Mentality arises in association with certain physical structures, especially healthy human brains
3. **Mental and Mathematical Worlds**: Only a small fraction of mental activity is concerned with absolute mathematical truths

**Representation of Worlds:**
- Figure 1.3: three 'worlds' (Platonic mathematical, physical, mental) represented as separate spheres connected at their bases
- Author's beliefs or prejudices about the connections between worlds are indicated in the diagram

**Mathematical Control vs. Personal Motives:**
- Some unease regarding the idea that all actions in the universe are governed by mathematical principles
- Preference for mathematical control over simplistic base motives like pleasure seeking, personal greed, or aggressive violence
- Acknowledgement of limitations in human understanding and the potential existence of physically independent minds

**Prejudices:**
1. All actions in the universe are subject to mathematical laws
2. Mentality has a physical basis
3. Entire Platonic world is within the scope of reason (no mathematical truths beyond human comprehension)

---

#### Exploring the Relationship Between Mathematics and Physical Reality

**The Relationship Between Mathematics and the Physical World (Fig. 1.3 vs Fig. 1.4)**

**Mathematical Statements**:
- Some may lie outside the potential compass of reason, violating the intention behind Fig. 1.3
- The author considers that there might be other mathematical statements beyond the scope of reason
- This will be discussed in greater length in §16.6, relating to Gödel's famous incompleteness theorem

**Fig. 1.4**:
- A redrawing of Fig. 1.3, allowing for three possible violations of the author's prejudices:
  - Physical action beyond the scope of mathematical control
  - Mentality not rooted in physical structures
  - True mathematical assertions inaccessible to reason and insight

**Mysteries in the Author's Preferred Picture (Fig. 1.3)**:
- The remarkable precision with which mathematical laws apply to the world
- The subtle sophistication and mathematical beauty of successful physical theories
- The mystery of how living material can conjure up conscious awareness
- The mystery of perceiving mathematical truth, beyond simple calculation

**The Author's Main Thrust**:
- Exploring the relationship between mathematics and the physical world
- Acquainting readers with mathematical ideas is necessary to appreciate the power of modern science

**Limitations and Controversies**:
- The author does not delve into the second mystery (mentality and conscious awareness) in detail, as it is contentious and could distract from the main focus
- The author believes that understanding mentality requires a deeper physical understanding first

---

### 1.5: The Good, the True, and the Beautiful

**Plato's World of Ideals: The Good, True, and Beautiful**

**Mathematics in Science**
- Crucial role in ancient and modern science
- Emphasizes Truth as absolute ideal (Pythagorean ratios)
  - Diatonic scale: frequencies related by simple ratios
  - Modern piano tuned according to equal temperament scale

**Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans**
- Little known about him or his followers
- Attributions of great importance
- Use 'Pythagorean' as a label, not implying historical accuracy

**The Three Worlds: A Paradox**
- Each world appears to encompass the next
- Possible deeper mystery about the world as a whole
  - Transcends the issue of separating true from false

**Separating True from False**
- Emphasizes importance of mathematics in science
- Addressing the question of good vs. bad (morality) requires understanding of physical circumstances that manifest mentality

**Fermat's Last Theorem and Gödel–Cohen Theorems**
- Fermat's Last Theorem proved by Wiles in 1994
- Independent of standard axioms of set theory
- Doesn't establish whether it will always be settled or not

**Anti-Platonists and Mathematical Statements**
- Believe mathematics is 'all in the mind' but also believe there are true mathematical statements beyond reason.

---

## 2. An ancient theorem and a modern question 
###  2.1: The Pythagorean theorem

**Pythagorean Theorem: Proofs and Assumptions**

**Background:**
- Discussing different types of geometry through Pythagoras' famous theorem
- Two proofs presented: one based on patterns, another assuming Euclidean arguments

**Pythagorean Theorem (Proof 1): Patterns**
1. Statement: Hypotenuse's square equals sum of squares of other two sides in a right-angled triangle
2. Tessellation pattern: covering plane with two sizes of squares without gaps or overlaps
3. Centers of larger squares form vertices of tilted lattice of still larger squares, which cover the entire plane
4. Area of tilted square equals sum of areas of smaller squares
5. Edge length of large tilted square equals hypotenuse of right-angled triangle with sides as lengths of smaller squares
6. Assumptions: repeating pattern of squares is geometrically possible, a square exists
7. Question: What is a square? How do we know it exists?
8. Attempting to construct a square: side lengths and right angles
9. Proving sides are equal and angles are right angles using Euclidean properties
10. Deep issue: proving that squares made up of right angles actually exist

**Pythagorean Theorem (Proof 2): Euclidean Arguments**
- Not covered in provided text, but relies on properties of parallel lines and corresponding angles.

---

### 2.2: Euclid’s postulates

**Euclid's Postulates in Geometry:**

**Background:**
- Euclid's assumptions for geometry: self-evident truths (axioms) vs. less certain postulates
- Five postulates include the parallel postulate
- Euclid's fifth postulate, also known as the parallel postulate or Playfair's axiom

**Euclid's First Four Postulates:**
1. **Uniqueness of straight line segment**: There is only one unique straight line connecting any two points
2. **Extendibility of straight lines**: Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely
3. **Existence of a circle**: For every center and radius, there exists a circle
4. **Equality of right angles**: All right angles are equal
5. **Parallel postulate** (Playfair's axiom): If two lines intersect with an angle less than two right angles on the same side, they will eventually intersect when extended far enough; or: For any point not on a line, there is only one straight line parallel to it in the plane

**Nature of Euclid's Fifth Postulate:**
- Asserts that if lines a and b intersect with angle less than two right angles, they will eventually intersect when extended far enough
- Equivalent form: For any point P not on line a, there is only one line parallel to a through P in the plane.

**Implications of Euclid's Fifth Postulate:**
- Establishing the property for existence of squares with all right angles and equal sides. Without it, we cannot prove that physical squares exist on a cosmological scale in the universe (see §2.7 and §28.10).

---

### 2.3: Similar-areas proof of the Pythagorean theorem

**Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem: Similar Triangles Method**

**Background:**
- Discussing alternative proof of Pythagorean theorem
- Previous section touched on mathematical significance and physical issues related to non-assumption of parallel postulate
- Here, we'll examine another way to prove the Pythagorean theorem using similar triangles

**Proof:**
1. Given: A right-angled triangle subdivided into two smaller triangles by dropping a perpendicular from the right angle onto its hypotenuse (Fig. 2.9)
2. Observation: Area of original triangle = sum of areas of smaller triangles
3. Similarity: All three triangles are similar, possessing same angles and having longest sides as their hypotenuses
4. Property: Areas of similar plane figures proportional to squares of linear dimensions (hypotenuse in this case)
5. Conclusion: Square on hypotenuse of original triangle equals sum of squares on other two sides: Pythagorean theorem

**Assumptions:**
- Sum of angles in any triangle is constant
- Fact that similar figures have areas proportional to squares of their linear dimensions (requires existence of similar figures and definition of area)

**Proof of Sum of Angles in a Triangle:**
1. Extend a side CA and draw AD parallel to CB
2. Since parallel lines, angles EAD and ACB are equal, as well as DAB and CBA
3. Therefore, sum of angles in triangle ABC equals sum of angles in triangles ACB, CBA, BAC (Fig. 2.10)
4. Note: This proof relies on the parallel postulate

**Additional Considerations:**
- Limitations of discussing deeper issues related to numbers used in geometry and their definitions will be addressed later.

---

### 2.4: Hyperbolic geometry: conformal picture

**Hyperbolic Geometry: Conformal Picture**

**Representation of Hyperbolic Geometry in Euclidean Plane:**
- M.C. Escher's woodcut, "Circle Limit I," provides an accurate representation of hyperbolic geometry
- Represents the entire 'universe' of the hyperbolic plane as being squashed into the interior of a circle in an ordinary Euclidean plane
- The bounding circle represents infinity for this hyperbolic universe

**Properties of Hyperbolic Geometry:**
- Parallel postulate is false
- Pythagorean theorem fails to hold
- Angles of a triangle do not add up to π
- For a given size, there is no larger similar shape

**Representation and Terminology:**
- Conformal representation: angles between curves agree with Euclidean measures at their intersection points
- Also referred to as the conformal model or Poincaré disc of hyperbolic plane (with some historical justification discussed in §2.6)

**Sum of Angles in a Hyperbolic Triangle:**
- Sum of angles of a triangle falls short of π by an amount proportional to its area, as discovered by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1728–1777
- Formula: π – (α + β + γ) = CΔ, where ∆ is the area of the triangle and C is a constant
- Scaling can be used to set C = 1

**Distance Between Points:**
- Hyperbolic distance between two points A and B: log(QA/PB), where P and Q are the points where Euclidean circle through A and B orthogonal to bounding circle meets it (Figure 2.13)
- Quantity C –1/2 referred to as pseudo-radius of geometry

**Properties Retained from Euclidean Geometry:**
- Ability to construct various shapes and sizes without changing their hyperbolic shapes or sizes through rigid motion, leading to a notion of congruent figures.

---

### 2.5: Other representations of hyperbolic geometry

**Hyperbolic Geometry Representations**

**Escher's Picture**:
- Escher's picture shows a representation of hyperbolic geometry in Euclidean terms
- This representation, called the conformal model, uses circular arcs to represent straight lines in the hyperbolic plane

**Projective Model**:
- Another representation of hyperbolic geometry is the projective model
- In this model, the entire hyperbolic plane is depicted as the interior of a circle in a Euclidean plane
- Hyperbolic straight lines are represented by straight Euclidean lines rather than circular arcs
- However, the price to pay for this apparent simplification is that hyperbolic angles are not the same as Euclidean angles

**Relating Representations**:
- Beltrami's geometry provides a way of relating the conformal and projective representations
- This involves projecting from the center of the sphere (hemispheric representation) to both the projective plane and the conformal plane (stereographic projection)
- The stereographic projection is conformal, preserving angles, and sends circles on the sphere to circles or straight lines on the plane

**Hyperbolic Squares**:
- In hyperbolic geometry, there are no squares with right angles
- However, there are "squares" with angles less than a right angle
- The size of the square's angle depends on the radius of the circle used in its construction
- A lattice of these hyperbolic squares can be depicted using both the conformal and projective models

---

### 2.6: Historical aspects of hyperbolic geometry

**Historical Aspects of Hyperbolic Geometry**
- Discovered around 300 BC by Girolamo Saccheri in his attempt to prove Euclid's fifth postulate (angle sum of every triangle is less than two right angles) led to a contradiction.
- Failed to find a contradiction, but discovered hyperbolic geometry instead.
- Hyperbolic geometry is different from Euclidean geometry and was named Lobachevskian geometry after Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachei who rediscovered it around 1826.
- Saccheri's method: Proof by contradiction or Reductio ad Absurdum, attempting to prove the fifth postulate false and derive a contradiction.
- Other notable mathematicians who contributed to hyperbolic geometry were Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1728 and Carl Friedrich Gauss around 1800s.
- Lambert derived interesting results from Euclid's fifth postulate being false, including the formula for area of a hyperbolic triangle (π – (α + β + γ) = CΔ).
- Gauss was cautious about publishing his findings on hyperbolic geometry due to potential controversy.
- Hyperbolic geometry is a consistent mathematical structure that exists in Plato's world of forms, different from Euclidean geometry.

#### Hyperbolic Geometry Representations: Beltrami's Models Explained

**Hariot's Formula for Spherical Triangle Area:**
- Formula: Δ = R² (α + β + γ – π)
- Applies to a spherical triangle on a sphere of radius R with angles α, β, γ
- Published by Beltrami in 1868 as part of his work on hyperbolic geometry

**Lambert's Formula for Hyperbolic Triangle:**
- Formula: C = –1/R²
- Applies to a hyperbolic triangle
- Published by Beltrami in 1868 as part of his work on hyperbolic geometry

**Beltrami's Work and Recognition:**
- Eugenio Beltrami discovered various representations of hyperbolic geometry (projective, conformal, pseudo-sphere) in 1868
- His projective representation is sometimes called the 'Klein representation'
- His conformal representation is commonly referred to as the 'Poincaré model', even though Poincaré and Klein later rediscovered it
- Beltrami's work persuaded mathematicians of the consistency of plane hyperbolic geometry due to agreement between measure of hyperbolic distance and Euclidean distance on pseudo-sphere.

**Beltrami's Pseudo-Sphere Model:**
- Represents hyperbolic geometry on a surface called a pseudo-sphere obtained by rotating a tractrix about its asymptote
- Surface has constant negative intrinsic geometry
- Allows local representation of hyperbolic geometry but not the entire geometry at once.

**Problem for Reader:**
- Hint: Use symmetry arguments and total sphere area (4πR²) to prove spherical triangle formula.

---

### 2.7: Relation to physical space

**Hyperbolic Geometry and its Relation to Physical Space**

**Conformal Model for Three-Dimensional Hyperbolic Geometry:**
- Represented by the interior of a finite Euclidean sphere instead of a bounding circle
- Straight lines are Euclidean circles orthogonal to the boundary sphere
- Angles and distances follow the same formula as in two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry

**Projective Model for Three-Dimensional Hyperbolic Geometry:**
- Euclidean straight lines represent hyperbolic straight lines
- Distances given by the same formula as in two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry

**Comparison to Our Universe:**
- Einstein's general relativity shows that Euclidian geometry is an approximation to actual physical space
- Observational evidence suggests that large-scale spatial geometry of the universe is close to uniform (homogeneous and isotropic) Euclidean geometry
  * However, controversy remains over whether hyperbolic or elliptic geometry might also apply
  * Evidence points to both possibilities: some supporting Euclidean, others hyperbolic or elliptic geometry

**Role of Hyperbolic Geometry in Modern Physics:**
- Three-dimensional hyperbolic space is fundamental to modern understanding of physical universe
  * Space of velocities in special relativity
- Pythagorean theorem holds in the limit of small distances for all 'Riemannian' geometries, including hyperbolic and irregularly curved ones.

#### Geometry and Mathematical Concepts in History, including Pythagorean Theorem, Intuitionism, and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Analysis.

**Section 2.1: Pythagorean Theorem**
- Historical origins unclear, attributed to Pythagoras and his followers but with ancient Egyptians and Babylonians also knowing it
- First proofs in Euclid's work contained hidden assumptions about topological issues that were pointed out later by Hilbert

**Section 2.2: Notations and Extensions**
- Exponent notation (e.g., C –1/2) represents multiple products of a number with itself
- Extends to negative exponents, where reciprocals are denoted as 1/a or a^(-n), and roots and powers use similar notation

**Section 2.3: Intuitionism and Proof by Contradiction**
- Some mathematicians object to the principle of "proof by contradiction" on the grounds that it can be non-constructive in leading to unprovided existential assertions

**Section 2.4: Curvature and Euclidean Geometry**
- Great circle arcs are shortest curves (geodesics) on a sphere's surface
- Gauss may have sought deviations from Euclidean geometry in physical space, although this is disputed by some scholars

**Section 2.5: Poincaré Half-Plane Representation and Riemann's Constant Negative Curvature**
- Beltrami discovered the "Poincaré half-plane" representation and the constant negative curvature of its metric
- Gauss was aware of geodesy but it is unclear if he sought deviations from Euclidean geometry in space

**Section 2.6: Gauss–Bonnet Theorem**
- A topological theorem named after Gauss and Bonnet, although Blaschke and Olinde Rodrigues discovered the result and elegant proof procedure

**Section 2.7: Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) Evidence for Overall Universe Structure**
- Detailed analysis of CMB provides evidence for overall structure of the universe, as discussed in §§27.7,10,11,28.5,10,30.14

## 3. Kinds of number in the physical world 
###  3.1: A Pythagorean catastrophe?

**Pythagorean Theorem and Rational Numbers**

**Background**
- Discovery that there is no rational number whose square equals 2
- Pythagoreans initially tried to express all geometry in terms of rational numbers

**Problem with Rational Numbers**
1. Attempted proof by contradiction
2. Assumption: a^2 = 2b^2
3. Contradiction: a^2 > b^2 > 0, leading to an infinite sequence of inequalities
4. Conclusion: no rational number squares to 2

**Significance of the Result**
- Difficulty for Pythagoreans as irrational numbers require infinite processes
- First proof by contradiction in classical mathematics

**Properties Used in Argument**
1. Square of an odd integer is odd
2. If an integer is not odd, it is even
3. Every strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers must come to an end

**Extensions and Alternative Entities**
- Applications to other kinds of entities with the same assumptions
- Real numbers and their square roots
- Failure of argument for real numbers or fractions due to non-ending sequences

**Real Numbers vs. Rationals**
- Need for studying real numbers as they have decimal expansions unlike rationals

*1 The conclusion that a^2 > b^2 was derived from the equation a^2 = 2b^2 by dividing both sides by 2.*
*2 This proof is called the "proof by contradiction" or the "proof of the impossibility of a square root of 2." It has been attributed to various mathematicians throughout history, including Diophantus and Archimedes, although it may not have been formulated as we know it today until around the late 16th century.*
*3 This sequence is known as the "Cantor's diagonal argument" and was first introduced by Georg Cantor in 1891 to prove that there are uncountably many real numbers. It demonstrates that not every real number can be written as a terminating or repeating decimal, unlike rational numbers. The sequence given here is an example of such a non-terminating sequence.*

### 3.2: The real-number system

**The Real Number System**

**Greeks' Realization**:
- Rational numbers are not enough for developing Euclidean geometry ideas
- The need for **real numbers** is now familiar, despite calculators only expressing numbers in finite digits

**Real Numbers vs. Rationals**:
- Decimal expansions were unavailable to the ancient Greeks
- They adopted a system of representing numbers using **continued fractions**

**Continued Fractions**:
- A continued fraction is an expression: `a + (b + (c + (d + ...)–1)–1)` where `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`,... are positive integers
- Rational numbers can be written as terminating or infinite continued fractions
- Real numbers (non-rationals) have an infinite continued fraction representation
- The sequence of natural numbers in the continued fraction has a **periodic property**

**Quadratic Irrationals**:
- Numbers like `√2`, `√3`, `√5` are quadratic irrationals
- They are important for Euclidean geometry as they arise from ruler-and-compass constructions
- Quadratic irrational numbers can be represented by a **palindromic sequence** of natural numbers repeating indefinitely

**Continued Fractions vs. Decimal Notation**:
- Rational numbers have ultimately periodic expressions in decimal notation
- Continued fractions are particularly striking for quadratic irrationals
- Lagrange's theorem states that the continued fraction representation of a real number is ultimately periodic if and only if it is a quadratic irrational

**Limitations of Known Greek Knowledge**:
- It seems likely the Greeks knew much about continued fractions, including Lagrange's theorem
- Plato's contemporary Theaetetus established much of this knowledge, with some evidence in Plato's dialectics
- However, numbers like `√3 + 1` were not known to be quadratic irrationals at that time

#### Greek Methods for Real Number Representations in Geometry

**Eudoxos's Contribution to Greek Mathematics**

**Background:**
- Eudoxos, a student of Plato, developed essential ideas for real numbers in ancient Greece around 4th century BC
- His work provided a criterion for comparing length ratios (a : b vs. c : d) and abstract concept of real numbers
- Greeks viewed space as an abstract entity, trying to understand real numbers through it

**Eudoxos's Theory:**
1. **Length Ratios**: Expressed in terms of ratios instead of direct length measurements
2. **Equality of Ratios**: Criterion for when a ratio a : b is greater or less than c : d
3. **Real Numbers**: Abstract concept of numbers based on these criteria
4. **Rules**: Sum and product of real numbers were provided
5. **Difference in Viewpoint**: Greeks saw numbers as inherent to space, while modern mathematicians separate them
6. **Eudoxos vs. Modern Approach**: Eudoxos extracted ideal notion of real numbers from Euclidean geometry; modern approach separates mathematical notion of number from physical space
7. **Challenges in Understanding:** Determining nature of 'Platonic physical geometry' and measuring at tiny or large distances remain difficult questions even today
8. **Dedekind and Cantor's Contributions**: Developed ideas of real numbers without direct reference to geometry using infinite sets of rational numbers (Dedekind cuts)
9. **Laws and Limits**: Enabled understanding and application in various mathematical notions.

**Tasks:**
- Experiment with calculator to obtain expansions of π
- Show that continued fractions represent specific quantities through quadratic equations.

### 3.3: Real numbers in the physical world

**Real Numbers in the Physical World**

**Profound Issue**:
- Development of mathematical ideas driven by finding structures to mirror the physical world's behavior
- Examining physical world in precise detail is not possible to abstract clear-cut mathematical notions
- Mathematical ideas develop and problems arise, leading to extensions of original concepts
- Extensions may seem forced or based on convenience, consistency, or elegance

**Real Number System**:
- No direct evidence from Nature that there is a physical notion of 'distance' that extends to large scales
- No evidence for the existence of points in space using Euclidean geometry
- Real number system was driven by mathematical consistency and elegance
- Successful broad-ranging physical theories have adopted the real number system

**Rationale for Adopting Real Numbers**:
- Measures like area, volume, and time also require real numbers
- Spacetime volumes are four-dimensional, requiring consideration of temporal range
- Calculus is a crucial framework for dynamical theories in physics

**Questions Remain**:
- Whether the real number system is 'correct' for describing physical reality at its deepest levels
- The infinitesimal nature of the reals is required in calculus formulations

#### Discussion on Discreteness in Quantum Mechanics and Space-Time.

**Discreteness in Physical World Debate:**

**Early 20th Century**
- Quantum mechanics introduced, revealed discrete nature of energy (quanta) and physical quantities like action and spin
- Some physicists proposed a discrete picture of the world based on these discoveries

**Understanding of Quantum Mechanics Today**
- Does not force or imply a granular nature to space, time, or energy at smallest scales
- Discrete processes may still be necessary for some fundamental changes in Nature (Schrödinger's proposal)

**Einstein and Schrödinger's Views on Discreteness**
- Einstein suggested a purely algebraic theory as future physics might require
- Both believed fundamental discreteness could be the answer despite quantum mechanics not implying it

**Attempts to Build Combinatorial Approaches**
- Some physicists pursued ideas of discretely based theories, like spin networks (Penrose's proposal)
- These ideas have been further developed and integrated into some programs for tackling quantum gravity

**Role of Real Numbers in Modern Physics**
- Still plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the physical world as we know it today.

---

### 3.4: Do natural numbers need the physical world?

**Natural Numbers and Physical World**

**Background:**
- Dedekind approach to real number system presupposes understanding of rational numbers, which are ratios of integers
- Discrete approaches in physics depend on natural numbers (counting numbers) and their extension to integers

**Natural Numbers as Elementary Counting Numbers:**
- Natural numbers: non-negative whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Role is clear and unambiguous
- Subject to operations of addition and multiplication

**Existence of Natural Numbers:**
- Depends on persistent distinguishable objects in the universe for counting
- Questionable in a universe where number of objects keeps changing or contains only finite items
- Notion of natural number might be irrelevant for some universes

**Introduction to Natural Numbers through Set Theory:**
- Abstract concept introduced using the notion of set
- Empty set (Ø) associated with 0, containing no members
- Set whose only member is Ø associated with 1, having one member
- Sequence of sets created, each containing the previous sets, leading to infinite sequence of abstract mathematical entities for natural numbers.

---

### 3.5: Discrete numbers in the physical world

**Rational Numbers and Integers**
- Dedekind's construction used sets of rational numbers, not natural numbers directly
- Rational number definition: once natural numbers are understood
- Intermediate step: defining integers
- Natural number or negative of a natural number (including zero)
- Mathematical definition of 'negative': attach sign '–' to each natural number except 0
- Arithmetic rules consistent, but no physical meaning for negative numbers
- Negative integers have organizational value, e.g., bank balances

**Physical Relevance of Negative Numbers**
- Direct relevance: scalar quantities without directional aspect
- First example: electric charge
  * Protons have three quarks with charges +1, +2/3, -2/3
  * Electric charge quantified in terms of integers (multiples of proton charge)
- Additive quantum numbers
  * Characterize particles of Nature
  * Quantified as integer multiples of a basic unit
- All known additive quantum numbers are integers
- Negative values do occur in 20th-century physics

**Qualification on Antiparticles and Masses**
- An antiproton is not 'minus one proton' but has the same mass as an ordinary proton (positive)
- Virtual particles have negative energy, but do not have independent existence as actual particles.

---

#### The passage discusses historical uses of various mathematical concepts in physics, including rational, real, complex, and quadratic irrational numbers.

**The Rational Numbers and Their Role in Physics**

**Rational Numbers**:
- Not found to play a direct role in the physical universe, as far as conventional theory is concerned
- Play a part in certain physical curiosities, but their relevance is unclear
- May play a fundamental role in quantum mechanics, representing choices between finite possibilities

**Complex Numbers**:
- First encountered in the 16th century, initially treated with distrust
- Gradually became an indispensable ingredient of mathematical thinking
- Also play an extraordinary and basic role in the operation of the physical universe at its tiniest scales

**Continued Fractions**:
- A representation of real numbers as an infinite sequence of integers, often used to find the lowest-term form of a fraction
- Provide a deeper and more interesting understanding than decimal expansions for certain mathematical applications
- However, are not well-suited for practical calculation

**Quadratic Irrationals**:
- Solutions to quadratic equations with non-zero coefficients
- In the absence of rational solutions, the solutions are indeed quadratic irrationals

**The Place of Numbers in Ancient Greek Thought**:
- Euclid's algorithm led to continued fraction expressions for ratios of geometrical lengths
- Quadratic irrationals were used in ancient Greek thinking on the nature of space

**Scientific Notation and Numerical Scales**:
- The scientific notation '10^12' is clearer than verbal terms like 'million million'
- Negative exponents are also used for fractions of 1/1,000,000, etc.

**Ordinal Numbers and Constructs**:
- Ordinal numbers extend to infinite ordinals
- The notion of a 'construct' should not be taken in too strong a sense, as there are real numbers inaccessible by any computational procedure

**The Discovery of Fundamental Physical Constants**:
- George Johnstone Stoney first estimated the basic electric charge in 1874 and coined the term 'electron' in 1891
- Robert Andrews Millikan precisely measured the electron charge using the oil-drop experiment in 1909
- The proton-to-electron charge discrepancy proposed by Lyttleton and Bondi in 1959 was disproved, but provided an example of creative thinking

**Additive vs. Multiplicative Quantum Numbers**:
- Additive quantum numbers, like angular momentum, are distinguished from multiplicative ones, like electric charge

## 4. Magical complex numbers 
###  4.1: The magic number ‘i’

**Magical Complex Numbers: The Imaginary Number 'i'**
- In mathematics, the square of a positive or non-zero number is always positive. However, there exists no real number that satisfies the equation x² = –1.
- To resolve this issue, mathematicians introduced the **imaginary unit 'i'**, which has the property i² = –1. Complex numbers are formed by combining real numbers (a and b) with imaginary units (i).
- The rules of addition, subtraction, and multiplication for complex numbers follow the same principles as for real numbers:
  - **Addition**: (a + ib) + (c + id) = (a + c) + i(b + d)
  - **Subtraction**: (a + ib) – (c + id) = (a – c) + i(b – d)
  - **Multiplication**: (a + ib)(c + id) = ac – bd^2 + i(bc + ad)
- Division of complex numbers by non-zero complex numbers is possible, but more complicated than addition and multiplication. The division rule involves the modulus (magnitude), argument (angle), and conjugate of a complex number z = a + ib:
  - **Division**: z/w = (ac + bd)/(c² + d²) + i[(bc – ad)/(c² + d²)]
- Complex numbers are often thought of as single entities, denoted by the letter z or w, rather than pairs of real numbers a and b.
- All normal algebraic rules apply to complex numbers, and they can be visualized on the **complex plane**.

---

### 4.2: Solving equations with complex numbers

**Complex Numbers and Equation Solving**

**Introduction to Complex Roots**
- Complex numbers have square roots, including negative numbers like -2
- For any real number a, i^2 = a for both i and -i
- Every complex number has a unique set of square roots (positive and negative)

**Higher Roots**
- Cube roots, fifth roots, and other roots can be found for any complex number except 0
- There are multiple solutions due to the nature of complex numbers

**The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**
- Any polynomial equation has complex solutions (real or imaginary)
- This was discovered through the study of logarithms in Chapter 5
- Includes equations with positive integer coefficients and any positive n value

**Cardano's Problem: Solving Real Cubic Equations**
- Cardano aimed to find an expression for the general solution of a real cubic equation (n = 3)
- Reduced the problem to x³ = 3px + 2q, where p and q are real numbers
- Solutions depend on whether q² > p³ or not:
  - If yes: One real solution given by the formula
  - If no (irreducible case): Three real solutions involving complex numbers

**Complex Solutions in the Irreducible Case**
- Bombelli later showed that allowing complex numbers enables finding all three real solutions
- This seems contradictory, as only real coefficients and solutions are involved
- However, this complex journey is necessary to obtain the final real-number answers.

### 4.3: Convergence of power series

**Power Series Convergence**

**Power series**: Infinite sum of the form:
a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + a₃x³ + ...

**Divergent series**: Does not settle down to a particular finite value as more terms are added.
- Example: 1 + x² + x⁴ + x⁶ + ... (for x = 1 or x = 2)
  * When x = 1 or x = 2, the terms get bigger and diverge
- Reason for divergence: The individual terms become larger as x increases

**Convergent series**: Converges to a limiting value
- Example: 1 + x² -> (1 - x²)⁻¹ for x < 1

**Understanding Divergence vs. Convergence**:
- Series converges if the terms get arbitrarily close to a limit
- A series diverges when it does not approach any finite value

**Convergence of Power Series**:
- For some power series, the sum of the terms cannot be reached directly (like x² = –1)
  * The answer is not simply obtained by adding up the terms
- Convergent series can still be understood through an explicit formula like (1 - x²)⁻¹

**Importance of Understanding Divergence**:
- Divergent series are encountered in modern physics, particularly quantum field theory
- Understanding why a series diverges provides valuable insights into underlying mathematical structures.

#### Exploring Convergence of Complex Series and Functional Behavior.

**Issues with Deciding Meaning and Correctness of Answers in Series Expansions**

**Delicate issues:**
- Determining meaningful answers from manipulating divergent expressions
- Accurate answers can be obtained, but not always
- Relevant for current physical theories and assessing them

**Complex Numbers and Convergence of Series**
- Considering function (1 + x²)-1 instead of previous one
- Better chance of complete convergence due to finite range
- Power series expansion: 1 – x² + x⁴ – x⁶ + ... = (1 + x²)-1
- Partial sums converge between -1 and +1, diverge outside this range
- Convergence for |x| < 1, divergence for |x| > 1 despite the function being well-behaved at ±1.

**Partial Sums' Behavior:**
- Failure to settle down on answer in some cases
- Partial sums 'take off' or flap wildly up and down at x = ±1

**Resolution of Mystery:**
- Examining complex values of the function instead of real ones reveals the discrepancy between actually summing series and passing directly to supposed infinite sum answer.

### 4.4: Caspar Wessel’s complex plane

**Caspar Wessel's Complex Plane**

**Background:**
- Caspar Wessel and others independently introduced the complex plane in 1797, providing geometrical interpretations of complex number operations
- Represented as points (x, y) in Euclidean plane with x axis as real line and y axis as imaginary axis

**Complex Variable z:**
- Extends functions from real variable x to complex variable z = x + iy
- Functions: (1 – z^2)^−1 and (1 + z^2)^−1

**Singularities:**
- Singularities in the complex plane indicate where the series converges or diverges
- Circle of Convergence
  * Location of points where the power series converges if z lies inside it
  * Diverges if z is outside it
  * Convergence on circle's edge is a delicate issue

**Singularities for Given Function:**
- Find the largest circle centered at origin that does not contain any singularity in its interior

**Example: Functions (1 – z^2)^−1 and (1 + z^2)^−1**
- Singularities are poles, located at unit distance from origin
  * For both functions, the circle of convergence is the unit circle about origin
  * Points where the circle meets real axis: ±1

**Insights:**
- Complex numbers provide deeper insights into power series behavior than considering their real variable structure.

### 4.5: How to construct the Mandelbrot set

**The Mandelbrot Set**

**Construction of the Mandelbrot Set**:
- Examine repeated applications of the transformation:
  ```z = z² + c```
- Iterate this transformation and observe how the point `z` wanders in the complex plane:
  - If `z` wanders off to infinity, the point `c` is colored white.
  - If `z` wanders around without receding to infinity, the point `c` is colored black.
- The black region gives the Mandelbrot set.

**Behavior of Iteration**:
- For any given value of `c`, one of two things can happen:
  - The sequence becomes unbounded (the points recede to infinity).
  - The sequence remains bounded within a fixed distance from the origin (the Mandelbrot set).

**Complexity of the Mandelbrot Set**:
- The white regions are locations of `c` that give an unbounded sequence.
- The black regions are the bounded cases, the Mandelbrot set itself.
- The complication arises from the many ways the iterated sequence can remain bounded (cycles, 'almost' cycles).

**Relationship to Complex Analysis**:
- The fundamental theorem of algebra states that any complex polynomial factors into linear terms.
- Tartaglia and Cardano had a dispute over priority in solving this equation.

## 5. Geometry of logarithms, powers, and roots 
###  5.1: Geometry of complex algebra

**Complex Algebra in Geometry:**
* Rules for addition and multiplication of complex numbers represented geometrically
	+ Parallelogram law: points representing w + z determined by a parallelogram's vertices (0, w, w + z, z)
		- No reflection involved, line segment from w to w + z parallel to that from 0 to z
	+ Similar-triangle law: triangles with vertices at 0, 1, w and 0, z, wz are similar
		- Multiplication map leaves origin fixed while preserving shapes through a rotation and expansion or contraction
* Translation vs. multiplication maps: addition slides the complex plane, multiplication rotates and expands/contracts it
* Another way of looking at these transformations without detailed computation
* Polar coordinates (r, θ): distance r from origin and angle θ with real axis
	+ Modulus r = |z| is the distance from origin; argument θ is angle between z and real axis
	+ Ambiguity in θ: allowing winding around origin with integer multiples of 2π
* Trigonometric relationships between Cartesian and polar forms of complex numbers
	+ x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ; inversely, θ = tan–1(y/x)
	+ Tan–1 function has ambiguity allowing addition of integer multiples of 2π to θ.

---

### 5.2: The idea of the complex logarithm

**The Idea of the Complex Logarithm**

**Similar-Triangle Law for Multiplication of Complex Numbers**:
- When multiplying two complex numbers, we add their arguments and multiply their moduli
- This fact is the basis of logarithms (logarithm of product equals sum of logarithms)
- Illustrated in Figure 5.1b and slide rule

**Logarithms**:
- Logarithm is the reverse of raising a number to a power or exponentiation
- The formula: b^m × n = b^(m+n) holds for positive integers
- We need to generalize this formula for complex numbers

**Generalizing Exponentiation to Complex Numbers**:
- Initially, "b raised to the power z" is understood as b multiplied together for positive integers
- Allowing zero: defining b^0 = 1
- Allowing negative exponents: defining b^-1 as the reciprocal and b^(-n) as nth power of the reciprocal
- Generalizing to fractional exponents (m/n): repeated multiplication leads us to the concept of an nth root of b
- Extending to real numbers: defining b^z uniquely for rational z = m/n and then for any real number z
- Hitting a snag when b is negative, requiring the introduction of i to enter the complex world

**Defining Complex Logarithms**:
- Require a definition of "bp" such that: bp + q = bp × bq
- Define log base b(z) as the inverse function of f(z) = b^z
- Expect log base b(p×q) = log base b(p) + log base b(q) to hold, converting multiplication into addition.

---

### 5.3: Multiple valuedness, natural logarithms

**Multiple Valuedness of Complex Logarithms**

**Complex Numbers**:
- Complex numbers have both real and imaginary parts
- The argument of a complex number (θ) is ambiguous, with multiple solutions
- This ambiguity can be expressed as the logarithm being ambiguous up to an integer multiple of 2πi

**Natural Logarithms**:
- Natural logarithms are the inverse function of the exponential function e^z
- The real part of z = log w is just the ordinary real logarithm
- The imaginary part of z = θ is the argument of the complex number w (θ)
- This leads to ambiguous solutions for a given w, with logarithms differing by integer multiples of 2πi

**Multiplication-to-Addition Property**:
- The product of two complex numbers is equivalent to multiplying their moduli and adding their arguments
- This property can be seen in the formula e^(θ + φ) = r * e^(i(θ + φ)) = re^(i(θ + φ))

**Cotes–Euler Formula**:
- The Cotes–Euler formula relates complex exponential functions to trigonometry
- It encapsulates the essentials of trigonometric functions in a much simpler way using complex exponential functions

**Expanding Complex Logarithmic Expressions**:
- Expanding expressions like e^(a + b) and e^3iθ leads to more complicated real-valued formulae, but these can be derived from the simple complex expressions.

---

### 5.4: Complex powers

**Complex Powers**

**Wz Definition**:
- wz = e^(z * log(w))
- Logarithm is ambiguous, so any integer multiple of 2πi can be added to log w
- This results in different allowable 'wz' values

**Ambiguity and Problems**:
- Ambiguity leads to problems if not handled carefully
- Best approach: use notation wz only with a specified log w
- For e^z, the convention is always take log(e) = 1

**Other Logarithmic Functions**:
- Need specification of log b to define 'logarithm base b' function
- Logb w will still be many-valued (add integer multiple of 2πi/log b)

**Curiosity: II**:
- II = e^(ii)
- Specified log i = πi, but there are other allowable values by multiplying by e^(2πn)
- All values of ii are real numbers

**Wz 1/2 Calculation**:
- Represented as intersections of two equiangular spirals in the complex plane
- Generating all n solutions of w^(1/n) involves successively different log w values

**Roots of a Complex Number**:
- Express zth root as w^(1/z)
- Depending on choice of log w, we get infinite values for w^(1/z)
- With the right specified choice (log w/(z)), we get w
- For positive integer z, we get n roots; the nth roots of unity are vertices of a regular n-gon
- The nth roots of unity form a cyclic group Zn

**Multiplication and Division**:
- Multiplication: wa * b -> wasb
- Division: w/a = 1/(wa)
- In the case of regular n-gon, multiplication by ω rotates triangle clockwise or counterclockwise depending on direction.

---

### 5.5: Some relations to modern particle physics

**Complex Numbers and Modern Particle Physics**

**Multiplicative Quantum Numbers in Modern Particle Physics**
- Some interest in modern particle physics due to numbers such as these providing possible cases of multiplicative quantum numbers.
- Additive (scalar) quantum numbers are quantified by integers, while few examples of multiplicative quantum numbers exist.
- These multiplicative quantum numbers seem to be quantified in terms of nth roots of unity.

**Parity as an Approximate Multiplicative Quantum Number**
- Parity is an (approximate) multiplicative quantum number with **n = 2**.
- Notion of parity for a composite system built up from its basic constituent particles.
- For a constituent particle, its parity can be even or odd, corresponding to mirror reflection being the same as or different from its antiparticle.
- Parity is not a conserved quantity with respect to weak interactions and may not have a well-defined value for certain particles.
- Applies only to bosons; distinction between fermions and bosons described below.

**Multiplicative Quantum Number Relating to Fermion/Boson Nature**
- Another multiplicative quantum number with **n = 4**, combining parity notion for fermions and their fermion/boson nature.
- For a fermion, the parity value is ±i or their double mirror reflections; for a boson, it remains ±1 as before.

**Quarkiness as a Multiplicative Quantum Number**
- **Quarkiness**: multiplicative quantum number related to electric charge of quarks (not a standard terminology).
- Quarks cannot exist separately unless their combined charges add up to an integer multiple of the electron's charge.
- Values for quarkiness are 1, **ω**, and **ω2**; for an antiquark, it is –**ω** or **ω2**.
- Degrees of quarkiness constitute the cyclic group **ℤ3**.

**Introduction to Calculus and Its Magic in Understanding Complex Numbers**
- Calculus essential for understanding physics.
- Some mathematical aspects of complex numbers introduced, with hints at more striking applications given later.
- Fascinating aspects of complex number magic described: natural logarithm formula and Euler's **eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ**.

## 6. Real-number calculus 
###  6.1: What makes an honest function?

**Mathematical Analysis: Calculus and Functions**

**Calculus:**
- Built from differentiation and integration
- Differential calculus: local quantities, velocities, slopes, curvature
- Integral calculus: areas, volumes, totality
- Inverse of each other (fundamental theorem)

**Function:**
- Modern definition: mapping from domain A to target B
- Assigns a value in the target for every element in the domain
- Doesn't require an explicit formula or formulaic expression

**Examples of Functions:**
1. x²
2. |x|
3. θ(x) (Heaviside step function)

**Euler's Perspective vs Modern Definition:**
- Euler: functions were explicit formulas, e.g., x² or sin(x)
- Modern definition: mappings from domain to target array

**Issues with Non-explicit Functions:**
- Not 'smooth' or not having a well-defined slope at specific points may cause issues
- |x| and θ(x) are valid functions in modern sense but would give Euler difficulty.

---

### 6.2: Slopes of functions

**Slopes and Differentiability of Functions**
* The differential calculus is concerned with finding 'slopes' of functions
* |x| function has no unique slope at the origin due to its non-differentiiability there
* x² function has a well-defined slope everywhere and is differentiable
* θ(x) function takes an unpleasant jump (discontinuity) at the origin
* Continuity vs. differentiability: continuity is interconnected with smoothness, but not identical concepts
* x³ and x|x| functions look 'smooth' but are not 'nice' functions due to their lack of well-defined curvature or twice differentiability at the origin

**Measuring Slopes (Derivative)**
* Slope is measured as dy/dx, where:
  * dy = tiny increase in y value along curve
  * dx = corresponding tiny increase in x value
* Derivative function f'(x) plots the slope at each point p for a given function f(x)

---

### 6.3: Higher derivatives

**The Second Derivative of Functions**

**The Second Derivative**:
- The second derivative is the slope of the first derivative, which provides information about the curvature of a function.
- It is commonly written as **f″(x)** and gives the rate at which the first derivative changes with respect to x.
- The second derivative of y with respect to x is written as **d2y/dx²**.

**Points of Interest**:
- Horizontal slope points: Where f'(x) meets the x-axis, indicating where dy/dx vanishes.
- Maximum or minimum points: These occur at locations where the second derivative (inflection point) meets the x-axis.
- Continuity and Smoothness: Functions like **x³** and its derivatives are continuous and smooth, while functions like **x|x|** exhibit discontinuities in higher derivatives.
- C∞-smoothness: A function that can be differentiated an arbitrary number of times at each point is considered C∞-smooth.

**Euler's Perspective**:
- Euler may have expected his functions to be C∞-smooth, but not necessarily at every point in the domain.
- Functions like **1/x** and step functions are not C∞-smooth according to modern definitions but were still acceptable to Euler.
- Euler's notion of a function might have been more flexible than modern definitions, allowing for 'glitches' or discontinuities at certain points.

---

### 6.4: The ‘Eulerian’ notion of a function?

**The Eulerian Notion of Function**

**Two Approaches to Resolving the Issue**:
- One uses complex numbers, requiring a function f(z) to be differentiable with respect to the complex variable z, making it a kind of C∞-function.
- The other approach uses real numbers and involves power series expansions, which were first encountered in §2.5.

**Power Series Expansions**:
- If a function f(x) has a power series representation: f(x) = ∑a_n x^n
- To find the coefficients a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., the function must be C∞-smooth.

**Converse of Power Series Expansion**:
- If the a_i are given, does it follow that the sum actually gives f(x) in some interval?
- In the case of the example h(x), the power series expansion has all coefficients vanishing for x < 0 and e^(-1/x), indicating a flaw at the join at x = 0.

**Analytic Functions**:
- A function f(x) is **analytic at a point p** if it can be expressed as a power series expansion about that point in some interval.
- If a function is analytic at all points of its domain, it is called an **analytic function** or a **Cω-smooth function**.
- Analytic functions are "smoother" than C∞-smooth functions and cannot be glued together like some examples given (e.g., θ(x), |x|, x^n).

**Complex Approach**:
- The complex approach gives a greater depth of understanding, as it shows that certain non-analytic functions are still "one function".

---

### 6.5: The rules of differentiation

**The Rules of Differentiation in Differential Calculus**

**Power Series Derivatives**:
- The derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1)
- This can be expressed as d(x^n)/dx = nx^(n-1)

**Rules for Sums**:
- The derivative of a sum (f+g) is the sum of their derivatives: df/dx + dg/dx
- This extends to a sum of any finite number of functions

**Constants and Differentiating Power Series**:
- The derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of that function
- For example, if a is a constant, then d(ax^n) = anx^(n-1)
- This can also be expressed as d[f(x)]/dx = f'(x), where f(x) = ax^n

**The Leibniz Law**:
- Differentiating a product of two functions (fg) is given by the Leibniz law: d(fg)/dx = f'g + fg'
- This can be used to derive the rule for power series derivatives

**Differentiation as an Explicit Computational Procedure**:
- Differentiating complex expressions involves applying the rules of calculus, which can be readily implemented on a computer
- However, going in the reverse direction (finding an antiderivative) is much more difficult

---

### 6.6: Integration

**Integration: Reversing Differentiation**
- Integration is the reverse of differentiation
- Instead of finding a derivative, we want to find an antiderivative `g(x)` such that `g'(x) = f(x)`
- This can be thought of as moving upwards from a bottom curve in Fig. 6.8 or Fig. 6.9

**Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:**
- If `f(x)` is the derivative of `g(x)`, then the area under the curve `y = f(x)` between two x-values `a` and `b` can be calculated as `g(b) - g(a)` (signs taken into account).
- This is because the top curve in Fig. 6.8 or Fig. 6.9 maps out the areas beneath the bottom curve by plotting the slopes of that curve.

**Sign Considerations:**
- The area under a curve dips below the x-axis, so negative regions are also considered when calculating total area.
- Signs are reversed if `a > b` instead of `a < b`.

**Area Calculation with Narrow Strips:**
- For very narrow strips between adjacent x-values `a` and `b`, the strip's area is essentially the product of its width (`b - a`) and height (slope of top curve).
- This difference in heights is equivalent to the difference in values `g(b) - g(a)`.
- Broad strips are built up from many narrow ones, so integrating over an entire interval measures how much the top curve rises.

**Indefinite Integrals:**
- A function `g(x)` or its constant sum `g(x) + C` that differentiates to `f(x)` is called an indefinite integral of `f(x)`.
- The symbol `∫` represents the inverse of the 'd' symbol used for differentiation.

**Definite Integrals:**
- To calculate a specific area between two x-values, use the definite integral notation `∫[a, b] f(x) dx`.

**Integrating Functions:**
- Integrating general functions is not as straightforward as differentiation.
- Many tricks are known to integrate specific cases, but they do not suffice for all functions.
- New functions may need to be 'invented' to express the results of integration.

**Example: Integrating Power Functions:**
- For a general power function `x^n`, we can integrate it to obtain `(x^(n+1))/(n+1)`.
- However, this does not work for the case `n = -1` (logarithmic function).
- We must use other formulas like `d(log x) = x^-1 dx` to handle such cases.

#### Differentiating vs Integrating: Sensitivity of Differentiation and Definition of Delta Function

**Difficulty in Explicit Integration vs. Existence of Functions**
- Difficulty arises when no previously known function can be used to express answer
- Integrals often provide means for defining new functions
- **Explicit integration**: concerned with obtaining explicit expressions
- If not interested in explicit expressions, existence of functions is more easily determined through integration
- Numerical data: problem with differentiation lies in its sensitivity to fine details of function to be differentiated
- Integration relatively insensitive and can integrate any continuous (C0) function on a closed interval
- Differentiation makes things worse, may end at non-differentiable point
- Approaches enable process of differentiation to continue infinitely: delta function, complex numbers

**Notes:**
* Abuse of notation in Section 6.1
* Euler's views on functions: hypothetical idealized individual, not direct information about real Leonhard Euler's views
* Maclaurin series and power series expansion (Section 6.4)
* Technical subtlety when applying law to infinite terms of a power series (Note 6.10)
* sin–1, cos–1, tan–1: inverse functions of sin, cos, and tan; select values within their defined ranges
* Compact domain requirement for integration (Section 6.6)
* Oliver Heaviside also conceived the delta function before Dirac.

## 7. Complex-number calculus 
###  7.1: Complex smoothness

**Complex-number calculus**

**7.1 Complex smoothness; holomorphic functions**
- **Understanding complex differentiation**: Not addressed in detail, but gist conveyed through a rapid outline of essential argument
- **Requirements for complex differentiability**:
  - Necessary to have a notion of 'slope' of the complex curve `w = f(z)` at any point `z`
  - As we move `z` around slightly in different directions, `f(z)` must satisfy Cauchy-Riemann equations
    - Involve derivatives of real and imaginary parts of `f(z)`, with respect to real and imaginary parts of `z`
- **Surprising ingredients of complex integration**: Enables new notion of contour integration
- **Derivative formula for complex functions**
  - Once we have the first derivative, we get all higher derivatives free
  - Formula used to provide Taylor series expression for `f(z)`, which converges inside certain circle in complex plane
- **Magical fact about complex smoothness**: Complex-smooth functions are necessarily analytic
- **Limitation of 'Eulerian' notion of a function**: Complex smoothness provides more economical way to express requirements compared to power series expansions
- **Complex perspective on troublesome 1/x**
  - From the complex point of view, `1/z` is indeed a single function
  - The one place it 'goes wrong' is at the origin `z = 0`
- **Importance of holomorphic functions**: Play vital role in later deliberations, including conformal mappings and Riemann surfaces (Chapter 8), Fourier series (Chapter 9), quantum theory and field theory (§24.3, §26.3), and new physical theories such as twistor theory (Chapter 33) and string theory (§§31.5,13,14).

---

### 7.2: Contour integration

**Contour Integration**
- Cauchy-Riemann equations: allow integration along paths that can be obtained from each other by continuous deformation within a function's domain
- For some functions, like 1/z, the domain has "holes" where continuous deformations are obstructed, leading to different answers
- Homologous vs. homotopic deformations: allow cancellation of paths with opposite directions for homologous deformations but not homotopic ones
- Topology plays an important role in understanding contour integration and its outcomes

**Example of Contour Integration:**
- Function: f(z) = 1/z
- Logarithm: log z is an indefinite integral of 1/z, with multiple "answers" that can be continuously deformed into each other by allowing b to circle around the origin
- When integrating from a to b and circling once around the origin, the value increases by 2πi (closed contour integral)
- Different answers obtained depend on the contour class used
- This property is crucial for complex analysis as it allows for non-trivial results.

---

### 7.3: Power series from complex smoothness

**Cauchy Formula for Holomorphic Functions**

**Background:**
- The Cauchy formula expresses a holomorphic function's value at the origin using an integral around a contour surrounding the origin.
- Applicable to any loop homologous to the initial one, in the domain of the function with the origin removed.

**Derivative Version:**
- Replacing 1/z with 1/zn + 1 yields the nth derivative formula at the origin (Maclaurin series).
- This 'definition' of derivatives can be used to prove the power series sums to f(z) in some region encompassing the origin.

**Implications:**
- Complex smoothness implies analyticity (holomorphicity) at any point within the domain.

**Origin Shifted Form:**
- Cauchy formula and derivative expression apply to any point p in complex plane by displacing the origin to p.

**Argument for Complex Smoothness:**
1. Premise: f(z) is complex smooth but not necessarily analytic at origin.
2. Use Cauchy's formula as a definition of derivatives.
3. Prove power series sums to f(z) in some region encompassing the origin.
4. Conclusion: Complex smoothness implies analyticity (holomorphicity) at the origin and every point within the domain.

**Importance:**
1. Reveals how mathematical playfulness can lead to significant results.
2. Elegant conception combining topological freedom with explicit expressions.
3. Provides a powerful technique for evaluating definite integrals and summing infinite series.
4. Finds applications in physics, engineering, and other areas of mathematics.

### 7.4: Analytic continuation

**Analytic Continuation**

**Open Region**:
- An open region is a set of complex numbers in the complex plane, where any point within it has a circle with interior lying within the region.
- Examples:
  - Interior of unit circle (points closer to center than circumference)
  - Single point or ordinary curve is not an open region

**Circle of Convergence**:
- For a holomorphic function f(z), there exists a circle centered at p with radius R such that the power series expansion converges for z inside the circle and diverges outside it.

**Singularities**:
- A singularity (or singular point) is a point where the function cannot be extended to while remaining complex-smooth.
- Examples: Origin, infinity

**Analytic Continuation**:
- Given a holomorphic function f(z), can we extend it to a larger domain D'?
- Frequently possible through analytic continuation
- Involves finding successive power series expressions based at different points along a path and ensuring that the circles of convergence overlap.

---

#### Exploring Analytic Continuation and the Riemann Hypothesis with Complex Functions

**Section 7.7: Analytic Continuation and Rigidity of Complex Functions**
- **Analytic continuation**: process of extending a holomorphic function to new regions in the complex plane by using functions defined on neighboring points
- Log z has no power series expansion about the origin due to its singularity there, but can be expanded around other points like p = 1
- For real-analytic functions, rigidity is evident as there's limited choice for path directions along the real line
- With complex functions, analytic continuation can be more interesting due to the freedom of choosing paths within a two-dimensional plane
- Example: log z function has different values when analytically continued around the origin in opposite directions, resulting in addition or subtraction of 2πi
- **Aside:** Analytic continuation does not necessarily rely on power series; Dirichlet series like Riemann zeta function have significance in number theory.

**Exercises:**
- Show that the residue sum around poles equals r * f(z)dz = 2πi * {sum of residues} (Section 7.4)
- Integrate z–1 e^(iz) around a closed contour (Section 7.5)
- Prove that integrating cot(πz) around a large square contour approaches 0 as N→∞ (Section 7.6)
- Find the power series of f(z) = 1/z about p point (Section 7.8)

**Notes:**
- For further information on complex analysis, refer to Needham (1997), Apostol (1976), Priestley (2003), Derbyshire (2003), du Sautoy (2003), Sabbagh (2003), and Devlin (1988, 2002).

## 8. Riemann surfaces and complex mappings 
###  8.1: The idea of a Riemann surface

**Riemann Surfaces and Complex Mappings**

**The Idea of a Riemann Surface**
- Riemann surfaces: many-sheeted regions in complex analysis
- Defined to understand 'many-valued functions' like log z
- Peculiar to the complex plane, not just a subset
- Example: log z on a winding region (Fig. 8.1)
- Functions have their own domains as Riemann surfaces
- Domains are not given ahead of time, but determined by function itself
- Beautiful concept plays an important role in modern physics, especially string theory and twistor theory

**Riemann Surface for log z**
- Simplest example of a Riemann surface
- Origin (0) is called a branch point
- Infinite order if sheets do not join after any number of turns (Fig. 8.1)
- Finite order when they join back together after a finite number of turns (e.g., za m/n)

**Riemann Surface for (1 – z³)¹/2**
- Three branch points at 1, ω, and ω²; also a branch point at infinity
- Two sheets to the Riemann surface, patched together with order 2 branch points (Fig. 8.2a)
- Topologically equivalent to a torus (Fig. 8.2b)

**General Notion of Manifolds and Its Importance in Physics**
- Spaces that look like pieces of Euclidean space locally
- Crucial concept in many areas of modern physics, especially general relativity
- Glued together from patches of coordinate space with no non-Hausdorff branching (Fig. 8.2c)

**Riemann Surfaces as Manifolds**
- Pieced together from various patches of the complex plane corresponding to different sheets
- May have missing points due to branch points of finite order but can be unambiguously replaced
- Infinite order branch points can be more complicated, and no general statement can be made (Fig. 8.3)

**The Logarithm Function's Riemann Surface as a Sphere with a Single Missing Point**
- Spiral ramp Riemann surface equivalent to a sphere with a single missing point
- The missing point can be unambiguously replaced, resulting in simply a sphere (Fig. 8.3)

---

### 8.2: Conformal mappings

**Conformal Mappings**

**Riemann Surfaces**:
- Concerned with complex smoothness, not real smoothness
- Requires matching of Cauchy-Riemann equations in order to preserve local structure

**Conformal Geometry**:
- Preserves shape on infinitesimal scale, but not size or orientation
- Can be visualized as conformal maps between regions in the complex plane
- Maintains angles between curves and preserves shapes of small objects

**Complex Smoothness (Holomorphicity)**:
- Equivalent to conformal and non-reflective transformations
- Transformation of a region from z-plane to w-plane is linear in the infinitesimal limit
- Preserves small shapes without reflection, indicating conformal and non-reflective property.

**Examples of Holomorphic Functions**:
- Adding constant b to z or multiplying by constant a are simple instances of holomorphic functions
- Reciprocal function (w = 1/z) maps complex plane with origin removed to itself, preserving circles (including straight lines as special cases)
- Combination of the above transformations forms **bilinear** or **Möbius transformations**, which map entire complex planes between open regions.

**The Riemann Sphere**:
- Maps the complex plane with a point removed to the same complex plane with another point removed
- Incorporates "∞" into both domain and target for global understanding of Riemann surfaces.

---

### 8.3: The Riemann sphere

**Riemann Sphere**
- Concept: Extending complex plane by adding a point at infinity (∞) to create a "sphere" with conformal structure
- Construction: Made from two coordinate patches, z-plane and w-plane
  - Most points have both coordinates
  - Two points have only one coordinate each: z = 0/∞ and w = 0/∞
- Definition: Using stereographic projection from south pole to map sphere points to complex plane, then reversing for w-plane
- Important Property: Circles on Riemann sphere mapped to circles or straight lines on complex planes under bilinear transformations
- Significance: Relevance to relativity theory and spinor/twistor theory

**Complex Planes and Stereographic Projection**
- z-plane represents equatorial plane of geometrical sphere
  - Points mapped via stereographic projection from south pole to complex plane
  - Represents point on sphere corresponding to complex number z
  - Infinity represented by the south pole itself (z = ∞)
- w-plane upside down and inserted into Riemann sphere from north pole
  - Stereographic projection maps circles on sphere to circles or straight lines on plane
  - Represents point on sphere corresponding to complex number w
  - Infinity represented by the north pole itself (w = ∞)

**Riemann Sphere Properties and Classification**
- Simple compact Riemann surface
- Upper half-plane of t mapped to unit disc of z under bilinear correspondence
- Non-reflective conformal maps between entire Riemann sphere and itself are achieved by bilinear transformations
- Complete classification of compact Riemann surfaces, including string theory applications.

---

### 8.4: The genus of a compact Riemann surface

**Topology Classification of Compact 2-Dimensional Oriented Surfaces**

**Genus of a Riemann Surface**:
- Topological classification is based on number of 'handles' (genus)
- Sphere: genus 0
- Torus (teacup surface): genus 1
- Pretzel surface: genus 3

**Moduli**:
- For genus ≥ 1, Riemann surfaces are not uniquely determined by their topology
- Need to specify complex parameters called **moduli** to fix the Riemann surface
- For torus (genus 1): one complex modulus, p
- For genus 2: three complex moduli

**Moduli vs. Self-Transformations**:
- For g ≥ 2, there are no continuous self-transformations, so **s = 0**
- For g = 1, can translate the parallelogram region in complex plane to specify self-transformations, requiring one complex parameter, a
- For genus 0 (sphere), need three complex ratios a:b:c:d to define self-transformations

**Conformal Freedom**:
- Conformal transformations allow altering the 'shape' of a Rieman surface while preserving its structure
- For spherical topology, many different metrical geometries are possible but conformally identical
- For higher genus, the conformal freedom reduces to finite number of complex moduli

**Subtlety of Conformal Freedom**:
- Exact information about a Riemann surface that cannot be eliminated by the use of conformal freedom is defined by the moduli.

---

### 8.5: The Riemann mapping theorem

**Riemann Mapping Theorem**
- The Riemann mapping theorem asserts that any closed region in complex plane can be mapped holomorphically to the interior of unit circle
- Boundary is also mapped accordingly
- Three distinct points on loop (a, b, c) can be mapped to three specified points (a', b', c') on unit circle with agreement in cyclic ordering
- Unique solution
- Alternative: map exterior of loop to outside of unit circle by mapping one point (a) and one additional point (j) inside it to specific points (a', ∞, j') on unit circle
- Useful for solving physical problems like airflow around an aerofoil shape using transformation like Zhoukowski's
- Simplifying assumptions: zero viscosity, incompressible, irrotational flow, constant wing height
- Exceptional cases where complex numbers and holomorphic functions have utility at macroscopic level, e.g., Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, relativity theory

---

## 9. Fourier decomposition and hyperfunctions 
###  9.1: Fourier series

**Fourier Decomposition and Hyperfunctions**

**Fourier Series**:
- In physical applications, the rigidity of analytic functions is unacceptable for modelling wave propagation
- **Joseph Fourier** addressed this by decomposing periodic functions into their constituent **pure tones**
- A periodic function `f(χ)` of period `l` can be expressed as a sum of pure tones with different magnitudes (coefficients)
  - For each positive integer `n`, the pure tone's contribution depends on the wave form of `f(χ)`
- The formula for this decomposition involves **angular frequency** `ω = 2π/l` and the complex exponential `e^(iωχ)`
- This can be written as a Laurent series

**Periodic Functions**:
- Periodic in time if `f(χ + l) = f(χ)` for all `χ`
  - Repeats the same pattern when graph is slid by period `l` along the `χ` axis
- Pure tones have period `2π`, oscillating sinusoidally between `+1` and `-1`
  - Higher harmonics have the same period `l` but oscillate more times within it

**Fourier Coefficients**:
- Determine the waveform of `f(χ)` by specifying the magnitudes of its constituent pure tones
- Given by the formula:
  - `f(χ) = c + a1 cos(ωχ) + b1 sin(ωχ) + a2 cos(2ωχ) + b2 sin(2ωχ) + ...`
  - Or, using complex exponentials: `f(χ) = C + Σ_(n=1)^∞ (a_n e^(inωχ) + b_n e^(-inωχ))`

---

### 9.2: Functions on a circle

**Fourier Decomposition and Laurent Series**

**Laurent Series:**
- Economical way to represent Fourier series
- Suggests alternative perspective on periodic functions
- Periodic function can be thought of as defined on a circle (unit circle in complex plane)
  - Circumference: l = 2π
  - Z = e^(iχ)
  - Positive or negative powers of z represent oscillatory terms

**Circle of Convergence and Annulus of Convergence:**
- In a Laurent series: F(z) = F_+ + F_-
  - F_: positive powers
  - F_: negative powers
- Circle of convergence for power series in z
  - Radius of convergence A
  - Converges for |z| < A
- Annulus of convergence for Laurent series
  - Inner circle: radius B (0 < B < A)
  - Outer circle: radius A
  - Both parts converge within the annulus

**Importance of Complex Numbers:**
- Deep insights into nature of Fourier series and quantum mechanics
- Magic of complex numbers allows extending Laurent series to non-unit circle values of z

**Fourier Series Convergence:**
- When F(z) is analytic, unit circle lies within annulus of convergence for real axis values of χ
- For non-analytic functions:
  - Annulus of convergence may shrink to the unit circle or become the outer/inner boundary
- Important for understanding behavior in §9.6 and 7.

---

### 9.3: Frequency splitting on the Riemann sphere

**Frequency Splitting on the Riemann Sphere**

**Two Patches Covering the Riemann Sphere**:
- Coordinates **z** and **w** (= 1/z) give two patches covering the Riemann sphere
- The unit circle becomes the equator of the sphere, with the annulus becoming just a 'collar' of the equator

**Frequency Splitting Requirements**:
- We think of splitting **F(z)** as expressing it as a sum of two parts:
  - Positive-frequency part of **F(z)**, extending holomorphically into the southern hemisphere
  - Negative-frequency part of **F(z)**, extending holomorphically into the northern hemisphere
- Ignoring the constant term, this splitting is uniquely determined by the holomorphicity requirement for extension into one or other hemisphere

**Orientation on Riemann Sphere**:
- The standard orientation of the unit circle in the **z-plane** is given by the direction of increase of the standard θ coordinate (anticlockwise)
- Reversing this orientation interchanges positive with negative frequency
- For a general closed loop, the orientation is anticlockwise if the 'clock face' is on the inside, and clockwise if it's on the outside

**Positive vs. Negative Frequency Components**:
- Positive-frequency components are those given by multiples of e^(iχ) with positive **n**, while negative-frequency components are given by multiples of e^(-iχ)
- A positive-frequency function is composed entirely of positive-frequency components
- The positive/negative frequency splitting is a more general notion than just picking out individual Fourier components

**Transformation to Obtain Full Range of t**:
- In quantum mechanics, positive/negative frequency refers to functions of time **t**, not assumed periodic
- A transformation can be used to obtain the full range of **t** (from -∞ to +∞) by relating **t** to z = e^(iχ), with χ going from -π to π
- Positive-frequency functions extend holomorphically into the lower half-plane of **t**, and negative-frequency functions, into the upper half-plane

---

### 9.4: The Fourier transform

**Fourier Transform**

**Overview:**
- The Fourier transform is a limit case of a Fourier series as period l approaches infinity
- It allows analysis of non-periodic functions, such as one-off signals, in terms of periodic 'pure tones'

**Advantages:**
- Allows study of wave propagation and unexpected signals without insisting on periodicity

**Components:**
1. **Limit as period l → ∞**:
   - Period becomes infinite, no restriction of periodicity on f(χ)
   - Any pure tone frequency is allowed as a Fourier component
2. **Fourier decomposition**:
   - Formula: `Σ αr e^(iωχ)` where ω = 2π/l and l = 2πN for some positive integer N
   - As N approaches infinity, it becomes inappropriate to label oscillatory components by their harmonic number
3. **Continuous variable p**:
   - Replaces r as a continuous variable in the summation
   - Coefficients αr depend on real-valued parameter p instead of discrete integer-valued parameter r
4. **Function notation**:
   - Better to write dependence of coefficients αr on continuous variable p using functional notation (g(p)) rather than just a suffix (gp) as in αrp
5. **Term zr**:
   - z = e^(iωχ), with ω = N–1
   - zr = e^(ipχ/N)
6. **Infinite limit expression for f(χ):**
   - `∫ g(p) e^(ipχ) dp` where g(p) is a measure of density
7. **Symmetry between functions**:
   - Fourier transforms f(χ) and g(p) have the same form, apart from a minus sign

**Additional Information:**
- The variable p stands for momentum in later chapters
- In the limit as N approaches infinity, we can revert to using x instead of χ if desired.

---

### 9.5: Frequency splitting from the Fourier transform

**Positive Frequency Condition**
- Function `f(χ)` is said to be of positive frequency if its Fourier transform `g(p)` is zero for all `p ≥ 0`
- This means that `f(χ)` consists only of components with frequencies less than the origin (i.e., negative frequencies)
- Another way to express this condition is in terms of the holomorphic extendability of `f(χ)` into the "outside hemisphere" on the Riemann sphere

**Singularity at Infinity**
- There is an issue with comparing the two definitions of positive frequency: how to treat the singularity at z = ∞ (infinity)
- This requires adopting the "hyperfunctional point of view" described in Section 9.7
- With this perspective, the two definitions are in basic agreement

**Change of Period**
- To change the period from `l = 2π` to larger values while maintaining the interpretation of `χ` as a distance around a circle:
  - Consider a sequence of larger and larger circles touching at the origin z = 0
  - The initial unit circle has center at z = –i, but for larger periods l > 2π, the circle's center moves off to infinity along the negative imaginary axis
- In the limiting case as `l → ∞`, we have `χ = x` measuring positive distance along the real axis

**Holomorphic Extendability**
- For finite values of `l`, the "positive frequency condition" refers to the holomorphic extendibility of `f(χ)` into the interior of the relevant circle
- In the limit as `l → ∞`, this becomes the condition that `f(χ)` be holomorphically extendible into the lower half-plane

**Fourier Series vs. Fourier Transform**
- For finite values of `l`, we can express `f(χ)` as a Fourier series by referring to a Laurent series about the center C = –il/2π
- In the limit as `l → ∞`, the Fourier series becomes the Fourier transform
- The limiting behavior of the Laurent series at z = ∞ (the center) is peculiar and requires understanding the Riemann sphere

---

### 9.6: What kind of function is appropriate?

**The Appropriateness of Functions for Fourier Transforms**

**Background:**
- Question about what kind of functions can be represented as Fourier transforms
- Analytic (Cω) functions have restrictions, but are unreasonably restrictive for many problems
- Physical motivation to study Fourier transforms: they allow treatment of non-analytic messages

**Historical Context:**
- Eulerians might consider holomorphic or analytic functions as respectable 'functions'
- However, these are too restrictive for mathematical and physical problems related to wave propagation
- Opposition from the mathematical establishment when Fourier presented non-analytic functions having valid Fourier representations
- Discussion of a square wave function example and its Laurent series representation

**Square Wave Function:**
- Not continuous, differentiable (C–1) function
- Can be represented as a sensible-looking Fourier series
- Has a reasonable-appearing Laurent series on the unit circle with shrunken annulus of convergence to the unit circle itself
- Sum of two holomorphic functions defined on half of Riemann sphere, resulting in square wave on the unit circle

**Branch Singularities:**
- Prevent power series from converging beyond the unit circle
- Allow 'sum' of two functions to 'jump' from one side to another, giving the square wave.

---

### 9.7: Hyperfunctions

**Hyperfunctions**
- Concept introduced by Mikio Sato in 1958 to represent a 'jump' between holomorphic functions on opposite sides of a curve
- Hyperfunction is defined as the pair (f, g) of holomorphic functions, with f defined on an open set R− and g on an open set R+, joined together by a real curve γ
- Two pairs (f, g) and (f0, g0) are equivalent if they differ by the addition of a holomorphic function h on the combined region R = R− ∪ R+
- The actual hyperfunction is the equivalence class of such pairs modulo h, representing the 'jump' between f and g
- Excision theorem states that the notion of a hyperfunction is independent of the choice of open regions R− and R+, as long as R contains the curve γ.

## 10. Surfaces 
###  10.1: Complex dimensions and real dimensions

**Surfaces and Dimensions**

**Modern physics and non-flat spaces**:
- Modern physics depends on remarkable techniques for handling non-flat spaces of various dimensions
- Up until now, we have considered only spaces of one dimension (complex plane, Riemann sphere) as being 1-dimensional in the context of holomorphic functions

**Complex Conjugation**:
- The operation of complex conjugation is a non-holomorphic operation
- The **complex conjugate** of z = x + iy is given by z* = x - iy
- In the complex plane, complex conjugation corresponds to a reflection in the real line
- Holomorphic operations preserve orientation, but including complex conjugation allows us to generate more general (continuous) functions
- Functions can be expressed as F(z) or f(x, y), with F(z) being the holomorphic version and f(x, y) a general version of the same function

**Example: Squaring the Modulus**:
- The function F(z) = z^2 has the real part f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2, which is the square of the modulus |z| of z.

### 10.2: Smoothness, partial derivatives

**Manifolds and Smoothness**

**2-Dimensional Surfaces**:
- Local (real) coordinates x, y can be used to label points in a 2-dimensional surface S
- The concept of smoothness applies to functions on the surface

**Examples of Smooth Functions**:
- Height function h measured from the equatorial plane
  - Smooth when h is not squared (Fig. 10.2a)
  - Non-smooth when the modulus |h| is taken (Fig. 10.2b)
  - Smooth when the square h² is considered (Fig. 10.2c)

**Smooth Functions on a Surface**:
- A smooth function Φ maps the surface S to the real numbers ℝ or complex numbers ℂ
- It can be represented as a function of local coordinates (x, y) within a patch
- **Differentiability** is required for a function f(x, y) to be considered smooth
  - A separate smoothness requirement for functions of each variable x and y
  - The derivatives with respect to x and y must be continuous functions of (x, y)

**Partial Derivatives**:
- **Partial derivatives** ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y represent the derivative of f(x, y) with respect to x and y, respectively
- The existence and continuity of these partial derivatives determine the smoothness of a function
- Higher order derivatives can be considered for greater smoothness

**Importance of Distinguishing Functions**:
- A single function Φ may be expressed differently in different coordinate systems on S
- However, the value of Φ at any specific point does not change between patches.

---

#### Differentiability and Smoothness of Real Functions in Multiple Variables

**Coordinate Patches and Smooth Functions**

**Overlap between Coordinate Patches**:
- Consider a second set of coordinates: (X, Y)
- To cover the whole of S, we may have to "glue" together several coordinate patches
- A smooth function Φ on S would have a coordinate expression: Φ = f(x, y) on one patch and Φ = F(X, Y) on another
- On an overlap region, we have f(x, y) = F(X, Y), where X and Y are smooth functions of x and y
- The particular expression that F represents in terms of the quantities X, Y will generally be quite different from the expression that f represents in terms of x and y
- **Transition functions**: Expressing the coordinates of one system in terms of the other (X = X(x, y), Y = Y(x, y)) and their inverses (x = x(X, Y), y = y(X, Y)) are called the transition functions expressing the coordinate change from one patch to another
- These transition functions must be C∞-smooth

**Differentiability of Real Function f(x, y)**

**f(x, y)**: xy/(x^2 + y^2 - N), with N = 2, 1, and 0
- For each value of N, the function is differentiable with respect to x for any fixed y value (and the same holds with the roles of x and y reversed)
- However, f(x, y) is not smooth as a function of the pair (x, y):
  - **N = 2**: The function takes arbitrarily large values near the origin (0, 0)
  - **N = 1**: The function is not actually continuous at the origin (it jumps from positive to negative values along the x-axis as y approaches 0)
  - **N = 0**: The function is continuous but has a "corner" at the origin, where the partial derivatives are discontinuous

**Polynomial Functions**

**Mixed Second Derivatives**:
- Polynomial functions have equal mixed second derivatives: ∂²f/∂y∂x = ∂²f/∂x∂y

**Function f(x, y) = xy/(x² + y²)**
- The mixed second derivatives are unequal at the origin
- The function is not continuous in its second partial derivatives at the origin (the first-order partials are discontinuous)

### 10.3: Vector fields and 1-forms

**10.3 Vector field and 1-forms**

**Derivative of a function**:
- There is a notion of 'derivative' independent of coordinate choice
- Standard notation for this is **dΦ** for a function Φ defined on a manifold S

**Confusions in the subject**:
- The term "1-form" initially tends to be thought of as an "infinitesimally small" quantity
- This is not the most general type of 1-form, which is discussed further in §10.4 and §12.6
- Formal mathematical expressions (such as those in §6.5) do not change, provided they are not divided by quantities like dx

**Interpreting 1-forms**:
- A 1-form is a geometrical entity, called a **1-form**, that has a somewhat different interpretation compared to infinitesimally small quantities
- This interpretation has grown in importance over time and will be discussed further

**Chain rule**:
- The formula above represents an instance of the "chain rule"
- It requires assigning meaning to operators like ∂Φ/∂x when Φ is a function defined on the manifold S
- Transforming these operators from one coordinate system (X, Y) to another (x, y) results in more complicated expressions

**Vector fields**:
- The quantity **ξ** represents the "vector field" associated with a function Φ
- In a particular coordinate patch (x, y), **ξ** has the form of (∂X/∂x)∂/∂x + (∂Y/∂x)∂/∂Y
- This **ξ** can be extended to other patches and the whole manifold S

**Geometrical interpretation**:
- The vector field **ξ** can be visualized as a "field of little arrows" on S
- Each arrow represents the direction in which a function, such as Φ, is to be differentiated
- The magnitude of an arrow determines the "scale" of the rate of increase of the function in that direction

---

#### Understanding Gradients, Contour Lines, and Partial Differential Equations in Multiple Coordinate Systems.

**Geometrical Interpretation of Vector Fields**
- **Measure of separation**: small positive number ϵ between points p and p′
- **Approximation to ξ (Φ)**: difference Φ(p′) - Φ(p) divided by ϵ
- **Gradient in the limit**: ξ(Φ) as p' approaches p
- **Geometrical interpretation of vector field ξ**: 'field of arrows' on surface S
- **Action on a scalar field Φ**: rate of increase along ξ arrows
- **Issue with standard mathematical notation**: partial derivatives can depend on unmentioned variables
- **Contour lines and height function analogy**

**Interpreting the Quantity dΦ (Gradient or Exterior Derivative)**
- Represents how Φ varies in all directions along S
- Tangent to contour lines gives direction of arrow ξ at a point p where ξ(Φ) = 0
- Increase or decrease in Φ occurs when crossing contours, measured by crowding of contour lines.

---

### 10.4: Components, scalar products

**Components of Vector Field and Dual Objects**

**Gradient (Exterior Derivative) dΦ**:
- Can be pictured in terms of a system of contour lines on S (constant Φ value)
- Value plotted vertically above the surface S
- Contour lines describe constant height
- Direction of contour line at point p indicates direction of gradient's "axis of tilt" or slope
- Cutting across contour lines gives increase/decrease in Φ, measured by vector field ξ (gradient)

**Components of Gradient**:
- Composed of two parts: dx and dy
- Labeled by pair of respective weighting factors (a, b)
- Strictly speaking, components are the vector fields a∂/∂x and b∂/∂y
- Term "component" now refers to coordinate labels in literature

**Scalar Product between ξ and dΦ**:
- Given by the equation: ξ(Φ) = au + bv
- Also written as dΦ • ξ or simply dΦ • ξ if abstracted from coordinate system
- Applies to more general types of 1-forms (covectors) η and vector fields ξ, forming a scalar product
- Defines a 1-form through its ability to form such a product with vector fields

**Notes**:
- 1-forms are dual objects to vector fields
- Geometric meaning of a 1-form will be explored further in §12.3 and higher dimensions

---

### 10.5: The Cauchy–Riemann equations

**Cauchy-Riemann Equations**

**Requirements for Complex Manifold Interpretation**:
- Characterize holomorphic functions Φ
- Holomorphicity is a local condition, holds in each coordinate patch and consistently on overlaps
- On x, y patch: Φ must be holomorphic in z = x + iy
- On X, Y patch: Z = X + iY must be holomorphic in z = x + iy
- Consistency between patches ensured by requiring that Z is a holomorphic function of z on overlap and vice versa.

**Expressing Holomorphicity**:
- Express condition that Φ 'depends only on z' (i.e., is independent of ) as: Re[Φ] = 0, Im[Φ] = 0
- Using chain rule, can rewrite in terms of partial derivatives as Cauchy–Riemann equations: ∂α/∂x = ∂β/∂y, ∂α/∂y = -∂β/∂x
- These conditions hold on overlaps between coordinate patches to define a Riemann surface S.

**Significance of Cauchy-Riemann Equations**:
- Allows proving results using techniques from partial differential equations existence theory
- Example: Solutions of Cauchy–Riemann equations can be obtained from solutions of 2D Laplace equation
- Laplace equation important in physics, especially for soap films and Newtonian gravitational/electrostatic fields.

**Hyperfunction Representation**:
- Any continuous function f on the unit circle in complex plane can be represented as a sum of two parts: one extending holomorphically into interior and another into exterior of the circle.
- This is equivalent to the existence of Fourier series representation, where f is treated as periodic real-valued function.

#### Dividing Function into Positive & Negative Frequency Components using the Laplace Equation

**Section 10.1: Complex Analysis and Holomorphic Functions**

**Scaling soap film argument**
- Imagine wire loop lies at unit circle in complex plane, deviating slightly up and down by values of ϵf on the unit circle
- Height of spanning soap film provides ϵf and holomorphic extension inside unit circle (negative frequency)
- Repeat procedure for exterior of unit circle (positive frequency)
- Splitting achieves required result

**Explanation from three points of view:**
1. **Intuitively**: How could a complex number appear? See Fig 10.10 and Section 10.3 for details.
2. **Holomorphic maps geometry**: Use geometry of holomorphic maps described in §8.2, Section 10.5.
3. **Explicitly**: Use chain rule and Cauchy–Riemann equations (derive them from definition of a derivative).

**Cauchy–Riemann Equations Derivation:**
- More direct derivation using function definitions
- Show this in various contexts, such as kidney-shaped region avoid non-negative u-axis.

**Section 10.2: Differentiability and First Fundamental Confusion**
- Discuss differentiability for functions of several variables (Marsden and Tromba 1996)
- Address confusion between f and Ф (Woodhouse 1991)
- Local sense condition in Section 10.5

**Cauchy–Riemann Equations:**
- Found by Jean LeRond D'Alembert in 1752, long before Cauchy or Riemann (Struik 1954)
- Soap film equation has a remarkable general solution found by Weierstrass (1866).

**Boundedness of f:**
- Since f is continuous on the circle, it must be bounded (lower and upper values)
- Rescale f by multiplying it with a small constant ϵ to make upper and lower bounds very tiny
- Prove this more rigorously using Strauss (1992) or Brown and Churchill (2004).

## 11. Hypercomplex numbers 
###  11.1: The algebra of quaternions

**The algebra of quaternions**

**Hypercomplex numbers**:
- Aimed at studying higher dimensions than complex analysis
- Renowned Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton discovered **quaternions** in 1843
- Quaternion is a **hypercomplex number**, an extension of the complex number system to three dimensions

**Properties of quaternions**:
- Satisfy the laws of algebra, except for the commutative law of multiplication
- Violation of the commutative law: `ij = –ji`
- Still satisfy the associative and distributive properties of multiplication and addition
- Provide an example of a **ring** and a **vector space** over real numbers
- Have a multiplicative inverse (division) for nonzero quaternions, forming a **division ring**

**Quaternion notation**:
- Quaternion `q`: `t + u i + v j + w k`
- Conjugate of `q`: `t – u i – v j – w k`

**Proving quaternion properties**:
- Prove the results in the text using the associative law `a(bc) = (ab)c` and the definition of a quaternion

---

### 11.2: The physical role of quaternions?

**Quaternions: Beautiful Algebraic Structure with Limited Physical Role**

**Background:**
- Quaternions discovered by Hamilton in the mid-19th century as a higher dimensional analogue of complex numbers
- Intended to provide calculus for treating physics and geometry in 3D space
- Quaternions have significant roles but have not lived up to initial promise

**Issues with Quaternions:**
1. **Dimension misconception**: Initial assumption that quaternions could represent four-dimensional spacetime
2. **Poor 'magic' compared to complex numbers**
3. **Unsatisfactory quaternionic analogue of holomorphic function**
4. **Limited division algebra property**
5. **Theorems limiting division algebras to specific dimensions (real, complex, quaternions, octonions)**

**Octonions as a Generalization:**
- Discovered by John Graves and Arthur Cayley in the mid-19th century
- Non-associative division algebra, eight-dimensional
6. **Issues with higher dimensional generalizations of quaternions:**
7. **Theorems limiting division algebras to specific dimensions (Hurwitz's result)**
8. **Division property can be preserved by abandoning certain rules**
9. **Clifford Algebra as an Important Generalization**
- Introduced by William Kingdon Clifford in 1878
- Involves new ingredients from higher dimensional space
10. **Grassmann and Clifford Algebras in Modern Physics**
- Both play important roles, especially in understanding supersymmetry (§31.3)
11. **Acquainting with Grassmann and Clifford Algebras:**
   - Consider quaternions from a geometric perspective
   - Learn about Grassmann algebra in §11.6
   - Learn about Clifford algebra in §11.5.

---

### 11.3: Geometry of quaternions

**Quaternions and Geometry**

**Basic Quaternions**:
- Refer to three mutually perpendicular (right-handed) axes in Euclidean 3-space: i, j, k
- Represent rotations about these axes

**Rotations vs. Spinors**:
- Rotations through a right angle don't work due to compound rotations
- Introduce spinors: objects that become negative after a complete rotation (2π) around any axis
  - Example: belt twisted around a book rotated 2π can be removed by rotating 4π and looping the belt over the book

**Spinorial Objects**:
- Represent an object in space with an imaginary flexible attachment to some fixed external structure (represented by the "belt")
- Configuration is equivalent if imaginary attachment can be continuously deformed into each other

**Multiplication Laws for Quaternions**:
- Rotations through π about i followed by j give a configuration equivalent to a rotation of π about k
- Sign issue: right-handed vs. left-handed rotations or axes orientation
  - Adopt convention that operator P acting on Φ is written as Ph(P) or simply PΦ

**Hamilton's Equations**:
- i² = j² = k² = ijk = –1 are satisfied by the "spinorial book" example

---

### 11.4: How to compose rotations

**Rotation Composition in Three Dimensions**

**Demonstration of Rotation Angles Being Twice What Might Seem Geometrically Appropriate:**
- Proper rotations in 3D result in a rotation about an axis when combined
- Axis and amount can be found through geometrical means using Hamilton's method

**Hamilton's Method for Rotation Composition:**
1. Represent rotations as oriented arcs on a sphere, with arrow indicating direction
2. Take the sphere to have unit radius, angle represented by distance along arc
3. For 'triangle law' to hold, rotation angle must be twice the arc length
4. Reflect triangle made by arcs in each vertex to see rotations taking one external triangle into another and their composition restoring original triangle (Fig. 11.4b)
5. In specific situations, illustrate quaternionic relation ij = k using great circle arcs on the unit sphere with half-angle π (Fig. 11.4c)
6. Rotations of a 'spinorial object' are correctly represented by vector arc description
7. In Hamilton's original version, use dual spherical triangle for demonstration instead of direct method (give an example)

**Quaternions and Rotations:**
- Relation ij = k illustrated as i(–j) = –k in Fig. 11.4c
- Rotations through angle π represented by half-angle π
- Difference between great circle arcs of length π and zero or 2π (restores sphere to original position, but not identical rotations)
8. Significance of this construction:
- Important in relativistic physics, see §18.4 for application.

---

### 11.5: Clifford algebras

**Clifford Algebras**

**Background:**
- Concept introduced to describe rotations in higher dimensions than three
- Analyze basic rotation's axis, which is a (n – 2)-dimensional space
- Rotation about an axis determined by its direction and angle of rotation
- Difference from 3D: composition of basic rotations may not result in another rotation about an (n – 2) axis
- Primary entities are reflections in hyperplanes, labeled as γ1 to γn
- Secondary entities represent π-rotations and have anticommutative properties

**Clifford Algebra:**
- General element is a sum of linear combinations of distinct products of γ's
- First-order (primary) entities are n independent γp's
- Second-order (secondary) entities: n(n – 1) independent γp γq's, etc.
- Highest-order entity is the product of all γ's and the identity element
- Space constitutes a 2n-dimensional algebra over reals
- Does not form a division ring but has practical uses in physics and mathematics

**Importance:**
- Defines spinors, which are objects upon which Clifford algebra elements act as operators
- Spinors help describe rotations in higher dimensions and play a crucial role in physics, especially in understanding the emergence of reflection non-invariant physical processes.

---

### 11.6: Grassmann algebras

**Grassmann Algebra**

**Overview:**
- Grassmann algebra is a type of degenerate Clifford algebra with basic anticommuting generating elements η's that square to zero
- Similar to the γ's of Clifford algebra but more 'systematic' and less structured than Clifford algebra

**Key Concepts:**
- Anticommutation law: ηp ∧ ηq = -ηq ∧ ηp
- Grassmann product (wedge product) of vectors a and b: a ∧ b
- Components of Grassmann products are taken to be antisymmetrized products of the components of individual vectors
- Elements in Grassmann algebra have a grade based on the number of η's 'wedge-producted' together.

**Comparison with Clifford Algebra:**
- Clifford algebra requires knowledge of what 'perpendicular' means and is concerned with orthogonality, while Grassmann algebra does not.
- Grassmann algebras are more primitive and universal than Clifford algebras as they only depend on a minimal amount of local structure.

**Applications:**
- Grassmann algebra provides a powerful means of describing the basic geometrical linear elements in arbitrary finite dimensions.

---

#### Grassmann Algebra Properties and Examples

**Grassmann Algebra and Quaternions**

**Definition of Grassmann Algebra:**
- Describes non-geometrical elements (appear later in §12.7)
- Elements have a grade, p or q
- Wedge product defined: P ∧ Q has components P[abc]Q[def]
- Sum of elements of fixed grade is an element of that same grade
- Mixed quantities can be added without interpreation issues

**Properties:**
- (p+q)-grade wedge product: [11.13, 11.14]
  * Unaltered if a is replaced by a + multiple of other vectors
  * 0 for odd p

## 12. Manifolds of n dimensions 
###  12.1: Why study higher-dimensional manifolds?

**Higher-Dimensional Manifolds and Their Significance in Physics**

**Introduction:**
- Study of higher-dimensional manifolds is essential for modern physics, including string theory
- Reasons to study n-manifolds:
  * Configuration spaces have more dimensions than ordinary spacetime (e.g., rigid body in Euclidean 3-space)
  * Distinct topology from 'trivial' Euclidean space

**Configurations Spaces:**
- Non-Euclidean 6-manifold C representing a possible location of a body in Euclidean 3-space
  * Three dimensions for position of center of gravity
  * Three more dimensions for rotational orientation
- Topological non-triviality: distinguished by the existence of non-shrinkable loops on R (rotation space) or C

**Topology and Connectedness:**
- Simply connected vs. multiply connected spaces
  * Shrinkability property of loops
    + Sphere and plane are simply connected because all closed loops can be shrunk away
    + Torus and surfaces of higher genus are multiply connected due to the existence of non-shrinkable loops
- Application to R and C: their rotation loops cannot be continuously deformed to a point, so they are multiply connected. This is illustrated by topological torsion.

**Large Dimensions in Physics:**
- Configuration spaces (K) and phase spaces (P) for systems involving many particles
  * Large dimensions due to multiple particles with positions and momenta
    + K has 3N dimensions for N particles
    + P has 6N dimensions for N particles
  * Relevance in studying behavior of physical systems with large numbers of particles.

---

### 12.2: Manifolds and coordinate patches

**Manifolds and Coordinate Patches**

**Construction of Manifolds**
- Similar to constructing surfaces using coordinate patches
- Require more coordinates per patch (n) than just x, y or X, Y
- Distinguish coordinates with numerical indices: x1, x2, ..., xn
  - Not different powers of a single quantity
  - Confusion between coordinate and cube of a quantity

**Picturing Manifolds**
- 'Glued together' from open regions in **ℝn**, the coordinate space
- Each patch has transition functions to relate coordinates between patches
  * Consistency conditions ensure whole procedure is valid

**Hausdorff Spaces**
- Important property for manifolds to have
- Any two distinct points have non-overlapping neighborhoods
- Prevents 'branching' in the manifold (Fig. 12.5b)

**Manifold as a Mathematical Structure**
- Not aware of specific coordinate patches or values
- Can be built using coordinate patches but then forgotten as an auxiliary tool for analysis when needed.

---

### 12.3: Scalars, vectors, and covectors

**Scalars, Vectors, and Covectors**
- **Smooth function (Phi)**: Defined on M, can be interpreted as a scalar field on M
- **Vector field (xi)**: Acts on scalars to produce other scalars, satisfies certain algebraic relations like d(f + g) = df + dg
- **Covector field (alpha)**: Can be thought of as a map from vector fields to scalar fields, defined by the relation α • ξ = α • ξ for any vectors ξ and η and scalar field Φ
- **Vectors at a point o**: Provide the structure of the manifold in the immediate neighborhood of o, called the **tangent space To**, which can be understood as an infinitely stretched out version of M near o. The tangent space has finite dimension n and provides a basis for any element in To.
- **Cotangent space**: Dual vector space to the tangent space, called the cotangent space at o
- **Gradient (dΦ)**: Special case of a covector field, defined as the exterior derivative of a scalar field Φ, satisfying the property dΦ • ξ = ξ (Φ). A covector can be expressed in this way at any single point.
- Difference between vectors and covctors: At each point on M, a non-zero covector determines an (n – 1)-dimensional plane element, where directions within the plane are determined by vectors that make α • ξ = 0. In the case when α = dΦ, these (n – 1)-plane elements are tangential to families of constant Phi surfaces.

---

#### Vector and Covector Components in Coordinate Patches

**Vector and Covector Fields in n-Dimensional Space**

**Representation of Vector Field:**
- Represents a vector (field) `ξ` by its set of components `(ξ₁, ξ₂, …, ξn)` within a coordinate patch.
- Each component is the coefficient of the partial derivative operator `∂/∂xi r` with respect to each local coordinate axis.

**Representation of Covector Field:**
- Represents a covector (field) `α` by its set of components `(α₁, α₂, …, αn)`.
- Each component is the coefficient in the expression for `α = α₁ dx₁ + α₂ dx₂ + … + αn dnx`, where `dxr` stands for the gradient of the local coordinate xr.

**Plane Elements:**
- A non-zero covector `α` at a point determines an (n–1)-dimensional plane element there.
- The vectors satisfying `α • ξ = 0` define the directions within this plane element.
- In general, covector fields would twist around and prevent touching a single family of (n–1)-surfaces, except when `α = dΦ` (for a scalar field Φ).

**Scalar Product:**
- The scalar product `α • ξ` is given by the expression: `[α₁ dx₁ + α₂ dx₂ + … + αn dnx] • [ξ₁ ∂/∂xi 1 + ξ₂ ∂/∂xi 2 + … + ξn ∂/∂xi n]`.
- This can be derived by applying the linearity requirement of a covector as specified in the text.

---

### 12.4: Grassmann products

**Grassmann Products and Plane Elements**

**Bivectors**:
- Representation of a 2-plane element at a point in M: ξ ⊗ η, where ξ and η are independent vectors spanning the 2-plane
- Components of a bivector: antisymmetric expressions given by Eq. (11.6)
- A sum of simple bivectors is also called a bivector

**Trivectors**:
- Representation of a 3-plane element (or field): ξ ⊗ η ⊗ ζ, where ξ, η, and ζ span the 3-plane
- Components: completely antisymmetric (as for general n-vectors)

**General p-Forms**:
- Defined similarly as wedge products of p independent 1-forms α, β, ..., δ
- Determines an (n-p)-plane element (intersection of various (n-1)-plane elements)
- Simple p-form: represents a p-plane element or field
- General p-form: not expressible as a direct wedge product of covectors, but a sum of terms that are
- Components: antisymmetric set of quantities φrs…u (p indices), satisfying Eq. (12.7)
- Wedge product of p-forms and q-forms: has components given by Eq. (12.8)

**Notes**:
- Distinction between representing an (n-1)-plane element as a 1-form or an (n-1)-vector: the 1-form is a "density", while the (n-1)-vector is not
- General p-forms are antisymmetric in their indices, just like general p-vectors

---

### 12.5: Integrals of forms

**Integrals of Forms**

**Integrating Densities**:
- In physics, density is mass per unit volume
- This density is a property of the material's composition
- Integration involves integrating the density over the object's volume

**1-Form Integral**:
- 1-form integral: integration along a curve (1-dimensional manifold)
- Written as **∫f(x) dx**, where `x` is a parameter along the curve
- This notation is consistent with the exterior calculus scheme introduced by Élie Cartan

**Exterior Calculus**:
- Cartan's exterior calculus deals with integrals over higher-dimensional regions
- A 2-form, like `f(x,y) dx ∧ dy`, can be integrated over a 2-dimensional region
- This applies to 3-forms integrated over 3-dimensional regions and so on
- The wedge product and exterior derivative in Cartan's notation handle these integrals

**Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus**:
- In higher dimensions, there is an analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- It is part of Cartan's exterior calculus and will be called "the fundamental theorem of exterior calculus"

---

### 12.6: Exterior derivative

**Exterior Derivative and Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus**

**Exterior Derivative**:
- Unique operator 'd' taking p-forms to (p+1)-forms
- Properties:
  - Linearity: d(α + β) = dα + dβ
  - Product rule: d(α ∧ γ) = dα ∧ γ + (-1)p α ∧ dγ
  - Differentiating a function (0-form): dΦ = gradient of Φ
- Important property: **d² = 0**

**Poincaré Lemma**:
- If a 1-form α satisfies dα = 0, then locally it has the form α = dΦ for some function Φ.

**Exterior Derivative in Components**:
- For a p-form α, represented by antisymmetrical components α[r...t]
- The exterior derivative of α is a (p+1)-form, written as dα
- Components are given by the formula: (dα)[r...t] = Σₖ∂α[i...j]/∂xi, where i, j are antisymmetrized indices.

**Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus**:
- Expresses the exterior derivative of a p-form φ in terms of its integral over a compact, oriented (p+1)-dimensional region R with boundary ∂R.
- Provides a relationship between the integrals of the components of dφ and the integrals of the components of φ evaluated on the boundary ∂R.

---

#### Boundary Theory and Exterior Calculus in Geometry

**Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus**
- The original 1D version of calculus is a special case of exterior calculus when R is a line segment.
- Boundary of well-behaved compact oriented (p + 1)-dimensional region R:
  - Consists of those points in R that do not lie in its interior
  - Is a (compact oriented) p-dimensional region, possibly empty
  - Its boundary ∂R is denoted by ∂∂ R and is empty

**Orientation**
- A (multi-component) 0-manifold: assigns 'positive' (+) or 'negative' (-) value to each point
- For a curve (1-manifold): orientation provides a direction along the curve represented by an arrow
- For a surface (2-manifold): orientation can be indicated by a tiny circular arc with an arrow, representing the positive direction of rotation of tangent vector
- For a 3-manifold: orientation specifies right-handed triads of independent vectors at a point

**Möbius Strip (Non-orientable Space)**
- The Möbius strip has a non-empty boundary consisting of two circles, but the orientation cannot be consistently assigned due to its non-orientability

### 12.7: Volume element

**Volume Element, Summation Convention**

**Relationship between n-form and scalar field:**
- For an n-manifold M with p = n, the associated n-surface element at a point o is the entire tangent n-plane at o.
- This n-density (assumed nowhere zero) is called a **volume element**.
- Can be used to convert (n–p)-vectors to p-forms and vice versa.

**Converting (n–p)-vector to p-form:**
- Represented by a quantity εr…w in each coordinate patch.
- Use tensor algebra operations, like contraction or transvection, to glue n upper indices of ψu…w to the n lower indices of ε r…w.
- The summation convention: assume a summation between a lower and an upper index whenever the same index letter appears both times in a term, with summation over index values 1, …, n.

**Example: Scalar product (§12.3)**
- Combines components βr of a covector β with components ξr of a vector ξ by multiplying corresponding elements and summing over repeated index r.

**p-form in terms of a corresponding (n–p)-vector:**
- Formula: α = ψ⊤ε, where ψ is the (n–p)-vector, ε is the volume form, and the summation refers to the repeated indices u, …, w.

**Duality between p-form and (n–p)-vector:**
- If α and ψ are dual to each other, there is an inverse formula for some suitable reciprocal volume form (n-vector) ϵ.
- The condition for a simple p-form or q-vector:
  α ∧ *ψ = δijk, where all indices of the first factor are ‘skewed’ with just one index of the second factor.

**Symmetry:**
- Dual of a simple p-form is a simple (n–p)-vector and conversely.

### 12.8: Tensors

**Abstract-Index and Diagrammatic Notation for Tensors**

**Mathematician vs. Physicist Notations**:
- Mathematician's notation: index-independent, geometric/algebraic terms, but unmanageable for complex calculations
- Physicist's notation: component-dependent, summation convention, flexible and useful for complex calculations

**Abstract-Index Notation**:
- Retains practical advantages of index notation without the conceptual drawbacks
- Abstract indices are just markers, not coordinated to specific systems

**Diagrammatic Notation**:
- Represents tensors as distinctive symbols (rectangle or oval) with legs and arms
- Lines represent contracted indices; upper to lower for tensor contraction
- Antisymmetrization represented by a bar, symmetrization by a wiggly bar
- Eases the difficulties of managing small indices in abstract-index notation

**Examples**:
- Fig. 12.17 and 12.18 illustrate various tensor representations using diagrammatic notation

**Additional Practical Advantages**:
- Particularly useful in spinor-based formalisms
- Convenient for handwritten calculations

**Drawbacks**:
- Difficult to print in ordinary way
- Takes time to learn and master

**Equivalence of Conditions for Simplicity**:
- Confirm the equivalence of all these conditions; prove the sufficiency of α[rs α u]v = 0 when p = 2 (hint: contract with two vectors)

---

### 12.9: Complex manifolds

**Complex Manifolds and Riemann Surfaces**

**Riemann Surface**:
- When thinking of Riemann surface as 1-dimensional, it is in terms of holomorphic operations on complex numbers
- Similarly, higher-dimensional manifolds can be considered with complex coordinates and holomorphic functions
- Manifold "glued together" from open regions in the coordinate space of complex numbers

**Complex Coordinates vs. Real Coordinates**:
- Complex coordinates can be expressed in terms of real and imaginary parts (xj, yj) or including complex conjugation
- The "complex structure" describes how the real vector fields ξ and η have to be related to qualify as holomorphic
- J operation reverses sign when applied twice, defining an almost complex structure

**Complex Manifolds vs. Real 2n-Manifold**:
- Complex manifolds can be reinterpreted as a real 2n-manifold with a specific local structure (complex structure)
- Newlander–Nirenberg theorem allows moving between the two philosophical standpoints

**Shrinkability Argument in Topology**:
- A closed loop representing a 2π-rotation cannot be continuously deformed to a point (homotopy)
- Multiple-connectedness is part of homotopy theory, not allowed for cancellation

## 13. Symmetry groups 
###  13.1: Groups of transformations

**Symmetry Groups and Transformations**

**Importance of Symmetric Spaces in Physics**:
- Spaces that are symmetrical have a fundamental importance in modern physics
- The idea is that physical interactions, including gravity, act in accordance with an exact symmetry at a fundamental level

**Concept of Gauge Connection**:
- This concept enables finding a subtle notion of differentiation on general entities on a manifold
- It will be explored further in the following two chapters

**Symmetries of a Square**:
- Symmetries are generated by a single right-angle rotation repeated various times
- These rotations can be represented as multiplication by "i" (a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation) in the complex plane
- There are four distinct elements: 1, i, -1, and -i, which generate all the symmetries of the square (excluding orientation reversals)
- This set of elements forms a group under multiplication, with the group axioms holding

**Adding Orientation Reversals**:
- Allowing orientation reversals doubles the number of distinct elements in the group to 8
- The "multiplication" operation now includes complex conjugation ("C") to flip the square over
- This leads to non-Abelian multiplication laws, as opposed to the Abelian multiplication possible without orientation reversals
- The total number of distinct elements is called the group's order

#### Rotational Symmetry of Spheres: Finite vs Continuous Groups in 3D Space

**Symmetry Group of an Ordinary Sphere: SO(3) and O(3)**

**SO(3)**
- Symmetry group without reflections
- Infinite number of elements
- Constitutes a 3-dimensional manifold, called **SO(3)** or the non-reflective orthogonal group in 3 dimensions
- Subgroup of **O(3)**

**O(3)**
- Includes reflections, resulting in disconnected 3-manifold
- Consists of two connected pieces: one containing the identity element and SO(3), the other reflective symmetries

**Properties Common to Finite and Continuous Groups**
1. **a = a**: identity property
2. **a –1 = a\n{}^{-1}**: inverse property
3. **associativity**: **ab × c = (ac) × b**

**Difference Between SO(3) and O(3)**
- Only SO(3) is Abelian, as O(3) includes non-commutative reflections

**Group Properties Verification**
1. Prove that **a\n{}^{-1}a = 1** from **a\n{}^{-1}a = a\n{}^{-1}**, **a\n{}^{-1}a = 1**, and **ab = ba** (associativity)
2. Explain why vector spaces are Abelian groups, as they use addition as the 'group multiplication' operation
3. Verify the given relations for the C\_{i} operations with the identity element 1 and unit vector i
4. Show that SO(3) is a subgroup of O(3)

**Exercise Solutions**
1. Prove **a\n{}^{-1}a = 1**:
   - Multiply both sides of **a\n{}^{-1}a** by **a\n{}^{-1}**: **a\n{}^{-1}(a\n{}^{-1}a) = (a\n{}^{-1}a)\n{}^{-1}**
   - Simplify using associativity and the identity property: **a\n{}^{-1} = a\n{}^{-1}**, since both sides are equal to the identity element.
2. Any vector space is an Abelian group because it follows the closure, associativity, commutative, and identity properties for addition, which is its 'group multiplication' operation.
3. Verify the given relations by checking their effects on 1 and i: **C\_{i}(1) = 1**, **C\_{i}(i) = k\n{i}** (a constant), and **C\_{i}(C\_{i}(x)) = C\_{i}(C\_{i}(x)) = x** for any vector x.
4. To prove that SO(3) is a subgroup of O(3), we need to show:
   - It's a group: contains an identity element (1) and closure property (product of any two elements in the set)
   - It's a subset of O(3): every element in SO(3) belongs to O(3).

### 13.2: Subgroups and simple groups

**Subgroups and Simple Groups**

**Importance of Subgroups:**
- Identifying subgroups is significant in modern physics theories
- Helps understand manifest symmetries as subgroups of a 'fundamental' group

**Examples of Subgroups:**
1. Non-reflective symmetries of the square: {1, i, –1, –i} and SO(3)
2. Rotation group SO(3) is a subgroup of O(3)
3. Trivial subgroups: identity element alone {1} or entire group G itself
4. Non-normal subgroups: {1, C} and {1, Ci} in symmetry group of square (Fig. 13.3a, b)
5. Marking specific points on sphere leads to non-normal subgroups (Fig. 13.3c, d)

**Normal Subgroups:**
- Elements commute with normal subgroup (gS = Sg for all g in G)
- If a group G has a non-trivial normal subgroup S, it can be broken down into smaller groups (cosets of G by S)

**Factor Group:**
- Factor group G/S is formed from distinct cosets of the normal subgroup S under multiplication, satisfying all group axioms if S is normal.

**Simple Groups:**
- A group with no non-trivial normal subgroups is called a simple group. Examples include SO(3).

**Importance of Simple Groups:**
- Basic building blocks in group theory, all finite and continuous simple groups are known.

### 13.3: Linear transformations and matrices

**Linear Transformations and Matrices**

**Symmetries of Vector Spaces**:
- Symmetries are expressed through linear transformations that preserve the vector-space structure
- Linear transformations: Preserve addition (parallelogram law) and multiplication by scalars
- Linear transformation can take a vector space to another

**Linear Transformation Representation**:

- The index notation allows for a compact representation

**Matrix Representation**:
- A set of components (Ta b) referred to as an n × n matrix
- Tx stands for the transformation x ↦ Tx, where x is an abstract indexed variable
- Diagrammatic notation can also be used to represent the linear transformation

- String linear transformations in a line downwards

**Identity Transformation (I)**:
- Represents the "disembodied" Kronecker delta (I)
- Algebraic relations: TI = T = IT
- Square matrix of components has 1s on the main diagonal

**Singular Linear Transformations**:
- Maps entire vector space to a region of smaller dimension
- Equivalent to having a non-zero vector Tυ = 0
- Non-singular transformations have an inverse (T−1)

**Inverse of a Matrix (T−1)**:
- Given explicitly in diagrammatic form using Levi-Civita antisymmetric quantities

### 13.4: Determinants and traces

**Determinants and Traces**

**Determinant**:
- Calculated from elements of an n × n matrix
- Vanishes if and only if the matrix is singular
- Conveniently described diagrammatically (Fig. 13.8a)
- Determinant of a product of two matrices: det(AB) = det(A) * det(B)
- Connection with traces: infinitesimal linear transformation determinant = 1 + ε trace A

**Trace**:
- Sum of elements along the main diagonal of a matrix (i.e., trace T = Ta aa = Ti i)
- No particular relation between the trace of a product AB and the traces of A and B individually; we have the relation trace(A + B) = trace A + trace B instead

**Determinant and Trace Connection**:
- There is an important connection between determinants and traces, especially for infinitesimal linear transformations (I + εA): det(I + εA) = 1 + εtrace A.
- The extended version of this formula for finite linear transformations: det eA = etrace A, where "eA" follows the same definition as it does for ordinary numbers.

**Additional Questions**:

---

### 13.5: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

**Linear Transformations and Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors**

**Important notions:**
- **Eigenvalues**: complex numbers that determine how a linear transformation (T) affects a non-zero vector υ, with the equation Tυ = λυ holding true for some complex number λ.
- **Eigenvectors**: vectors sent to multiples of themselves by T; they unaltered under the application of T and form spaces through the origin.
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are related via the determinant det(T - λI) = 0, which leads to a polynomial equation in λ with roots being eigenvalues. Multiplicity m of an eigenvalue λ r is the number of times it appears as a factor. The total number of eigenvalues equals n for an n × n matrix.
- **Basis**: a set of linearly independent vectors that uniquely represent any element in a vector space V through linear combinations. A non-singular transformation T sends one basis to another, and components of vectors with respect to different bases can be related using matrices.
- When all multiplicities satisfy the condition d = r (eigenspace dimensionality equals multiplicity), there exists a basis consisting entirely of eigenvectors for V. In this case, T represents the diagonal matrix form when referred to the e basis. This is useful both conceptually and calculationally.

**Questions:**
- Can you express the coefficients of the polynomial in diagrammatic form? (For n = 2 and 3)
- Show that det(T) = λ1·λ2···λn, trace(T) = λ1 + λ2 + ... + λn.
- Prove that a linear relation between vectors in a collection of r linearly independent eigenvectors leads to a contradiction when pre-multiplied by T.

### 13.6: Representation theory and Lie algebras

**Representation Theory and Lie Algebras**

**Group Representation**:
- Finding a subgroup of GL(n) (multiplicative group of n × n matrices) that preserves the multiplication law in a given group G
- A faithful representation is one where T(g) is different from T(h) when g is different from h, allowing for an identical copy of the group G in GL(n)
- Every finite group has a faithful representation in some GL(n), but not every continuous group has a faithful representation

**Lie Algebras**:
- Infinitesimal elements of a continuous group G are represented by matrices I + εA, where ε is "small"
- The sum A + B represents the product of two infinitesimal elements, but the group G may be non-Abelian
- Non-Abelian nature is expressed through the group commutators [a, b] = ab - ba
- Lie algebra constructed by applying the +, -, and bracket operations [,], with multiplication by ordinary numbers also allowed
- The additive aspect has a vector-space structure, while Lie bracket satisfies certain properties like distributivity and antisymmetry

---

### 13.7: Tensor representation spaces

**Reducibility and Tensor Representation Spaces**

**Representation Spaces**:
- A representation space for a group G is a vector space V with elements x represented by linear transformations T(x) = T(V)x, where T is a family of linear transformations in the group G.
- Each element g ∈ G is represented by a corresponding transformation in T.
- The index notation (xa → Ta(xb)) and diagrammatic form are used to represent these transformations.

**Finding Other Representation Spaces**:
- The dual space V* of a representation space V can be used to find other representation spaces for G, as shown by the transformation equation S = T^−1, where S is the inverse of T.
- The transpose AT of a matrix A is used more commonly than the standard multiplication ordering.
- The tensor product of q copies of the dual space V* and p copies of V can be constructed from a vector space, forming a representation space for G.

**Reducibility**:
- Representation spaces are often reducible, meaning they can be split into symmetric and antisymmetric parts (Qab = Q(ab) + Q[ab]).
- Reducible representations have dimensions np+q that are smaller than the total number of components in an irreducible representation.
- A direct sum of two smaller representations A and B is a reducible representation, while an irreducible representation cannot be decomposed into smaller parts with non-zero C matrices.
- A completely reducible representation is a direct sum of irreducible representations.

---

#### Semi-simple Lie Groups and Their Representation Theory

**Compact Semi-Simple Groups**

**Semi-simple groups**:

- Sufficient to study irreducible representations, which are finite-dimensional

**Killing Form**:
- Quantity constructed from structure constants **γαβχ** that define Lie brackets
- Given by the expression in [13.44] (Fig. 13.14)
- Condition for G to be semi-simple is that the matrix **kαβ** be non-singular

**Compactness**:
- Real vs. complex Lie algebras:
  - Complex case does not yield a compact group G
  - Compactness occurs in real case when **−κβα** is positive definite (defined in §13.8)
- Different real forms of a complex semi-simple group may give the same complexification \ℂG
- Each complex semi-simple Lie group has exactly one real form G that is compact

### 13.8: Orthogonal groups

**Orthogonal Groups**

**Representation of Orthogonal Group (O(3) or SO(3)):**
- Faithful representation as linear transformations on a 3D real vector space
- Sphere with equation g\_ab x\_a x\_b = 1 left invariant

**Relations between Matrices and their Inverses**:
- Linear transformation applied to coordinates: t\_{ab} = sa\_{ab} (non-singular, invertible matrix)
- Similar but different from passive transformation of a tensor

**Passive Transformation vs. Active Transformation**:
- Passive transformation leaves the vector space pointwise fixed
- Coordinate representation changes: new basis replaces old one
- Components of a tensor are unaltered for passive transformations, but not for gab\_{ab}

**Signature of a Matrix**:
- Invariant number (p, q) of 1s and –1s in the main diagonal
- Not always reducible to Kronecker delta by real linear transformation
- Singular matrices also have signatures with 0s along the main diagonal

**Positive-Definite Matrix**:
- Non-singular matrix with all positive components (p=0, q≠0)
- Also called a metric or pseudometric in certain contexts

**Terminology for Symmetric Matrices:**
- Positive-definite matrix: ds^2 = gab\_{ab} dx\_a dx\_b > 0 for all non-zero vectors x
- Non-negative-definite (or positive-semi-definite) if ds^2 >= 0

**Applications:**
- Metric or pseudometric tensor used to measure distance in curved manifolds and relativity theory.

---

#### Orthogonal Groups and Signature Invariants in Linear Transformations

**Orthogonal Transformations and Orthogonal Groups**

**Definition of Orthogonal Transformations:**
- Preserve a given positive-definite metric tensor g
- Satisfy the condition that the dot product of two transformed vectors remains unchanged: gab T a·b c = gcd
- Can be realized as orthogonal matrices satisfying T−1 = TT

**Orthogonal Matrices vs. Orthogonal Transformations:**
- Orthogonal matrices are realizations of the orthogonal transformations in n dimensions (n × n)
- For non-reflective group SO(n), determinant is equal to unity: det(T) = 1

**Pseudo-Orthogonal Groups O(p, q):**
- Obtained when the metric tensor g is not necessarily positive definite but non-singular (signature p,q)
- Includes Lorentz group for p = 1 and q = 3 (or equivalently, p = 3 and q = 1), which plays a fundamental role in relativity theory

**Differences Between Orthogonal Groups:**
- Closely related but distinct real forms of one complex group O(n, ℂ)
- Different groups have the same dimension (n - 1) and are called realizations of the same complex group
- Distinctions between these groups can be important for physics applications

**Complex Linear Coordinate Transformations:**
- Can convert a –1 in a diagonal realization of gab into a +1 and vice versa, so no meaningful notion of signature

**Rank vs. Signature:**
- Invariant in complex case is rank (number of non-zero terms in diagonal realization)
- For non-singular g, rank must be maximal (n)

**Physicists' Approach to Distinctions Between Real Forms:**
- Sometimes cavalier about distinctions
- Different real forms have significant implications for physics, but insights can be obtained by ignoring these differences in some cases
- Quantum theory may violate inequalities on matrix elements, blurring the distinction between different signatures.

---

### 13.9: Unitary groups

**Unitary Groups and Unitary Transformations**

**Unitary Transformations**:
- Preserve a Hermitian form, rather than a quadratic or symmetric bilinear form
- Maintain the Hermitian symmetry and linearity in the second variable properties of a Hermitian form
- Differ from orthogonal transformations, which preserve a non-singular symmetric bilinear form

**Hermitian Forms**:
- Similar to quadratic forms, but use complex linear transformations
- Preserved by unitary transformations
- Provide a means of identifying the vector space V with its dual space V\*:
  - For each x in V, h(x) is an element of V* that maps another vector y to h(x, y) = h(y, x)
  - The inverse operation involves raising the index using the inverse metric tensor g\_ab
- Differ from symmetric bilinear forms in that the form h(v,) depends antilinearly on the complex-conjugate vector v, rather than linearly

**Complex Conjugation**:
- **Complex conjugation**, or **Hermitian conjugation**, is an operation that incorporates the identification of the complex-conjugate space with the dual space into the notion of complex conjugation
- The asterisk (*) operator maps a tensor of valence [n] to a tensor of valence [n], where upper indices become lower and lower indices become upper
- It is an equivalent notion to the Hermitian form h\_ab itself, especially when the components ha'b are taken to be Kronecker deltas

- Preserves products of tensors, but reverses order of contractions
- Reverses multiplication order for linear transformations LM: (LM)^* = M * L *
- Conveniently depicted as reflection in a horizontal plane in diagrammatic notation

**Hermitian Scalar Product**:
- Scalar product between covector υ and vector w, with respect to the Hermitian conjugation (*) operation
- Given by: 〈γ|w〉 = γ*•w
- Particular case when w = γ gives the norm of γ with respect to *

**Basis and Signature**:
- Choosing a basis (e1, ..., en), components ha'b in this basis are elements of Hermitian matrix
- Pseudo-orthonormal if: ei⋅ei = +1 for all signs, orthonormal when all signs are 1
- Signature (p,q) defined by the total number of 1s and –1s with respect to *
- Positive-definite if q = 0, unitary/pseudo-unitary transformations depend on the case

**Unitary Transformations**:
- Linear transformation T whose inverse is T^*
- In the case of usual conjugate transpose operation, called a **unitary matrix**
- Group of unitary transformations in n dimensions: U(n)

### 13.10: Symplectic groups

**Symplectic Groups**

**Definition:**
- Symplectic groups: real forms of complex symplectic group Sp(n, C) preserving a non-singular antisymmetric bilinear form
- Important in classical and quantum physics (especially in mechanics and twistor theory)

**Properties:**
- Preserve non-singular antisymmetric form sab
- Can be defined as real forms of Sp(n, C) or intersections with U(p, q)
- Comes in different real forms depending on signature (p, q), where p + q = n
- Split-signature case: Sp(n, n)
- In the compact case, has signature (n, 0) or (0, n)

**Examples:**
- Symplectic group of real transformations preserving a non-singular antisymmetric form is called symplectic group
- Other examples: SU(2), Sp(1), SL(2, C), SO(2, 1), and SU(2, 2) are the same or locally the same as some orthogonal or unitary groups.

**Importance in Physics:**

- In the unitary case, requires the trace of X to vanish and restriction to SU(n)

**Classical Groups Dimensions**
- m(m+2) for symplectic groups
- m(2m+1) for orthogonal groups
- m(2m+1) for special linear groups Sp(m)
- m(2m–1) for orthogonal groups SO(2m)

**Gauge Theories in Physics**
- Modern physics governed by 'gauge connections' which depend on spaces having exact symmetries
- Gauge theories revealed in Chapter 15

#### Geometric Algebra and Spinorial Objects in Linear Transformations

**Group Theory: SL(n, R) and Its Double Cover**

**Double cover of SL(n, R)**
- Obtained from SL(n, R) in a similar way as finding the double cover of SO(3) in §13.3
- Group of non-reflective rotations of a spinorial object in 3D space (just like 3 is the group of rotations)
- Arrives at group (n, R), which is locally the same as SL(n, R), but cannot be faithfully represented in GL(m)

**Other Notions Named After Cartan vs. Killing:**
- Many important notions attributed to Cartan were originally due to Killing (e.g., 'Cartan sub-algebra, Cartan integer')
- The term 'Killing form' is actually due to Cartan and Hermann Weyl
- However, the term 'Killing vector' in §30.6 was originally due to Killing

**Mathematical Concepts:**
- Strictly mathematical term for 'same' is 'isomorphic'
- Procedure of finding dual basis: given a basis e = (ei), associate a dual basis e* with the property that ei • ej = δij

**Components of Tensors:**
- Components obtained by applying multilinear functions to collections of p dual basis elements and q basis elements
- For example, for Q: Qij... = (ei...) • Q • (ej...)

**Positive-Definite Case:**
- The matrix Σ is a dual basis to the standard basis in this case

**Complexification:**
- U(p, q) and GL(n, ℝ) all have the same complexification: GL(n, ℂ)
- These can be regarded as different real forms of the complex group

**Sp(p, q)**
- Every element in Sp(n, ℂ) has unit determinant, so no need for an SSp(n) by analogy with SO(n) and SU(n)
- Reason: there's an expression (the Pfaffian) for Levi-Civita's ε... that must be preserved whenever sab are.

## 14. Calculus on manifolds 
###  14.1: Diferentiation on a manifold?

**Calculus on Manifolds**

**Differentiation on a Manifold**:
- In Chapter 13, saw how symmetry groups act on vector spaces through linear transformations of these spaces
- This "structure" can be a metric or Hermitian structure preserved by the transformations
- Representation theory of groups as actions on vector spaces is important in many areas of mathematics and physics, especially quantum theory

**Affine Spaces**:
- Vector space is a special type of space, with a distinguished origin (zero vector)
- Euclidean geometry is an example of an **affine space**
- Affine space is like a vector space but the origin is "forgotten"
- Allows for defining vector addition by the "parallelogram law"

**Curved Spacetime and Phase Spaces**:
- Einstein's theory of general relativity involves a **4-manifold** with local structure, over and above just a smooth manifold
- Configuration spaces and phase spaces in physics also have local structures (metric, symplectic)
- These play vital roles in modern physical theory

**Calculus on Manifolds**:
- A smooth, unstructured n-dimensional manifold has relatively few meaningful calculus-based operations
- We do not have a general notion of differentiation that can be applied generally within the manifold
- The **exterior derivative** is a limited operation that applies only to p-forms and does not give much information about how a tensor field varies
- Desire for a coordinate-independent calculus to express how a vector or tensor field varies as we move through the manifold

---

### 14.2: Parallel transport

**Parallel Transport**

**Difficulty with Scalar Fields**:
- Concept of rate of change (dΦ) for scalar fields does not apply to tensor quantities like vector fields
- Constancy of a scalar field (dΦ = 0) is straightforward, but this concept does not extend to general manifolds

**Vector 'Constancy'**:
- In Euclidean space, a constant vector field should have all arrows pointing in the same direction
- Notion of parallelism would be needed for a 'non-constant' vector ξ
- The problem is that there is no consistent notion of parallelism on a general smooth n-manifold M

**Parallel Transport on Sphere S2**:
- Intrinsic geometry of sphere S2 requires a new concept of parallelism
- Path-dependence arises when pulling the direction of a vector back into the tangent plane at other points
- This path-dependent notion of parallelism is important for understanding modern theories of particle interactions and general relativity

**Parallel Transport Procedure**:
- Start at point p with tangent vector υ, move along a path γ
- Project υ into the tangent space at each intermediate point pr, moving it parallel to itself
- In the limit, this procedure yields a well-defined answer that does not depend on the details of approximating γ
- This process is referred to as **parallel transport** of the vector ξ along γ

---

#### Parallel transport discrepancy on spherical geometry due to path dependence.

**Parallel Transport and Angular Discrepancies on Spherical Surfaces**

**Geometry of Fig. 14.3:**
- Points p and q marked on S2 (a sphere of unit radius)
- Two paths from p to q: direct great-circle route vs. pair of great-circle arcs with intermediate point r
- Parallel transport along these paths results in different final rotations of vector υ

**Parallel Transport Preservation:**
- Length of vector is preserved during parallel transport due to general reasons
- Angular discrepancies arise when the path has a corner or when it's a closed loop (Fig. 14.4)

**Extreme Form of Discrepancy:**
- When path γ is a closed loop, there may be significant angle rotation between initial and final directions of parallel-transported tangent vector
- For an exact geometrical sphere, this discrepancy equals the total area of the loop in radians (Hariot's 1603 formula for spherical triangle, §2.6)

**Confirming the Assertion:**
- Assume Hariot's formula for calculating the area of a spherical triangle made up of great-circle arcs
- Verify if there is an angle difference between initial and final directions of parallel-transported tangent vector when following this path on S2.

---

### 14.3: Covariant derivative

**Covariant Derivative and Parallel Transport**
- Covariant derivative: A concept used to compare a vector or tensor field's behavior with parallel transport in different directions from a point p.
- Essential idea: Differences between actual vector behavior and parallel transport can be measured for defining a derivative of a vector field.
- Requirements: Linear dependence on the displacement vector w, compatibility with gradient operator (d) for scalars, additivity, and Leibniz law.
- Operator denoted by ∇ or D, acts linearly on vectors and extends to tensors of general valence.
- Natural requirements: Additivity and tensor Leibniz law.

**Parallel Transport**
- Comparison of vector behavior with standard provided by parallel transport.
- Applicable for finite displacements along a curve γ, but for covariant first derivative, only infinitesimal displacement at p depends on tangent vector w.

**Symbol Notation**
- Lowercase w represents the notion of differentiation (covariant derivative operator).
- Physicist's notation: ∇w = D and mathematician's notation: ∇.
- Awkwardness in notation due to potential confusion between mathematician's and physicist's interpretations of the symbol w.

**Action on Tensors**
- Covariant derivative operator acts on tensors, extending its scope from vectors to general tensors.
- Rules: Additivity for tensors of the same valence, tensor Leibniz law (Leibniz rule in index notation).

**Coordinate Derivative vs Covariant Derivative**
- Coordinate derivative operator ∂/∂xa is used to define a particular connection called coordinate connection within a coordinate patch.
- Not physically interesting due to arbitrary coordinates and disagreement with connections on overlapping patches.
- Useful for explicit expressions as differences between connections can be expressed algebraically using tensor quantity Γabcd.

---

### 14.4: Curvature and torsion

**Curvature and Torsion**

**Coordinate connections**:
- Define a special kind of connection that defines parallelism independent of path
- Due to symmetry property: ∂²f/∂x∂y = ∂²f/∂y∂x
- This allows for path independence of parallelism

**General connections**:
- Do not have the same symmetry property as coordinate connections
- Gives rise to two special tensors: **torsion tensor** (τ) and **curvature tensor** (R)

**Torsion**:
- Present when  [a b] on a scalar quantity does not vanish
- Taken to be torsion-free in most physical theories (i.e., τ = 0)
- However, some theories employ non-zero torsion for significant physical role

**Curvature**:
- Tensor defined as: R[a b]c\_{d}
- Antisymmetric in first pair of indices a, b (Fig. 14.7c)
- Torsion-free case has additional symmetry relation: Bianchi identity (Fig. 14.7d)
- Expresses path dependence of the connection on the local scale
- Transporting a vector around a small loop in space measures how much it changes when returning to starting point

---

### 14.5: Geodesics, parallelograms, and curvature

**Geodesics, Parallelograms, and Curvature**

**Concept of Geodesic**:
- Defined by the connection
- Represents curves of minimum length on curved surfaces
- Equivalent to 'straight lines' in Euclidean geometry
- For a sphere S2: **Geodesics are great circles**
- Significant for Einstein's general relativity, representing the paths of freely falling bodies

**Parallel Transport and Tangent Vectors**:
- Tangent vector `t` is parallel if its direction remains constant along a curve
- Requirement for `t` to be **parallel-transported**: `∇t = 0` along the curve
- Affine parameter `u` is associated with scaling of tangent vectors
- Geodesics are associated with **affine parameters** (measures of distance)

**Constructing Parallelograms from Geodesics**:
- Choose two geodesics, λ and µ, out from a point p
- Measure affine distances along the geodesics to reach points q and r
- To complete the parallelogram:
  - Move off from q along new geodesic `µ′` in direction parallel to `M`
  - Parallel transport `M` from p to q along λ to obtain vector for parallel transport
  - Measure affine distance m = ε along `µ′` to reach the final vertex s or s′
- The difference between s and s′ depends on **torsion** `τ`
- Concerned with how fast these deviations from Euclidean geometry tend to zero as ε gets smaller (order of ε)

---

#### Geodesic Deviation and Curvature Interpretation via Parallelograms in Riemannian Geometry

**Notes on "Order of Smallness" in Riemannian Manifolds**

**Background:**
- Concept of 'order of smallness' is important in Riemannian geometry, independent of coordinate choices
- Intuitively, O(ε3) means much smaller than O(ε2), which itself is much smaller than O(ε)

**Affine Parameters and Parallelograms:**
- Along a curve γ, a field of tangent vectors t is associated with the parameter u
- If γ is a geodesic, an affine parameter is 'evenly spaced' along γ according to t = 0 (parallel-transported)
- Attempting to make a parallelogram using two geodesics λ and µ through p involves transporting their respective tangent vectors L and M at p by parallel transport, resulting in new 'parallel' arrows εL′ and εM′ along the extended geodesics λ′ and µ′
- If torsion τ vanishes, parallelograms close exactly (up to O(ε3))
- When τ is non-zero, there will be an O(ε2) term in the difference between the results of parallel displacement along prs vs pqs paths

**Interpreting Curvature with Parallelograms:**
- If torsion τ vanishes, the difference in transporting a third vector N from p to s via q and r provides a direct geometrical interpretation of the curvature tensor R
- The O(ε2) term measuring this difference is ε² LaMbNc Rabcd
- This expression is sensitive only to the antisymmetric part L [a M b] of LaMb, representing the 2-plane element spanned by L and M at p
- In a 2-surface M, there is one independent curvature component providing the Gaussian curvature of the surface

**Geodesic Deviation:**
- Choosing N = L in the parallelogram interpretation allows for interpreting geodesic deviation as the difference between results of parallel displacement along prs and pqs paths
- The O(ε2) term measuring this deviation, ε² LaMb Lc Rabc d, measures the 'relative acceleration' or 'geodesic deviation' of a nearby geodesic γ′ away from a given geodesic γ starting parallel to each other at p
- Positive curvature results in neighbouring geodesics bending towards each other, while negative curvature causes them to bend apart.

### 14.6: Lie derivative

**Lie Derivative**

**Definition**:
- Lie derivative is an operation taken with respect to a vector field ξ on a smooth manifold M
- Measures how a quantity Q (e.g., vector, tensor) changes as compared to being 'dragged' by the vector field ξ

**Properties of Lie Derivative**:
- Satisfies three laws:
  - **Commutation**: [ξ, η] = –[η, ξ]
  - **Additivity**: [ξ, η + ζ] = [ξ, η] + [ξ, ζ]
  - **Associativity**: [ξ, [η, ζ]] + [η, [ζ, ξ]] + [ζ, [ξ, η]] = 0

**Relation to Lie Algebra**:
- Lie derivative of a vector field η with respect to another vector field ξ is the same as the Lie bracket [ξ, η] introduced in §13.6
- In the context of Lie groups, the infinitesimal elements are vector fields on the group manifold G or H, representing pre-multiplication by an infinitesimal group element ξ (Lie algebra element)
- To first order, product of two infinitesimal motions ξ and η just gives their sum, revealing only the additive structure of the tangent space at the identity element
- To obtain the group structure, we need to look at the commutator [ξ, η] = ξη – ηξ, which provides information about the 'gap' in the parallelogram with alternate sides εξ and εη at the origin I

---

#### Lie Derivative and Exponentiation in Group Action

**Lie Derivative and Parallelism**

**Group Action**:
- Relevant notion of 'parallelism' comes from group action, providing 'parallel transport' without curvature
- Procedure for obtaining finite group element x from Lie algebra element ξ: **Exponentiation** (cf. §5.3, §13.4)

**Lie Derivative**:
- Definition of Lie derivative with respect to ξ on a vector field η: **[ξ, η]**
- Lie derivative rules for tensors of the same valence:
  - Scalar Φ: Φ = ξ(Φ)
  - T + U: T + U = T + U
  - T•U: (T•U) = (T)•U + T•U
- Lie derivative of a covector a: **[ξ, α]** (Fig. 14.17b)
- Lie derivative of a general tensor Q: **[ξ, Q]** (Fig. 14.17c)
- Connection-independent property: same expression regardless of the choice of torsion-free operator ∇

**Curvature**:
- Need the Lie bracket for defining the curvature tensor in mathematician's notation: **R(L, M, N)**
- Torsion term allows for an 'O(ε²)' gap in the O(ε) quadrilateral built from vector fields L and M (Fig. 14.19)

---

### 14.7: What a metric can do for you

**Riemannian Metrics and Connections**

**What a Metric Can Do for You**
- Assigns structure to a manifold M
- Provides secondary structure as a metric or pseudometric g
- Smooth tensor field that applies to tangent spaces at various points on M
- Manifold with assigned metric is called Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian

**Properties of Metrics**
- Positive definite metrics provide measure of distance between points A and B (length of a curve) via integral of ds along the curve
  - Length ℓ = ∫ds, where ds² = gab dxa dxb
  - Integration of ds is legitimate for defining length when g is positive-definite
  - Equivalent to Pythagorean theorem at infinitesimal level

**Geodesics and Connections**
- Connection Γ (Christoffel symbols) uniquely determined by a non-singular metric g and vanishing torsion
  - Parallel transport of a vector preserves its length (geodesic property)
  - Equivalently, geodesics minimize ∫ds between two points

**Riemann Tensors**
- Defined from the metric gab and its inverse gab
- Possess symmetries like antisymmetry in ab and cd, symmetry under interchange of ab with cd
- Only n²−1 components are independent due to symmetries

**Killing Vectors**
- Vector field that annihilates the metric when Lie differentiated with respect to it (κa · b = 0)
- Generator of a continuous symmetry on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold M
- If M contains more than one independent Killing vector, their commutator is another Killing vector.

**Exercises**
- Derive explicit component expressions for connection quantities Γ (Christoffel symbols)
- Establish the classical expression for the curvature tensor in terms of Christoffel symbols
- Supply details for the argument provided
- Derive antisymmetry in cd from the equation Γabcd = 0 and use it to obtain interchange symmetry
- Verify that symmetries allow only 20 independent components when n = 4.

### 14.8: Symplectic manifolds

**Symplectic Manifolds**

**Definition**: Symplectic manifolds are smooth, 2m-dimensional real manifolds equipped with an antisymmetric and non-singular tensor field S. The components of S satisfy the following conditions:

- **Closure condition**: dS = 0
- The inverse Sab defines the **Poisson bracket**, which combines two scalar fields Φ and Ψ on a phase space to provide a third: {Φ, Ψ} = –{Ψ, Φ}. This encodes Hamilton's equations.
- **Symplectic algebra**: {Φ, {Φ, Ψ}} + {Ψ, {Ψ, Φ}} + {Φ, {Ψ, Θ}} = 0

**Properties**:
- No notion of curvature for symplectic manifolds, so they are locally identical (up to a change of coordinates)
- Unlike Riemannian manifolds or manifolds with connections, the curvature tensor and its derivatives do not distinguish one symplectic manifold from another
- Symplectic structures are examples of "floppy" structures that cannot be distinguished locally based on some physical feature

**Comparison with Lie Brackets**: The Poisson bracket can be compared to the Lie bracket of vector fields (§14.6).

**Derivation and Verification**: Provide proofs, calculations, and explanations for the given equations and statements.

**Floppy Structures**: Symplectic manifolds are an example of "floppy" structures, which include:
- Complex structure on a real manifold (§12.9)
- Real manifold with a nowhere vanishing vector field

**Importance for Twistor Theory**: The issue of floppiness has implications for twistor theory.

**Notes**:
- There is no way to assign a "parallel" to υ on S² in a continuous manner (Section 14.2, note).
- In mathematics literature, the coordinate derivative ∂/∂xa is sometimes indicated by appending a lower index a to the quantity being differentiated (Section 14.3, note).
- The **index staggering** needed when a metric is introduced (Section 14.7)
- Strictly, ∇a acts on fields defined on M, not just along curves within M (Section 14.5, note).

---

#### Pseudo-Riemannian Geometry: Locality and Exponentiation

**Extending the Definition Region**
- If we wish, consider extending definition of t smoothly from γ into M
- Relevant only along γ for holding equation on t
- Prescribing way is irrelevant

**Lie Algebra of Commutators in Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff Formula**
- Explicit role of Lie algebra of commutators
- Given the first few terms explicitly as e ξ e η = ..., where dots stand for further expressions in multiple commutators of ξ and η
- Element of Lie algebra generated by ξ and η

**Coordinates Along Curve**
- Choose coordinates x2, x3, …, xn constant along curve, with x1 = t
- ξ = ∂/∂t
- Taylor's theorem used to obtain e^(tξ) (Φ)

**Exponentiation of Tensors**
- Corresponding expression for tensor Q a finite distance away, as measured against a 'dragged' reference frame

**Terminology: Pseudo-Riemannian vs. Semi-Riemannian**
- Some books use 'semi-Riemannian' for indefinite case (see O'Neill 1983)
- More appropriate to call it pseudo-Riemannian

**Parameter u Along Curve**
- Common way to give meaning to ds/du expression
- Quantity ds/du is an ordinary function of u, expressed in terms of dx_a/du

**Locality Concept**
- For each point p in M, there's an exponentiation that maps open set containing p into another with identical metric structure (see §14.6)

**Identical Metric Structures**
- Refer to the fact that each can be mapped to other, preserving symplectic structures.

## 15. Fibre bundles and gauge connections 
###  15.1: Some physical motivations for fibre bundles

**Fibre Bundles and Gauge Connections (Chapter 15)**

**Motivations for Fibre Bundles:**
- Modern particle interaction theory requires a generalization of connection called gauge connection
- Based on the parallel transport concept introduced in Chapters 12 and 14
- Gauge connections refer to 'parallel transport' of specific physical quantities, not limited to tangent spaces at points in M

**Gauge Connections vs. Tensors:**
- Tensors are quantities related to tangent spaces at points in M
- Gauge connections are different from these and need the notion of a bundle

**Bundles:**
- Precise mathematical concept introduced for pure mathematics before physicists adopted it
- Used extensively by theoretical physicists in modern gauge theories
- Incorporate geometric concepts related to 'internal dimensions' not directly linked with ordinary space and time

**Kaluza–Klein Idea:**
- Extension of Einstein's general relativity with a 5th spatial dimension
- Allows for incorporation of electromagnetism in a certain sense
- Analogy: hosepipe as a 1-dimensional universe with 2-dimensional surface (internal dimensions)
- Speculative idea, not directly applicable to current gauge theories

**Fibre Bundles:**
- Central concept in modern gauge theories of particle interactions
- Imagine 'above' each point in spacetime is another space called a fibre
- Fibres consist of all internal dimensions for specific physical interpretations.

---

### 15.2: The mathematical idea of a bundle

**The Mathematical Concept of a Bundle**

**Definition:**
- A bundle (or fibre bundle) **B** consists of a manifold with some structure defined in terms of two other manifolds:
  - The base space **M** (spacetime itself, in most physical applications)
  - The fibre space **V** (the internal space, in most physical applications)
- **B** is made up of a whole family of fibres **V**, constituted as an "M's worth of V's"

**Simple vs. Twisted Bundles:**
- A product space (trivial or untwisted bundle) **M ×V** is a trivial bundle over **M**, where the points of **M ×V** are pairs of elements from **M** and **V**.
- More interesting are the twisted bundles, where the fibres may twist around, resulting in a non-trivial **B** that is different from **M ×V**.

**Group of Symmetries:**
- The group **G** of symmetries of **V** is called the group of the bundle **B**. This allows for twisting and makes the bundle concept interesting.
- In many situations, **V** is taken to be a vector space, resulting in a vector bundle.

**Relation Between M and B:**
- **M** is not part of **B**, but rather viewed as standing above the base space.
- There are multiple copies of **V** in **B**, with each copy standing above a point in **M**. The fibres are disjoint and make up the entire bundle.
- The canonical projection from **B** to **M** collapses each entire fibre down to the corresponding point in **M**.

---

### 15.3: Cross-sections of bundles

**Cross-Sections of Bundles**

**Characterizing Differences Between Cylinder and Möbius Bundle:**
- **Cross-section**: A continuous image of a base space (M) in a bundle (B), intersecting each individual fiber at a single point.
- **Lift of the base space**: A 'lift' of M into the bundle B that meets each fiber once. Applying this lift and the canonical projection results in the identity map on M.

**Cylinder Bundle (Product Space)**:
- Cross-sections: Continuous functions assigning points in V to points in M, like the graph of a function.
- Zero section: Represents zeros of vector spaces V by assigning real-number coordinates along fibers and tracing out zero section.
- Non-vanishing functions: Cross-sections that do not intersect the zero section (Fig. 15.7a).

**Möbius Bundle**:
- Every cross-section must intersect the zero section (Fig. 15.7b).
- Cross-section corresponds to a real-valued function on the circle that changes sign when circumnavigating the circle.

**Distinguishing Bundles Using Cross-Sections:**
- Examining families of cross-sections can be helpful in distinguishing various bundles over the same base space M.
- The difference between Möbius bundle and cylinder is less extreme than some other examples.
- In certain cases, a bundle may have no cross-sections at all (Fig. 15.8).

**Important Example: No Cross-Sections**
- To be explored in the next section.

---

### 15.4: The Clifford-Hopf bundle

**Clifford–Hopf Bundle**

**Base Space M**:
- 2-dimensional sphere S²

**Bundle Manifold B**:
- 3-sphere S³
- Circles S¹ (1-spheres) as fibers V = S¹

**Fibration**:
- Family of complex straight lines Aw + Bz = 0 in ℂ²
- Each line meets the unit sphere S³ at a circle S¹
- Fibers are given by the ratio A:B
- Base space M is the Riemann sphere S²

**Bundle Structure**:
- No two distinct fibers have points in common
- Identify base space with the space of such ratios (A:B)
- Can view S³ as an S¹ bundle over S²

**Clifford Parallels**:
- Family of circles that are great circles on S³
- Remain the same distance apart, twist around each other
- Compensation between geodesic deviation and skew lines
- Projected to Euclidean 3-space as stereographically, showing family of projected Clifford circles

**Lack of Cross-Sections**:
- Circles are only modelled on the unit circle in ℂ, not identified with it
- Non-existence of cross-sections due to rotational symmetry (O(2) or U(1)) of fibers

---

#### Clifford Parallels in S3 and Spinorial Tangent Vectors on S2

**The Existence of Global Continuous Fields of Unit Tangent Vectors**
- In Euclidean 3-space, skew straight lines get increasingly distant from each other as they go off.
- However, in S3 (the 3-sphere), the positive curvature provides a compensating tendency to bend geodesics towards each other by geodesic deviation (Fig. 15.9).

**The Clifford Bundle and Its Modification**
- The Clifford bundle B represents a continuous field of unit tangent vectors on M = S2, which is not globally defined due to the topological fact that there's no global continuous field of ordinary unit tangent vectors on S2.
- To obtain the actual bundle B′ of unit tangent vectors to S2, we must identify antipodal points on S3 (Fig. 15.10).
- Each point in B′ represents a point on S2 with a unit tangent vector at that point.
- The fibers of B′ are circles, and each circle-fibre of B wraps twice around each circle-fibre of B′.
- Topologically, the space B′ is identical to R3, which represents different spatial orientations in Euclidean 3-space (as discussed in §12.1).

**Proof that Identifying Antipodal Points Yields the Actual Bundle B′**
- To obtain B′ from B: identify antipodal points on S3, so two points must be identified to represent a single point in B′.
- This means that any ordinary unit tangent vector has only one manifestation as a spinorial object instead of two (negative of each other).
- Carry out this argument for S15 and prove it using the given hint: take the tangent vector u ∂/∂v – v ∂/∂u + x ∂/∂y – y ∂/∂x.

---

### 15.5: Complex vector bundles, (co)tangent bundles

**Complex Vector Bundles: The Clifford Bundle (Bℂ) and its Extension**

**Clifford Bundle (Bℂ)**
- Example of a complex vector bundle in which each line Aw + Bz = 0 is a 1-dimensional complex vector space
- Base space M: Riemann sphere S2
- Fibre V: Complex 1-dimensional vector space
- Need to modify ℂ² by replacing origin with entire Riemann sphere (blowing up) to get disjoint fibres
- Holomorphic cross-sections represent spinor fields on S2

**Bundles Derived from Clifford Bundle (Bℂ)**
- **Bundle B′ℂ**: Square of the vector bundle Bℂ
  * Constructed in the same way as Bℂ, but identify each point with its antipodal point
  * Interpreted as tangent bundle T(S2) of S2
- **Tangent Bundle (TM)** and **Cotangent Bundle (T*)**
  * Represent a point of M together with a tangent or cotangent vector at that point
  * Cross-sections: Vector fields on M, covector fields on M
- Importance in physics: Symplectic manifolds used in classical mechanics.

**Further Discussion**
- **Why does every spinor field take the value zero at least one point of S2?** (Open question)
- **Bundle B′ℂ is indeed the same as T(S2):** Re-examine Exercise [15.5] for proof.

---

### 15.6: Projective spaces

**Projective Spaces**

**Definition and Importance:**
- Concept derived from Euclidean geometry
- Lines in a plane appear to intersect at a "vanishing point" on the horizon
- Adjoins "points at infinity" enabling parallel lines to intersect
- Important in mathematics, quantum mechanics, and twistor theory

**History:**
- Originated from perspective in drawing and painting
- Theorems of Pappos (3rd century AD) and Desargues (1636) demonstrated the intersection of parallel lines with the aid of projective geometry

**Construction:**
- Based on an n+1 dimensional vector space Vn+1
- Considered as the space of 1-dimensional subspaces of Vn+1, i.e., lines through origin O
- A straight line in ℙn is given by a 2-dimensional subspace (a plane) through origin O
- Collinear points are lines lying in such a plane
- Higher-dimensional flat subspaces correspond to projective spaces ℙr contained in ℙn.

**Real vs Complex Projective Spaces:**
- Real projective space: constructed using real vector space Vn+1 and considered as the space of lines through origin O in that space
- Complex projective space: similar process but using complex vector space CVn+1 instead.

**Application:**
- Formalizes procedures of perspective in pictorial representation
- Artist's "straight line" corresponds to the plane joining it to the artist's eye (origin O)
- Pairs of planes intersecting at parallel lines in V3, represented as straight lines on a canvas.

---

#### Geometry of Complex Projective Spaces in Quantum Mechanics

**Projective Spaces and Homogeneous Coordinates**

**Perceived Scene:**
- Boundary lines create accurate picture on a flat plane (not through O)
- Multiple planes cover entire ℙ2, capturing parallel lines with common vanishing point in other planes.

**Real Projective Spaces vs Complex Projective Spaces:**
- Real projective spaces: describe ℝ ℙ n for real coordinates
- Complex projective spaces: describe ℂ ℙ n for complex coordinates

**Homogeneous Coordinates:**
- Ratios of n independent z's (not all zero)
- Identify V n+1 with either ℝ n+1 or ℂ n+1.

**Origin Removal:**
- Origin O is excluded from homogeneous coordinates
- Fibre has its origin removed
- Prefer to reinstate origin in fibre, leading to a vector bundle.

**Complex Case:**
- Unit (2n+1)-sphere S2n+1 considered
- Each fibre intersects S2n+1 in a circle S1
- Obtains S2n+1 as an S1 bundle over ℂ ℙ n.

**Application:**
- Underlies geometry of quantum mechanics, where the space of physically distinct quantum states is a ℂ ℙ n.
- Phase is a twisted unit-modulus complex number instead of a simple complex number eiθ (real).

**Hints for Practice Problems:**
- For n+1 sets of ordinary coordinates, cover ℙ n with two coordinate patches at a time.
- Understand the geometry as the composition of bundles over S n and ℝ n+1 – O.

### 15.7: Non-triviality in a bundle connection

**Bundle Notions: Non-triviality and Connection**

**Bundles**:
- Concepts introduced in whirlwind tour, some geometry/topology intricate but important
- Bundle can be non-trivial despite topological triviality

**Example of a bundle:**
- Base space M: an ordinary circle S1
- Fiber V: 1-dimensional real vector space
- Bundles constructed differently this time: given a stretch by a factor of 2 (Fig. 15.16) instead of flipping the fiber as in Möbius bundle
- Topology is not the issue here, it's still just a cylinder S1 × ℝ
- Strain or connection on bundle recognized through this new stretch transformation

**Connection on bundles:**
- Previous connections were concerned with 'parallelism' of tangent vectors (Chapter 14)
- Generalized notion: local constancy for quantities described by the bundle, called a bundle connection
- Differences from previous notions of connection: no association with tangent bundle and more freedom in specifying action on bundles

**Strained Bundle B:**
- Topologically trivial but non-trivial due to this new 'strain' or connection (Fig. 15.16)
- Constancy of a cross-section can be taken as constancy in the ordinary sense of a real-valued function on S1 – p (a topologically trivial region).

#### Gluing Bundles with Relative Stretch Leads to Path-Dependent Constant Transport

**Global vs Local Path Dependence in Bundles**

**Background:**
- Fig. 15.18: Two patches, B p and B q (with q ≠ p), make up a bundle with constant sections represented as horizontal lines
- Gluing involves relative stretching between regions leading to discrepancy when base space S1 is circumnavigated

** Constant Transport:**
- Look for fibre-valued function transported horizontally from one point to another on B
- Path-dependent due to multiple ways to traverse the base space, resulting in different final values at b
- Not the same as tangent bundle connection studied in Chapter 13 (local path dependence)

**Fig. 15.18 Explanation:**
- Part B p stands above a trivial region S1 – p of S1
- Horizontal means horizontal in ordinary sense within each patch, but there's relative stretching between regions during gluing (illustrated as right-hand patching)
- This provides the connection illustrated in Fig. 15.16
- Global path dependence instead of local path dependence seen in Chapter 13

**Global vs Local Path Dependence:**
- In this example, it's shown that global path dependence can occur even when none is present locally.

### 15.8: Bundle curvature

**Bundles Curvature in Complex Plane**

**Modifying Example:**
- Obtain bundle over 2D space, S1 as unit circle in complex plane Mℂ = ℂ
- Fibers remain copies of real line ℝ
- Extend connection to new bundle Bℂ with 'strain' operator ∂/∂z → ∂/∂z - A
- Use global coordinates (z, Φ) for Bℂ
- Cross-section: Φ = Φ(z,  )
- Constant cross-section: Φ = 0 (whence also ∂Φ/∂ = 0)

**Path Dependence with Curvature:**
- At least 2 dimensions required in base space Mℂ for local path dependence
- A non-zero solution obtained when A is non-holomorphic
- Commutator relation between operators causing obstructions to finding locally constant sections

**Curvature Definition:**
- Manifested in failure to close horizontal polygon above small parallelogram in Mℂ
- Imaginary part of ∂A/∂ defines curvature for connection  
- Proportional to area of loop, e.g., unit circle S1

**Comparison with Chapter 14:**
- Commutator relation for operators a and  
- Curvature describes path dependence at infinitesimal level

**Index Notation:**
- Connection operator expressed as Aa µλ
- Bundle curvature: Fij = [Ai, Ak] + [Kij, _] where Fi = Di and Kij are Riemann curvature tensors.

## 16. The ladder of infinity 
###  16.1: Finite fields

**The Ladder of Infinity**

**Finite Fields and the Ancient Greeks**:
- The physical universe is believed to have a fundamental dependence on the infinite
- Ancient Greeks used rational numbers, which are infinite in potential size and refinement
- Some prefer a finite universe with no discreteness at tiny scales
- Approach of considering a finite number system has been pursued by Y. Ahmavaara and colleagues

**Defining Finite Fields**:
- Constructed from integers by reducing them modulo a prime **p**
- Two integers are equivalent if their difference is a multiple of **p**
- Elements fall into **p** "equivalence classes"
- Regarded as the elements of the finite field **𝔽 p**, with exactly **p** elements
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division hold for these elements

**Unusual Property**:
- Summing **p** identical elements results in zero

**Limitations of Finite Fields**:
- Elements are defined as "infinite sets of integers"
- Could simply list operations without appealing to infinite sets

**Examples of Finite Fields**:
- **𝔽 5**: Labeled by **0, 1,2, 3, 4**, with addition and multiplication tables
- **𝔽 4 = 2^2**: Labeled by **0, 1, ω, ω2**, where **ω3 = 1** and each element obeys **x + x = 0**

**General Case**:
- Elements of **𝔽 pm** have sum of **p** elements equal to zero

---

### 16.2: A finite or infinite geometry for physics?

**Finite or Infinite Geometry for Physics?**
- Idea of using finite fields in place of real numbers has been proposed in physics, but it remains unclear if it would play a significant role
- If 𝔽 q were to replace the real number system, p would have to be very large for discrepancies not to show up
- The idea is explored by examining projective n-spaces over finite fields

**Projective Spaces with Finite Total Number of Points**
- Projective planes ℙ2 (𝔽 q) have exactly 1 + q + q2...+ qn different points
- Magic discs can be constructed to represent these projective planes, where every distance can be uniquely represented as a sum of cyclically successive collections of the as
- Examples of magic discs exist for q = 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13, and 16
- Magic discs provide an elegant construction for projective planes and have mathematical significance in proving Pappos' and Desargues' theorems

**Fano Plane**
- A finite projective plane with 7 points called the Fano plane
- Each point is associated with a generating element i0, i1, i2,...i6 of the octonion algebra
- Product of two distinct generating elements can be found by finding the line in the Fano plane joining their points and determining the sign of the product using disc representation or arrow arrangements
- The Fano plane has particular interest as it provides the multiplication law for octonions.

#### Exploring Different Infinities in Mathematics for Physical Understanding

**Mathematics and Physical World Connection**
* Geometric and algebraic structures may not have apparent contact with the physical world
* Platonic mathematical world is vast, only a small part relevant to physical laws
* Mathematical elegance alone insufficient for understanding universe's principles (Cantor's theory of infinities)
* Infinite structures might be part of mathematical formalism, but not intended as direct physical interpretation
* Continuum still features in successful present-day theories
* Discrete ideas play key roles in some theories like loop variables and spin networks
* Taking infinite seriously: understanding role in mathematical description of physical continuum
* Different sizes of infinities (Cantor's theory)

**Georg Cantor and Infinite Sets**
* Georg Cantor: Danish/Russian/German mathematician who showed there are different sizes of infinities
* Discovered infinite sets surpassing rational numbers through theory development between 1874 and 1895

**Exercises:**
1. **Complete addition and multiplication tables for 𝔽 4 and check algebraic laws**
2-5. **Construct new magic discs using angular distances multiplied by fixed integers**
6. **Show associator function antisymmetrical in a, b, c**
7. **Deduce that this holds for all elements (whence also a(ab) = a²b)**

---

### 16.3: Different sizes of infinity

**Cantor's Revolution and Infinite Cardinalities**
- **Key Ingredient**: One-to-one correspondence (1–1) between sets to determine their cardinality
- Two sets have the same cardinality if they can be put into 1–1 correspondence with each other

**Finite vs. Infinite Sets**
- Finite sets: have a finite number of elements
- Infinite sets: have the same cardinality as some of their proper subsets

**Examples of Equal Cardinality in Infinite Sets**
- Natural numbers (ℕ) and its subset without 0 have the same cardinality
- Square numbers and all integers have the same cardinality as natural numbers

**Cardinal Numbers**
- Abstract entities representing the number of elements in a set based on 1–1 correspondence
- Includes finite and infinite cardinals (finite cardinals: natural numbers)

**Relationships Between Cardinal Numbers**
- **Less than or equal to**: If elements can be put into 1–1 correspondence with a subset of another set
- **Non-comparable cardinals**: Nonexistent due to the axiom of choice

**Axiom of Choice and Controversy**
- Assertion that, given a set A containing non-empty sets, there exists a set B containing one element from each set in A
- Alarming consequences, such as the Banach–Tarski theorem

**Cardinal Numbers vs. Ordinal Numbers**
- Cardinal numbers: Represent size of a set based on 1–1 correspondence
- Ordinal numbers: Represents order or position of elements within a set (as in 3.4)

---

#### Demonstration of Rational Numbers' Cardinality Equality through Mapping Integers and Natural Numbers.

**The Axiom of Choice**
- The axiom of choice asserts that:
  - For any set `A`, where all members are non-empty sets, there exists a set `B` with exactly one element from each set in `A`.

**Properties of Cardinal Numbers**
- The symbol "≤" has the normal meaning when applied to natural numbers (finite cardinals).
  - Any natural number is less than or equal to any infinite cardinal number.
- If `β ≤ α`, with an infinite cardinal, then:
  - The cardinality of the union `A ∪ B` is the greater of the two, namely `α`.
  - The cardinality of the product `A × B` is also `α`.
- The cardinality of a set is not necessarily larger than the individual elements.
- The number of rational numbers is the same as the natural numbers (`0`, or "aleph nought").
- Infinite numbers are ordered with `≤`, with `0` being the smallest infinite cardinal.

**Exercises and Proofs**
- Provide an explicit procedure for ordering all fractions to show that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between rational numbers and natural numbers (Exercise [16.7]).
- Show that the function `(a² + 3a + b)² + a²` provides a 1-to-1 correspondence between natural numbers and pairs of natural numbers (Exercise [16.8]).
- Prove this result using a 1-to-1 map `b` from `A` to some subset `bA` of `B`, and a 1-to-1 map `a` from `B` to some subset `aB` of `A`. Combine these maps to create a 1-to-1 correspondence between `A` and `B`.

---

### 16.4: Cantor’s diagonal slash

**Cantor's Diagonal Slash**

**Background:**
- Cantor's demonstration that there are infinites greater than 0
- Cardinality of real numbers (ℝ) has a higher infinity than natural numbers
- Previous achievement: α < 2α, where α < β means α ≤ β and α ≠ β

**Cantor's Notation:**
- BA stands for the set of all mappings from A to B
- Exponential notation is used (BA = ba) when applying this procedure to finite sets
- Cardinality of BA is denoted as βα

**Proof by Contradiction:**
1. Attempt to suppose α = 2α
   - Each element a in A associated with a subset S(a) under the correspondence
   - Consider collection of elements not in their corresponding sets (Q)
   - Two possible outcomes: q is or isn't in Q
      * If it isn't, we have an contradiction since it must belong to Q according to the assumption.
      * If it does, it doesn't belong to its assigned subset S(q), another contradiction.
2. Show that α < 2α (established by a 1–1 correspondence between A and some subset of 2A)
   - Every natural number has an even and odd counterpart, which can be paired off with each other. However, there is no pairing for the set of real numbers as shown through Cantor's diagonal slash proof.
3. Significance:
   * Shows that there are more real numbers than natural numbers
   * No end to the hugeness of possible infinite numbers
   * Implications: Turing machine and Gödel's incompleteness theorem

---

#### Cantor's Diagonal Argument: Demonstrating Infinite Cardinality of Real Numbers

**Cantor's Diagonal Argument and Binary Expansions of Real Numbers**

**Elements of 2ℕ**:
- Elements can be thought of as infinite sequences (e.g., 100110001011101...)
- Assign 0 or 1 to each natural number

**Ambiguity in Binary Expansions**:
- Infinite sequences ending with only 0s or 1s have ambiguity

**Interleaving Binary Digits**:
- Interleave binary digits with a number (e.g., .3130303131...)
- Read as ordinary decimal expression of some real number
- Establishes 1–1 correspondence between 2ℕ and certain subset of ℝ

**Cardinality of the Set**:
- Every real number between 0 and 1 has binary expansion, albeit redundantly
- Simple functions can map this interval to entire ℝ
- Proves that cardinality is at most 2⁵
- C = 2⁵ (since every real number in [0, 1] can be mapped)

**Original Version of the Argument**:
- Also a proof by contradiction
- Envisaged a 1–1 correspondence between ℕ and real numbers between 0 and 1
- Contradiction obtained by constructing a new real number not in the list using diagonal argument.

---

### 16.5: Puzzles in the foundations of mathematics

**Cantor's Set Theory and Its Foundational Implications**

**Cardinality of the Continuum**
- Cantor's notation: C for the cardinality of the continuum (ℝ)
- Unresolved issue: continuum hypothesis (CH), 2 = 1?

**Continuum Hypothesis and Axiom of Choice**
- Famous unresolved issue proposed by Cantor
- K. Gödel and P. Cohen proved its undecidability with standard set theory
- Possibility of resolution through more powerful proof methods or subjective standpoints

**Largest Infinity: No Such Thing as 'Set of All Sets'**
- Russell paradox: paradoxical result from applying Cantor argument to the 'set of all sets'
- No set can contain itself, leading to contradiction
- Implication: no largest cardinal number exists or the 'set of all sets' is not allowed as a concept

**Distinction Between Sets and Classes**
- Collective term for collections of sets: classes
- Only legitimate to consider 'class of all sets' as opposed to 'set of all sets'
- Cantor denoted the supreme class by Ω, attributed an almost deistic significance

**Troubles with Distinction Between Sets and Classes**
- Circular definition: a class is a set if it can be a member of another class
- Delicate and difficult procedure to draw line between allowed and disallowed collections
- Extreme liberalism versus extreme conservatism in mathematical approaches.

---

### 16.6: Turing machines and Gödel’s theorem

**Turing Machines and Gödel's Theorem**

**Computability**:
- A computation (or algorithm) is what an idealized computer would perform
- An idealized computer has no physical limitations, never makes mistakes, and has unlimited storage space
- Mathematically, such an entity is called a **Turing machine**
- Any particular Turing machine corresponds to some specific computation that can be performed on natural numbers

**Faulty vs Effective Turing Machines**:
- A Turing machine is faulty if it fails to terminate when applied to some natural number
- An effective Turing machine always terminates, no matter what natural number it is applied to
- Example of a non-terminating (faulty) Turing machine: one that tries to find the smallest natural number that is not the sum of a given natural number squared

**Encoding Turing Machines**:
- Each separate Turing machine has a "table of instructions" that can be completely specified by some "code"
- This code can be re-interpreted as a natural number **t**, which encodes the program of the machine
- An effective Turing machine provides an answer after a finite time when applied to any individual natural number

**Universal Turing Machine**:
- Turing realized that there is a single **universal Turing machine (UTM)** that can imitate the action of any Turing machine
- The UTM acts first on the natural number **t**, specifying the particular Turing machine to be mimicked, and then upon the number **n**
- Modern general-purpose computers are essentially universal Turing machines

**Deciding Effectiveness of a Turing Machine**:
- It is not possible to find an algorithm for deciding whether a Turing machine is effective or faulty
- Turing applied Cantor's diagonal slash argument to show that the set of natural numbers **t** for which the Turing machine **Tt** is effective cannot be recursive

---

#### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems and Their Implications for Mathematical Formal Systems

**Turing and Cantor Argument**

**Key Points**:
- The set of Turing machines that can decide effective subsets of natural numbers is not recursively enumerable.
- A recursively enumerable subset of natural numbers is a set for which there exists an effective Turing machine that eventually generates each member of the set when applied to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
- Recursive sets are those whose membership is determined by clear computational rules.
- The argument shows that there is no algorithm for determining when a Turing machine action will fail to stop.
- This leads to considering non-recursive sets, which cannot be defined using clear computational rules.
- Gödel's theorem demonstrated that formal systems cannot capture all mathematical truths and that new mathematical truths can be discovered even within trusted formal systems.

**Gödel's Theorem**:
- Shows that any set of rules for mathematical proofs, if trusted to be correct, must include a statement that cannot be proved using those rules alone.
- This result follows from Turing's argument on the recursive enumerability of mathematically provable statements.
- Gödel's theorem allows us to transcend any given formal system and discover new mathematical truths.
- The unproven statements in question are called Π1-sentences.

**Implications**:
- Recursively enumerable sets cannot capture all mathematical truths, leading to the need to consider non-recursive sets and extensions of formal systems.

---

### 16.7: Sizes of infinity in physics

**Physics and Infinities: Size Comparison**

**Background:**
- Remarkable that issues of infinity and constructibility have limited impact on physical theory
- Personal opinion: computability will eventually be relevant to future physical theories*16

**Cardinalities:**
- Almost all of physical theory requires no more than C (cardinality of real number system ℝ) or its equivalent
- Largest found so far is CC = 2C in continuous functions on a manifold
- Continuous functions determined by values on rational coordinates: C
- Generalizations like hyperfunctions have no more than C
- Hilbert spaces used in quantum theory: same size as finite-dimensional spaces, with C continuous functions
- Limit for going beyond this is path integral formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), still only C

**Cardinality vs. Size:**
- Distinction between size of a vector space or manifold and its dimensions
- Infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces: simplest one has ∞0 points, referred to as "∞∞" points
- Freedom in fields: ∞k∞n where n is the number of dimensions and k components per field

**Restrictions on Fields:**
- When fully determined by initial data, they are said to be completely specified on a lower-dimensional space S with q dimensions.

---

#### Exploring the Freedom of Fields and Number Systems in Mathematics

**Section 16.2: Freedom in Fields and Magic Discs**

**Freedom in Fields**
- If data can be expressed freely without constraints, they have infinite freedom (r∞q)
- Important that r and q are invariant quantities

**Magic Discs**
- Modern mathematical term for a set isomorphism between two sets or structures
- Unknown if magic discs exist for all prime powers n ≠ q^2 + q + 1
- Physical role of octonions proposed, but fundamental difficulties in constructing a "quaternionic quantum mechanics"
- P-adic numbers, another number system suggested for significant physical role
  - Expressed like decimally expanded real numbers with digits representing 0, 1, 2, ..., p-1 and allowed to be infinite opposite way from ordinary decimals
  - Rules for addition and multiplication are the same as for "ordinary" p-ary arithmetic

**Section 16.3: Set Isomorphism and Modern Mathematical Terminology**
- A set isomorphism is a mapping between one set or structure to another that preserves certain properties (like composition, identity)

**Section 16.5: Natural Numbers and Zero**
- Modern mathematical notation: ℕ denotes the set of natural numbers (including zero)
  - Alternative notation: ℕ - {0} = {1, 2, 3, ...}
  - Adopting procedures of §3.4 with {0} = 1 leads to confusing "ℕ - 1" for the set under consideration

**Section 16.7: Generalized Continuum Hypothesis and Axiom of Choice**
- Similar remarks apply to Cantor's generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice

**Section 16.6: Early Precursors in Mathematics and Logic**
- Alonzo Church, Haskell B. Curry, Stephen Kleene, Kurt Gödel, Emil Post were early precursors to Turing in mathematics and logic

**Section 16.8-16.9: Foundations of Mathematics**
- References on the foundations of mathematics: Abian (1965), Wilder (1965)
- General references for the foundations of mathematics: Gandy (1988)

**Section 16.10-16.12: Early Precursors in Computer Science and Turing Machines**
- Early precursors in computer science were Alonzo Church, Haskell B. Curry, Stephen Kleene, Kurt Gödel, and Emil Post
- Detailed description of a Turing machine given by Penrose (1989) or Davis (1978), among others

**Section 16.13: Roger Penrose's Work on Gravity and Quantum Mechanics**
- Roger Penrose's work on gravity and quantum mechanics
- Wheeler notation refined to express fields that depend on specific functions of variables and constants (e.g., ∞ p(∞))

---

## 17. Spacetime 
###  17.1: The spacetime of Aristotelian physics

**The Spacetime of Aristotelian Physics**

**Background:**
- Attention shifts from mathematical considerations to physical phenomena
- Understanding spacetime's role in the universe
- Originates with Aristotle and his contemporaries
- Notion of Euclidean space for representing physical space (𝔼 3)
  - Points remain identical over time due to preferred state of rest
  - No preferred origin
- Representation of time as a Euclidean space, but without a preferred origin or element

**Aristotelian Spacetime:**
- Product space of pairs (t, x), where t is an element of 𝔼 1 and x is an element of 𝔼 3
- Appropriate for representing distances between events in space and time difference.

**Characteristics:**
- Clear notion of spatial separation (distance between points)
- Well-defined notion of time interval (separation between t and t′)
- Distinction between same place vs. same time
  - Events at the same place: no spatial displacement
  - Events at the same time: absolute notion of temporal simultaneity.

**Implications:**
- Appropriate to think of spacetime as Aristotelian spacetime in this scheme
- Clear understanding of events' spatial separation and time difference.

---

### 17.2: Spacetime for Galilean relativity

**Galilean Relativity and Spacetime**

**Notion of spacetime for Galilean relativity**
- Incorporate principle of Galilean relativity into spacetime picture
- Recall Galileo's statement on uniform motion (1638)
  * No dynamical meaning to a point in space being the same at different times
  * Cannot identify a fixed background space
  * Rotation of Earth: point moves significantly with time due to Earth's movement and other celestial bodies' influences

**Implications of Galileo's teaching**
- No absolute rest or motion
- Different Euclidean 3-spaces for each moment in time (no natural identification)
- Mathematics of fibre bundles come to rescue: Galilean spacetime as a fibre bundle with base space 𝔼 1 and fibre 𝔼 3.

**Galilean Spacetime: Fibre Bundle**
- Not a product space 𝔼 1 × 𝔼 3
- Each event assigned a time via the canonical projection to base space 𝔼 1
- No natural identification between different fibres (no absolute space)
- Particle histories are cross-sections of the bundle, with inertial particle motions being depicted as 'straight' world lines.

---

### 17.3: Newtonian dynamics in spacetime terms

**Newtonian Dynamics in Spacetime Terms**

**Galilean Relativist Approach:**
- Newton initially favored Galilean relativism, stated as a fundamental law
- Later simplified to three laws: inertia, force, and superposition
- Introduced concept of "absolute space" for precision

**Galilean Bundle Structure:**
- Not strong enough for bundle connection
- Must provide affine structure encoding straightness of world lines
- World lines represent particle motion as curves (world line) in Galilean bundle G
- Uniform and inertial motions: straight lines within individual 𝔼 3 fibers

**Affine Space Structure:**
- Interprets uniform and inertial motion as "straight" in spacetime terms
- Galilean bundle G is an affine space with agreeing Euclidean structure on each 𝔼 3 fiber

**Connection Definition:**
- Provides a satisfactory framework for generalizations needed in §§17.5,9
- Allows for geodesics definition and Newton's inertial motions
- Curvature of world line measures acceleration, according to Newton's second law

**Force Calculations:**
- Total force on a particle: vector sum of contributions from all other particles (Newton's second law)
- Force between two particles: acts in the line joining them within a particular 𝔼 3, equal and opposite according to Newton's third law.

**Force Law:**
- Each force type has its specific function of spatial distance and overall scale parameters for each particle type.

**Gravity Force Formula:**
- Attractive force between masses m and M at a distance r: F = G * (m * M) / r^2

**Impressive Achievements:**
- Theories accurate to something like one part in 10^7, impressively achieving great accuracy for macroscopic bodies and submicroscopic particles so long as their speeds are significantly less than the speed of light.

---

### 17.4: The principle of equivalence

**Newton's Theory vs. General Relativity:**
- Newton's theory is not absolutely precise, but remains unchallenged for over two centuries
- Einstein's perspective on gravity as a geometric phenomenon led to the development of general relativity
- Galileo's principle of equivalence is an essential concept in understanding this transition

**Galileo's Experiment:**
- Galileo allegedly dropped two rocks of different sizes from Pisa Tower, observing they fell at the same rate (ignoring air resistance)
- Distinction between gravitational mass and inertial mass: both proportional to object's mass
- Equality or proportionality of these masses is a unique feature of gravity
- Electric field example: opposite charges experience opposing forces, unlike gravity

**Principle of Equivalence:**
- Gravitational field is equivalent to an acceleration
- Effect observed in air travel when accelerated motion and gravitational force cannot be distinguished
- Equivalence refers to the fact that a uniform gravitational field feels like an acceleration
- Galileo's experiment illustrates this principle, with insect observing another object 'hover' in a gravity-free environment before impact.

---

#### Einstein's Theory of Equivalence: Inertial Motion as Free Falling

**Equivalence Principle and Inertial Motions**

**Implications of Equivalence Principle:**
- Gravity can be cancelled by acceleration (use of principle of equivalence)
- Passive gravitational mass equals inertial mass
- Distinction between inertial motions is no longer based on zero total external forces

**Inertial Motions according to Einstein:**
- Particles execute inertial motions when total non-gravitational forces are zero
- Free fall with the gravitational field (effective gravitational force reduced to zero)

**Comparison with Newton:**
- In Newton's scheme, 'the state of rest' counts as inertial
- According to Einstein, someone standing still on the ground is not executing an inertial motion because they are not free falling

**Insect and Astronaut Examples:**
- Insect clinging to rock: gravitational field appears absent (Fig. 17.6a)
- Freely orbiting astronaut has gravity-free experience (Fig. 17.6b)

---

### 17.5: Cartan’s ‘Newtonian spacetime’

**Cartan's 'Newtonian spacetime'**
- Incorporating Einstein's notion of an 'inertial motion' into the structure of spacetime
- Reformulation of Newton's gravitational theory according to Einstein's perspective
- Does not represent a change in Newton's theory, but provides a different description
- Proposed by the mathematician Élie Cartan six years after Einstein's revolutionary viewpoint
- **Newtonian spacetime N**: bundle with base space 𝔼 1 and fibre 𝔼 3
- Structure is different from Galilean one due to a family of 'straight' world lines representing inertial motions
- Exception: constant gravitational field where the structure is equivalent to that of G
- Spacetime N possesses a connection, with geodesics as 'straight' world lines of free fall under gravity
- Connection is torsion-free but generally has curvature, making some gravitational fields different from absence of field

**Physical meaning of curvature**
- Astronaut Albert falling freely in space, surrounded by a sphere of particles initially at rest
- Particles horizontally displaced accelerate inward, those vertically displaced accelerate outward due to finite distance to Earth's center
- Distortion of sphere into an ellipsoid with volume equal to the initial sphere's volume, a characteristic property of inverse square law of Newtonian gravity

---

#### Exploring Tidal Effects of Gravity in Spacetime

**Tidal Effect**

**Astronaut A and Nearby Particles**
- Astronaut A (Albert) surrounded by sphere of nearby particles initially at rest with respect to A
- Particles have an acceleration towards Earth's center, varying slightly in direction and magnitude
- Relative acceleration of particles is slightly inward for horizontal displacement and outward for vertical displacement
- Sphere becomes distorted into a prolate ellipsoid of revolution

**A at Earth's Center**
- Move A to Earth's center, sphere of particles surrounds E just above the atmosphere
- Acceleration is inward all around the sphere with an initial volume reduction acceleration 4πGM (total mass surrounded)

**Spacetime Picture**
- Distortion arises from geodesic deviation of neighboring geodesics to A's world line
- Geodesic deviation measures spacetime curvature R
- Tidal effect is a manifestation of spacetime curvature, similar to ocean tides caused by Moon or Sun's non-uniform gravitational field

**Volume Reduction vs. Distortion**
- In empty space: only distortion with no initial volume reduction
- When sphere surrounds matter: both effects present, initial volume reduction proportional to total mass M (4πGM)

**Newtonian Terminology**
- Tidal effect is a term for the direct physical manifestation of spacetime curvature

**Cartan's Formulation**
- Cartan reformulated Newton's gravitational theory using mathematical conditions on connection R, providing a precise expression of volume reduction and distortion requirements.

### 17.6: The fixed finite speed of light

**Einstein's Theory of General Relativity: The Fixed Finite Speed of Light**

**Galileo's Early Expectations**
- Clear expectation that light has finite speed (1638)
- Attempted to measure it using lantern flashes between distant hills, but method was crude

**Role of Electromagnetism in Atoms and Chemistry**
- Forces binding matter together are electromagnetic in origin
- Theory of electromagnetism describes both light and electromagnetic forces

**Conundrum: Relativity Principle vs. Fixed Speed of Light**
- Common sense suggests that different observers measure different speeds of light based on their motion
- Relativity principle demands identical physical laws for all observers, including those moving at high speeds

**Resolution: Lorentz, Poincaré, and Einstein's Viewpoint**
- Absolute speed of light conflicts with relativity principle in Maxwell's theory
- Newtonian picture of light behaving like particles could resolve this issue but is increasingly outdated due to conflicting observations
- Maxwell's wave theory of light gained strength through compelling mathematical scheme and powerful support from observation

**Implications for the Relativity Principle**
- In a theory, such as Newton's, where light behaves like particles, relativity principle can still be upheld
- However, observations show that light's speed is independent of its source, which conflicts with the wave nature of Maxwell's theory
- Lorentz, Poincaré, and later Einstein resolved this issue by proposing a new viewpoint where physical laws appear the same for all observers regardless of their motion.

### 17.7: Light cones

**Light Cones and Spacetime**

**Background:**
- In Minkowski spacetime, light cones specify the fundamental speed of light
- Family of world lines through an event p represents photon histories (wavefronts or bi-characteristics)
  - Light cone at p: a sphere in spatial terms, expanding outwards from p; in spacetime, a local structure in tangent space Tp at p
    - Past and future cones: represent history of imploding and exploding light rays passing through event p, respectively
- To take the speed of light as fundamental is to consider the light cone (null cone) as a structure in spacetime or tangent space

**Characteristics of Light Cones:**
- Spherical shape: described by a quadratic equation in tangent space Tp at p
  - Equation takes form v²g = 0, where g is the index form of symmetric [ ]-tensor g of Lorentzian signature
    * This equation defines the null cone at p
- Light cones have two parts: past and future cones
  - Past cone represents history of imploding light on p
  - Future cone refers to originating light at event p

**Properties of Null Cones:**
- Vectors in a null cone (null vectors) have zero length with respect to metric g
  * This is why they are called 'null' cones
- Multiplying g by any non-zero real number results in the same null cone at p

**Constancy of Speed of Light:**
- Regard light cones at different events as parallel to maintain constant speed of light
  - Speed refers to slope in spacetime terms, so this leads to a uniform arrangement of null cones in flat Minkowski space

**Important Points:**
- Light cone and null cone are interchangeable terms used to describe the same structure in tangent space at an event p that defines the fundamental speed of light.

### 17.8: The abandonment of absolute time

**The Abandonment of Absolute Time in Special Relativity**

**Introduction:**
- Discussion about including absolute time in spacetime G
- Introduced the notion of orthogonality with g determining a preferred time direction
- Resulted in loss of relativity principle

**Arguments Against Absolute Time:**
1. Conflict arises only if we try to retain absolute time concept
2. Acceptance that both space and time are not absolute concepts
3. Abandonment of absolute space had already been recognized as necessary (despite common belief)
4. Preferred state of rest based on extraordinary light speed compared to everyday speeds

**Units in Special Relativity:**
- Common practice to use units for which c = 1, such as seconds or meters
- Adjustments made according to time and distance measures chosen
- Minkowski's viewpoint: spacetime union of space and time

**Fixing Scaling of g:**
- Defines Minkowskian spacetime
- Timelike curves have tangents within null cones, measuring actual time τ for ideal clocks
- Lightlike world lines have zero time interval for photons

**Null Cones and Causality Structure:**
1. Determine causality properties of spacetime
2. No physical particle can travel faster than the speed of light, constrained within or on light cones
3. Future (past) region consists of events that can send (receive) signals from p
4. Symmetry group has the same level of symmetry as Galilean physics, with equal footing for all points and velocities in spacetime.

**Minkowski's Contribution:**
- Introduced fundamental viewpoint: spacetime union of space and time (1908)
- Provided revolutionary perspective to complete special relativity theory

**Overview:**
- Application of generalization to Minkowski's spacetime 𝕄 in Einstein's theory of General Relativity
- Irregular arrangement of null cones compared to uniform one in Galilean space G and Newtonian spacetime N
- Lorentzian pseudo-metric g defines physical measure of time
- Timelike geodesics determine inertial motions

- Extreme situations: closed timelike curves, 'causality violation'
  - Closed timelike curves allow future signals to travel into the past
  - Normally ruled out as unphysical but some physicists take a relaxed view
- Less extreme exotic causality structures in black hole spacetimes

**Connection between g and Inertial Motions:**
- Determines unique torsion-free connection 𝜗
- Timelike geodesics are the curves that maximize proper time (length along world line)
- Fixed by being the curves that locally minimize energy expended to traverse a given length

**Lorentzian Geometry:**
- Explored in next chapter
- Natural encoding of 'volume-reducing rate' 4πGM into Einstein's structure
- Power, beauty, and accuracy of revolutionary theory unveiled.

## 18. Minkowskian geometry 
###  18.1: Euclidean and Minkowskian 4-space

**Minkowskian Geometry**

**Euclidean vs Minkowskian 4-space**:
- Euclidean 2D and 3D geometries are familiar
- Extension to 4D Euclidean space is possible, though visualization is limited
- **Minkowski space 𝕄** has similarities to 𝔼 4, but differences

**Algebraic Treatment of Minkowski Space**:
- Coordinate treatment of 𝔼 4 is close to "ordinary" 3D space
- The **Minkowskian distance s2** between points (w, x, y, z) and (w', x', y', z') is given by Pythagorean relation
- If we consider points as infinitesimally displaced, we can write dx = dw, etc.
- This leads to **ds2** = dw2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2

**Comparison of Metrics**:
- The **dℓ2** metric is similar to the **ds2** of Euclidean space
- However, the **ds2** metric is more directly physical, as it is positive along timelike curves (worldlines of massive particles)
- It is positive for spacelike displacements (not on/within future or past null cones)
- For photons, the time experienced is always zero, even if they travel far

**Complex Coordinates and Complex Metrics**:
- Early attempts to emphasize similarities between Minkowski and Euclidean spaces involved taking the time coordinate t to be purely imaginary
- A more natural approach is to allow all coordinates to be complex
- This leads to a flat, vanishing curvature complex metric **ℂg** on the complexified Minkowski space 𝕄 4

---

### 18.2: The symmetry groups of Minkowski space

**Minkowski Space Symmetry Groups**

**Group of Symmetries of Minkowski Spacetime (ℂ𝔼4):**
- **10-dimensional:**
  * 6-dimensional rotation group O(4) for fixed origin
  * 4-dimensional symmetry group of translations of the origin
- When complexified, the complexified metric is preserved by all continuous motions
- Transitive on spacetime, allowing any point to be sent to any other by some element of the group

**Lorentz Group (O(3,1) or O(1,3)):**
- **6-dimensional:**
  * General way to see this: examine Lie algebra and check for required sign changes
- Translational part is still 4-dimensional, ensuring transitivity on spacetime

**Poincaré Group:**
- Full symmetry group of Minkowski space 𝕄
- Important in relativistic physics, particularly particle physics and quantum field theory
- Individual particles correspond to representations of the Poincaré group based on mass and spin
- Relativity principle holds due to transitive nature of translation subgroup and complete spatial rotational symmetry

**Relativity Principle:**
- Asserts that the Poincaré group acts transitively on the bundle of future-timelike directions in spacetime
- Every point is on an equal footing, with freedom to move from one velocity to another while preserving symmetry.

---

### 18.3: Lorentzian orthogonality

**Lorentzian Orthogonality and the 'Clock Paradox'**

**Real Section of Complex Space**:
- Regards 𝕄 as a 'real section' or 'slice' of the complex space ℂ 𝔼 4 (or ℂ 𝔼 4  )
- Has a different character than 𝔼 4 itself
- Convenient viewpoint, especially in Euclidean 𝔼 4

**Orthogonality in Complex Space**:
- In ℂ 𝔼 4, a direction can be orthogonal to itself
- This feature persists when passing back to the Lorentzian 𝕄 section
- Retains notion of orthogonality in 𝕄
- Finds real directions that are orthogonal to themselves: null directions along photon world-lines

**Orthogonal Complement**:
- Can consider the orthogonal complement η 
  ┴ of an r-plane element η 
   at a point p
- Represents the family of 'purely spatial' directions at p for an observer

**Changes in Orthogonality with Observer Velocity**:
- In Euclidean geometry, the orthogonal complement changes when direction changes
- Similarly in Lorentzian geometry, but the change tilts the orthogonal complement opposite
- Possible for the orthogonal complement of a null direction to contain that direction

**Changes with Inequalities**:
- Contains the essence of the 'clock paradox' or 'twin paradox' in special relativity
- Accepting the passage of time as an 'arc length' measured along a world line solves this paradox

#### Exploring Special Relativity's Time Dilation Effect via Triangle Inequality in Lorentzian Geometry

**Triangle Inequality in Lorentzian Geometry**

**The Triangle Inequality**:
- In Euclidean geometry, if ABC is a triangle, then AB + BC >= AC, with equality only when A, B, C are collinear.
- In Lorentzian geometry:
  - The sides must be timelike and directed into the future.
  - The inequality reverses: AB + BC <= AC, with equality when A, B, C are collinear.
- Interpretation: The space traveler's world line (ABC) is shorter than the Earth's world line (AC).

**Handling Acceleration**:
- Idealization: Astronaut subjected to impulsive acceleration at event B, which can be addressed by smoothing the corners of the triangle.
- The time difference is not greatly affected, as shown in Fig 18.6c for the Euclidean case.
- Formula ∫ds (with ds > 0) is used to obtain the clock times in both theories.
- Astronaut allowed to accelerate in special relativity, just as in general relativity.
- The distinction lies in the actual metric gij used to evaluate the quantity ds; it depends on whether gravitational fields are neglected (special relativity) or taken into account (general relativity).

**Poincaré Group Actions**:
1. **Poincaré group action**: Explained more fully in the text.
2. **Circumstances for normal vector η to contain its orthogonal complement η'**: Not addressed in the provided text.
3. **Distinct families of self-dual and anti-self-dual complex 2-planes in Cℝ4**:
   - These 2-planes will have importance later, particularly in Section 32.2 and 33.11.
   - Neither family survives in 𝕄Minkowski spacetime as they are not compatible with the timelike structure of the metric.

### 18.4: Hyperbolic geometry in Minkowski space

**Minkowski Space and Hyperbolic Geometry**
- Minkowski's geometry in four-dimensional spacetime (𝕄) compared to Euclidean geometry
- Two situations: real a > 0 vs. imaginary a
- **Real a > 0:** 'Sphere' consists of two pieces, H+ and H-, with metric dℓ2 inherited from embedding in 𝕄
	+ Bowl-shaped H+ lies within future light cone
	+ Hill-shaped H– lies within past light cone
	+ H+ is a model of **hyperbolic geometry** in three dimensions (similar to Lambert's non-Euclidean plane)
		* Geodesics are intersections with 2-planes through O, called hyperbolic straight lines
		* Metric can be studied using light cone sections and their intersections with H+
- **Imaginary a:** One-sheeted hyperboloid spacelike-separated from O, similar to imaginary radius spheres in Euclidean geometry

**Hyperbolic Geometry in Minkowski Space:**
- Intrinsic metric on H+ derived from dℓ2 is better measure due to spacelike directions
- Origins in Lambert's ideas about non-Euclidean geometries (hyperbolic plane)
- Connection to Beltrami's conformal and projective representations.

---

#### Relativity and Hyperbolic Geometry in Velocity Space Exploration

**Beltrami's Models in Minkowski Spacetime:**

**Projective (Klein) Model:**
- Obtained by projecting H+ from origin (0,0,0) to unit circle in t=1 plane
- Represents future timelike directions as points of H+, which can be thought of as velocity space in relativity theory

**Conformal (Poincaré) Model:**
- Obtained by projecting H+ from (-1,0,0) to unit circle in t=0 plane
- Analogous construction works for hyperbolic 3-geometry in ℝ³
- Futhumtimelike directions represented by points of H+ (where a = 1)

**Velocity Composition:**
- In the same direction: add rapidities (hyperbolic lengths)
- In different directions: use triangle law with one-half of their respective rapidities as side lengths

**Rapidity:**
- Measure of 'distance' in hyperbolic space H+, defined by tanh(ρ) = υ for small velocities
- Rapidity represents the measure of 'distance' along H+

**Relativistic Effects:**
- One cannot simply add velocities in the normal way due to the non-Euclidean geometry of hyperbolic space
- A rocket ship traveling at c relative to Earth cannot eject a missile that travels faster than c relative to the Earth

**Further Questions:**
1. Prove the equivalence between the two displayed formulae related to velocity addition using a 'signature-flip' argument.
2. Justify why adding lengths in hyperbolic geometry gives rise to the addition formula used here, namely (u + υ)c/(1 + uυ), for adding velocities in the same spatial direction.
3. Show that the hyperbolic straight lines are represented as straight in the Klein case and by circles meeting the boundary orthogonally in the Poincaré case.
4. Use a 'signature-flip' argument to see why adding lengths in hyperbolic geometry should give rise to this addition formula for velocities.

### 18.5: The celestial sphere as a Riemann sphere

**The Celestial Sphere as a Riemann Sphere**

**Background:**
- Discussing internal geometry of 'boundary at infinity' for hyperbolic geometry H+
- Represents directions along null cone, unattainable by massive particles but accessible to massless ones like photons
- Each point on the sphere represents a limiting velocity along the null cone

**Perception:**
- Stars appear as hemispherical dome in clear night sky
- Only perceiving half of light rays from the light cone, not the entire family S of rays
- Celestial sphere can be thought of as representing past or future cone of event O

**Structure:**
- Topologically a 2-sphere but no particular metric structure unless sliced through specific planes (t=-1 or t=1)
- Velocity-dependent distortion due to stellar aberration effect observed by James Bradley in 1725

**Question:**
- Is there a weaker mathematical structure on S preserving angle notion between curves under observer transformations?

**Answer:**
- Yes, the celestial sphere possesses a conformal structure like the Riemann sphere
  - No metric assigned, but absolute notion of angle is preserved
  - Circular patterns and shapes are transformed as circles under allowable transformations
- Suggestion for labelling stars: assign complex numbers (including infinity) as stereographic coordinates related to polar angles.

**Additional Information:**
- Stellar aberration effect causes small seasonal variation in star's apparent position on celestial sphere due to Earth's orbital velocity
- Observer's velocity influences the perceived map of the celestial sphere, but the conformal structure remains preserved.

#### Relativistic Flattening of Spheres and Perception of Circles in Motion

**FitzGerald-Lorentz "Flattening Effect"**

**Description**: A spherical planet moving at speed υ (near light) in a fixed system appears flattened by factor (1 – υ²/c²)¹/₂ in its direction of motion due to relativity.

**Contradiction with Perceived Circles**: Observing the sphere's horizontal passage overhead may seem to contradict the "perceived circles go to perceived circles" principle, but this effect is not directly observable.

**Explanation**: Light from the rear of the moving sphere reaches the observer from a more distant point than light from its front, resulting in a compensating stretch of the image along the direction of motion.

**Argument for Unobservability**: An argument against direct observation of this effect is given by John L. Synge using geometrical configuration and time progression concepts in Minkowskian reference frames.

**Derivation**: A derivation of the formula can be attempted to understand the underlying principles better.

### 18.6: Newtonian energy and (angular) momentum

**Newtonian Energy and Momentum**

**Conservation Laws in Newtonian Theory**:
- Total energy, momentum, and angular momentum are conserved for a system not acted upon by external forces
- Kinetic energy: mυ² (mass m and speed υ)
- Potential energy: depends on the nature of the forces involved; total potential energy is conserved but individual components may not be
- Momentum: p = mv, vector sum of all particle momenta

**Galilean Relativity**:
- Energy and momentum conservation in one frame are preserved when changing to another uniformly moving frame
- Mass is also conserved, and Newton's third law applies

**Angular Momentum**:
- Angular momentum M = 2x⊗p (position vector x and momentum p)
- Sum the angular momenta of all individual particles to obtain the total

**Other Conserved Quantities in Newtonian Theory**:
- Mass center motion: N = tp – mx, where t is time, m is mass, and x is the position vector
- Constancy of N expresses uniform motion of the mass center

**Transition to Special Relativity**:
- Energy, momentum, angular momentum, and mass-center motion concepts are still valid but require careful definition
- Mass and energy conservation become equivalent through Einstein's equation: E = mc²

---

### 18.7: Relativistic energy and (angular) momentum

**Relativistic Energy and Momentum**

**Energy-Momentum 4-Vector**:
- Total energy E and momentum p unite to form the energy-momentum 4-vector
- Spatial components are (p1, p2, p3) = c^2 * p
- Time-component p0 measures total energy/mass E = mc^2
- Conventions: metric components gab have main diagonal elements (1, -c^2, -c^2, -c^2), and its inverse has (1, -c^2, -c^2, -c^2) on the diagonal

**Momentum as a Covector**:
- Momentum can be viewed as a covector (lower-indexed quantity) pa
- Components are (E, -p)
- Satisfies conservation laws: energy, momentum, and mass are conserved in interactions between particles or systems

**Mass of a System**:
- Total mass is not a scalar quantity in relativity theory
- Mass of a particle increases when measured in a frame where it is moving
- Conserved mass depends on the reference frame

**Rest Mass vs. Rest Energy**:
- **Rest mass** µ: c^2 times rest energy
- Equation: (c^2 µ)^2 = E^2 - c^2 p^2
- Rest mass is equal to the mass measured in the system's own rest frame

**3-Velocity and Momentum**:
- Particle velocity v and momentum p are related through the Lorentz factor γ: p = mγv, where m = γµ

**Massless Particles**:
- Massless particles (e.g., photons) have zero rest mass
- Total mass-energy is conserved in interactions between massive and massless particles

**Angular Momentum**:
- Described by an antisymmetric tensor Mab
- Components for a single non-spinning particle: xa * pb - xb * pa, where xa is the position 4-vector of the particle at a given time
- Total relativistic angular momentum is obtained by adding the angular momenta of individual particles

### 19.3: Conservation and flux laws in Maxwell theory

**Maxwell Theory: Charge Conservation and Flux Laws**

**Charge conservation equation:**
- Electric charge is conserved in Maxwell theory
- Vanishing divergence of charge-current vector `J` implies net flux of charge across a closed 3-surface Q = ∂R is zero
- Total charge flowing into R equals total charge flowing out, expressing charge conservation

**Gauss law:**
- Derived from the second Maxwell equation d * F = 4π* J
- Applies at a specific time t0 and uses three-dimensional version of exterior calculus theorem
- Integral of electric field `E` across closed spatial 2-surface S measures total charge surrounded by S

**Absence of magnetic monopoles:**
- Maxwell equations do not intrinsically forbid magnetic monopoles' existence
- However, no net 'magnetic charge' has been observed in Nature yet

**Related conservation law from first Maxwell equation dF = 0:**
- Flux law with `F` replacing * `F` and a zero source
- Expresses the absence of magnetic monopoles if expressed correctly

**Details and clarifications:**
- Dualizing twice yields minus the original quantity: the sign relates to Lorentzian signature of spacetime (negative for timelike vectors)
- Maxwell equations are unaffected when expressed correctly in a general curvilinear coordinate system
- Spell out the details of charge conservation for a spacetime 'cylinder' with bounded spatial region constant in time and finite t interval.

**Lux of Charge:**
- Electric flux: integral of `*F` over closed spatial 2-surface S measures total charge surrounded by S.
- Contrast electric flux for spacelike base/top vs timelike sides of the cylinder.

### 19.4: The Maxwell Weld as gauge curvature

**Maxwell Equation Implications and Electromagnetic Potential**

**Poincaré lemma**:
- If the r-form α satisfies d α = 0, there is a locally defined (r–1)-form β for which α = dβ.

**Electromagnetic potential A**:
- Implications of the first Maxwell equation: F = 2dA for some 1-form A
- Not uniquely determined by field F, but fixed to within addition of dΘ (real scalar)
- Relation in index form: Fab = ∇aAb – ∇bAa with freedom Aa ↦ Aa + ∇a Θ

**Gauge freedom in electromagnetic potential**:
- Electromagnetic potential is not locally measurable quantity
- Potential provides mathematical key to Maxwell field interacting with physical entity Ψ (charged quantum particle)

**Bundle connection and gauge transformation**:
- Connection ∇a = ∂/∂xa – ieAa, where e is a real number quantifying electric charge of Ψ
- Bundle describes charged fields, acted upon by connection ∇a
- Geometrical nature of bundle: possible values of complex field Ψ
- Electromagnetic gauge transformation replaces Ψ with eiθΨ, insensitive to this replacement called gauge invariance

**Historical comments**:
- Weyl's theory of general relativity introduced path-dependent notion of length in 1918
- No absolute scaling for time or space measures, metric given only up to proportionality
- Transformations (conformal rescalings) allowed without affecting null cones
- Incorporated Maxwell's electromagnetic equations into spacetime geometry.

---

#### Weyl's Gauge Theory in Electromagnetism

**Weyl's Gauge Curvature (Maxwell Field F)**
- Weyl's gauge curvature comes about from a change in conformal time scale when going around an infinitesimal loop
- Essential way to encode electromagnetic potential into a bundle connection without imaginary unit 'i'
- Relevant bundle over M consists of family of proportional Lorentzian metrics, with possible 'λs' in g
- No absolute choice of gauge and preferred metric; only structure additional to conformal one: bundle connection (gauge connection) introduced by Weyl for Maxwell's F as its curvature
  - Curvature measures discrepancy in clock rates as illustrated by Fig. 19.5a, b
- When Einstein heard about this theory, he objected due to spectral frequencies being unaffected and violation of particle mass identity (quantum-mechanical rules)
- Later realized that same idea could work if 'gauge' referred not to real scaling but complex number of unit modulus (eith)
  * This concept is used in modern picture of electromagnetic field interaction, providing U(1)-bundle connection on bundle of charged quantum wavefunctions
- Operator ∇ provides U(1)-bundle connection; path dependence shows up in Aharonov–Bohm effect through non-vanishing potential A within a non-simply-connected region (Fig. 19.6a, b)
  * Non-path dependence depends on topologically non-trivial loop within the field-free region R
  * Triangle inequality of Lorentzian geometry used to explain clock paradox in special relativity
    - AB + BC ≤ AC with equality when A, B, C collinear (Fig. 18.6b)
    - Astronaut experiences shorter time interval than Earth's inhabitants (Fig. 18.6b)
- No need to pass to general relativity for acceleration handling; difference lies in used metric (gij) evaluation of ds

**Poincaré Group Action**
- Explain Weyl's action of the Poincaré group more fully: [18.4]
  - The Poincaré group is a continuous subgroup of the Lorentz group O(3,1) that leaves Minkowski spacetime invariant (ℂE4). It consists of transformations preserving orientation and distance between points in ℝ4.
  - In special relativity, the Poincaré group is equivalent to the orthogonal group SO(3,1) due to homogeneous nature of space and isotropy of time.
  - Discrete subgroups of the Poincaré group lead to particle masses and their classification into representations under Lorentz transformations.
- Under what circumstances is it possible for a 3-plane element η to contain its normal η┴, in 𝕄?: [18.5 (i)]
  * A 3-plane element η is said to contain its normal if the normal lies within the plane spanned by the two other vectors that determine the 3-plane. In Minkowski space ℂE4, this is equivalent to having all components of the normal vector orthogonal to those of any non-normal vector within the 3-plane.
* This means that for a 3-plane η contained in 𝕄, its normal must lie along one of the axes or within an hyperplane orthogonal to two of the coordinate planes. For example, if we consider the plane xy and the normal z-axis, any vector (a, b, c) lies within this 3-plane if a and b are collinear with each other and c is perpendicular to both a and b.

### 19.5: The energy–momentum tensor

**The Energy–Momentum Tensor**

**Background:**
- Prerequisite to understanding gravity as a fundamental field with gauge theory aspects
- Gravity is source of gravitation, mass and energy are equivalent (Einstein's equation: E = mc²)
- Energy density needed for gravity
- Energy–momentum tensor: symmetric, 2nd rank, 4x4 matrix Tab
  that satisfies conservation equation ∇ a Tab = 0

**Comparison with Electric Charge:**
- Conservation equation: ∇ a Ja = 0 (Ja: electric charge vector)
- Energy–momentum tensor collects energy and momentum densities and fluxes
- T0b: energy density, Tij: pressure in spatial directions
- In Minkowski space with flat spacetime, each Ta0, i (i = 1,2,3) satisfies the same conservation equation as Ja, implying integral conservation laws for energy and momentum separately.

**Gravity vs. Other Physical Fields:**
- Energy–momentum tensors for different physical fields added together to yield full energy–momentum tensor T
- Gravity's energy–momentum tensor behaves differently when gravity is present: cannot derive an integral conservation law from ∇ a Tab = 0 due to the extra index b in Tab.

**Solution:**
- Curved spacetime, where "∇ a" is no longer simply "∂/∂xa," requires considering additional terms that confuse energy–momentum conservation and prevent deriving an integral conservation law for energy and momentum using only the conservation equation ∇ a Tab = 0.

**Perspective on Conservation Laws:**
- Killing vectors represent continuous symmetries of spacetime M (10 independent in Minkowski space)
- Time translational symmetry: energy conservation
- Space translational symmetry: momentum conservation
- Rotational symmetry: angular momentum conservation
- Lagrangian formalism allows derivation of conservation laws from each system's continuous symmetries.

#### Understanding Energy-Momentum Conservation in General Relativity with Killing Vectors

**General Relativity: Conservation Laws and Energy-Momentum**

**Flux Quantity and Killing Vector**
- Obtain conservation laws from Killing vectors κ by constructing flux quantity La = Tab κb, satisfying ∇ a La = 0 when ∇ a Tab = 0
- Integral conservation law: Q * L = 0 holds only for spacetimes with appropriate symmetry given by κ
- Physically, decoupling of degrees of freedom in spacetime geometry (gravity) and fields allows for these conservation laws to hold as undisturbed backgrounds.

**Challenges with Energy–Momentum Conservation in General Relativity:**
- Uneasiness among physicists regarding missing conservation laws when gravity enters the picture
- Einstein's theory accounts for energy–momentum conservation in a sophisticated way, especially in non-uniform gravitational fields (§19.8)

**Symmetric Tensor T and Energy–Momentum Conservation:**
- Include all non-gravitational fields' energy–momentum within symmetric tensor T
- Exclude gravity's energy from representation within T
- Principle of equivalence supports this perspective: observers in free orbit expect energy conservation without gravitational field contributions until tidal effects arise.

**Components of Tensor Ta b:**
- Local Minkowskian frame with diagonal form (1, – 1, – 1, – 1) components T00, T11, T22, and T33
- Satisfies conservation equation ∇ a Tab = 0 if J = 0.

**Maxwell's Expression for Energy Density:**
- Recover Maxwell’s original expression (E² + B²)/8π from the components of Ta in a local Minkowskian frame.

**Why This Procedure Specializes to Specific Conservation Laws:**
- Not clear why this procedure specializes to the above ∇ a Ta 0 = 0, etc.

**Continuous Field vs Discrete System:**
- Find an analogue of continuous-field conservation law ∇ a (Tab κb) = 0 for a discrete system with energy–momentum conservation in collisions. Hint: Find a constant quantity given Killing vector κa for each particle between collisions.

---

### 19.6: Einstein’s field equation

**Einstein's Field Equation**

**Background:**
- Tensor formalism needed to describe spacetime curvature in 4 dimensions
- No preferred coordinates: principle of equivalence and general covariance
- Gravitation manifests as spacetime curvature, not a force
- Tidal forces represent effects on observer A
- Geodesic world lines reveal volume reduction and acceleration

**Newtonian Expectation:**
- Volume acceleration due to matter density: –4πGTab δV
- Spacetime curvature effect on volume acceleration: Rab ta tb δV
- Suggested field equation: Rab = –4πGTab

**Problem with Proposed Equation:**
- Contracted Bianchi identity leads to constant trace T of energy–momentum tensor throughout spacetime, which is inconsistent with ordinary physics.

**Solution:**
- Consistency requires equating the two tensors satisfying conservation equation: Einstein's field equation
- Symmetric Ricci tensor: Rab = Racb c (figure 19.7)
- Vacuum solution: Rab – Rgab = 0 or Rab = 0 (Ricci-flat space).

**Additional Questions:**
- Why is the Ricci tensor symmetric?
- Prove it using the Ricci identity and tensor properties.
- Show that we can 'lop off' all ta tb by explaining the role of symmetry in tensors.
- Use diagrammatic notation to show this.

---

### 19.7: Further issues: cosmological constant

**The Weyl Tensor and Cosmological Constant (19.7)**
- The cosmological constant Λ was suggested by Einstein in 1917 as an additional term to address a static, spatially closed universe
- It is a tiny constant quantity with no observational relevance until cosmological scales are reached
- The term Rab – Rgab + Λgab satisfies the 'conservation equation' since Λ is constant (and ∇g = 0)
- The modified Einstein equation reads: Rab – Rgab + Λgab = –8πG Tab
- This allows for a non-zero cosmological constant in equations, although acceptance of this term has been reluctant among theorists

**The Cosmological Constant and Pressure Terms**
- The pressure terms play significant roles under certain extreme conditions, such as when a very massive star is collapsing
- These pressure contributions to active gravitational mass can increase the tendency for collapse due to the extra gravitational mass produced

**Analogies in Gravity and Maxwell Theory**
- The energy–momentum tensor Tab is similar to the charge-current vector Ja of Maxwell theory
- The metric tensor g may be analogous to the electromagnetic potential A, while the full Riemann curvature tensor is not directly related to gravitational degrees of freedom
- A more appropriate choice for describing gravitational field degrees of freedom is the Weyl tensor or conformal tensor Cabcd

**The Weyl Tensor in Free Space and Conformal Flatness**
- In free space with no matter (and Λ = 0), the Weyl tensor equals the Riemann curvature tensor
- The condition for conformal flatness is the vanishing of the Weyl tensor

---

### 19.8: Gravitational field energy

**Gravitational Field Energy**

**Mass/Energy in Gravitational Field**:
- No room for such energy in the energy–momentum tensor T
- However, there are situations where 'disembodied' gravitational energy plays a physical role
- Example: Two massive bodies (planets) close together have negative potential energy contribution, reducing total energy and mass compared to when they are far apart
- Total contributions from actual energy–momentum tensor T are the same in both cases
- Difference in total mass/energy would be attributed to energy in the gravitational field itself

**Gravitational Waves**:
- Gravitational waves (ripples in spacetime) emanate from a system undergoing motion, such as orbiting bodies
- Energy loss due to gravitational waves is usually very small (e.g., 40-watt light bulb)
- For more massive and violent systems, like coalescing black holes, energy loss would be significant and detectable by current/future instruments
- Example: PSR 1913+16 double neutron star system, observed over 25 years with extraordinary precision
- Timing of electromagnetic signals provides confirmation of Einstein's general relativity to 1 part in 10^14 accuracy

**Observational Tests of General Relativity**:
- Early observational tests were limited to the "three tests": Mercury's perihelion advance, starlight bending, and clock slowing
- Subsequent observations, like gravitational lensing effects, provide more impressive support for general relativity

- Boscovich argued for Newtonian view but not gravitational waves
- Weyl observed gravitational redshift and discovered relation between gravity and curvature in spacetime (Weyl, 1928)
  * Independent observations by Gordon, Pauli, Heisenberg.

**Other Observations:**
- Aharonov and Bohm's effect: electron wave function changes near a charged object (Aharonov & Bohm, 1959)
- Experimentally verified by Chambers; more convincingly established by Tonomura et al. (1982, 1986).

## 20. Lagrangians and Hamiltonians 
###  20.1: The magical Lagrangian formalism

**Lagrangians and Hamiltonians**

**Introduction**:
- In centuries following Newton, theoretical work was built up from his dynamical laws
- Euler, Laplace, Lagrange, Legendre, Gauss, Liouville, Ostrogradski, Poisson, Jacobi, Hamilton, and others reformulated ideas
- Resulted in a mathematically elegant unifying picture, providing deep insights into the mathematical underpinnings of physical universe

**Lagrangian Picture**:
- Lagrangian function is defined on tangent bundle T(C) of configuration space C
- Determines positions and velocities of particles/rigid bodies in N-dimensional configuration space C
- Coordinates (generalized coordinates) label points q1, ..., qN in configuration space C
- **Generalized velocities** are rates of change of these generalized coordinates with respect to time
- Lagrangian function is difference between kinetic energy K and potential energy V
- Euler-Lagrange equations express system's Newtonian behavior as a requirement that the action (integral of L along curve in C) be stationary under variations of the curve.

---

#### Euler-Lagrange equations and Hamilton's principle in motion optimization for particle trajectories in a field.

**Euler-Lagrange Equations**
* Method used to find trajectories that minimize a functional's value (action)
* Applicable when searching for optimal paths in configuration space C
* Determines motion of point Q along curve with tangent direction based on values of qr
* Minimizes the integral of Lagrangian L along curve between fixed end points a and b in C
* Situation similar to finding minimums, maxima, or saddle points in calculus
* Stationary values are all points where df/dx = 0 (Fig. 20.4)
* Characterization of geodesics in Riemannian space as minimum-length paths or stationary curves
* Lagrangian L takes the place of function f, but specifying a path requires infinitely many parameters
* Example: Newtonian particle moving in external field with potential V (Fig. 20.3)
	+ Lagrangian L = m(ẋ² + ẏ² + ż²) – V(x, y, z; t)
	+ Euler-Lagrange equation for z gives Galileo's constant acceleration: d(mż)/dt = -mg.

### 20.2: The more symmetrical Hamiltonian picture

**The Hamiltonian Picture**
* In this picture, we use generalized coordinates q1, ..., qN and their corresponding momentum coordinates p1, ..., pN
* Momentum coordinates can be derived from a Lagrangian using the defining formula 
* These parameters serve to provide coordinates for the cotangent spaces T*(C), allowing for the representation of covectors as pa ⊤ dqa (a 1-form) and its exterior derivative S = dpa ⊤ dqa being a symplectic form on the phase space
* This provides a natural symplectic structure, which is independent of the chosen Hamiltonian and describes the dynamics of a system
* Hamilton's dynamical equations describe time evolution as a trajectory in the phase space T*(C), governed by the Hamiltonian function H
* These equations are beautifully symmetrical and represent the velocity vector field on T*(C) that describes Newtonian behavior of the system
* In the case of constant gravitational field, the Hamiltonian is given by the total energy expressed in terms of position and momentum components or obtained from the Lagrangian using standard procedures. 

**Notational Acknowledgement:**
- In the example provided, spatial momentum components px, py, pz are negatives of normal momentum components in a flat spacetime with (+ – – –) signature
- The author uses a combination of qa and pa with usual sign conventions connecting p to q, but when using xa and pa, they mean the notation consistent with that of §18.7 (equal to p1, p2, p3 in standard Minkowski frame)
- Any reader not concerned with full formalism details can ignore this issue.

**Additional Questions:**
* Complete the argument for Galileo's parabolic motion under free fall using a Lagrangian approach (Question 20.1)
* What is the purpose of using a Hamiltonian picture in physics? Why not just use a Lagrangian approach? (Question 20.3)
* Explain Hamilton's dynamical equations and their significance in describing system behavior (Question 20.4).

### 20.3: Small oscillations

**Vibrations of Physical Systems**

**Simple Harmonic Motion**:
- Small oscillations about equilibrium state
- Period is independent of amplitude for small oscillations (Galileo's observation)
- Equation of motion: `q = a cos(ωt) + b sin(ωt)` where q is the displacement from equilibrium, ω is the frequency, and a and b are constants

**Hamiltonian Formalism for Vibrations**:
- Analytically described using Hamilton's equations in the Hamiltonian formalism
- **Small oscillations about an equilibrium state** are considered
- Assumes Hamiltonian is an analytic expression in generalized coordinates q and momenta p
- Equilibrium is a minimum of potential energy, and kinetic energy is minimum at pa = 0
- Power series expansion of the Hamiltonian around the equilibrium point starts with `H = T + V = Paq + Qab/2` where T is the kinetic energy and V is the potential energy
- Eigenvectors of the matrix `W = PQ` determine the normal modes of oscillation, with distinct positive eigenvalues (normal frequencies)

**Normal Modes of Oscillation**:
- Normal mode: All generalized coordinates qa vibrate together at the same frequency (called the normal frequency)
- Distinct normal frequencies for most general case, but can be degenerate in special cases
- Total number of normal modes is equal to the number N of generalized coordinates
- Orthogonality of normal modes: Two distinct normal modes are orthogonal with respect to the metric defined by Q (inner product `rT Qq = 0`)

---

#### Exploring Normal Modes, Vibrations, and Equilibrium in Quantum Mechanics

**Additional Points:**
- Explicitly obtaining Newtonian equations using Hamilton's equations for particle falling in constant gravitational field (Do this explicitly)
- Confirming relationship between frequency and angular frequency, explaining why graph still looks like a sine curve (Confirm this)
- Deriving general solution of simple cases using Lagrangian method, Hamiltonian method, and directly from Newton's laws (Show this, finding the full equation)
- Unstable equilibrium systems: Linear terms are not necessarily present but can be explained by considering eigenvectors in degenerate cases. (Can you explain all this more fully? Can we have the linear terms if the equilibrium is unstable? Explain.)
- Proving that inverse of positive-definite matrix is also positive-definite (Prove this)
- Carrying out analysis using Lagrangian form instead of Hamiltonian form (Describe the system of eigenvectors in such degenerate cases. Prove this deduction.)

### 20.4: Hamiltonian dynamics as symplectic geometry

**Hamiltonian dynamics as symplectic geometry**

**Symplectic manifolds and Poisson bracket**:
- Symplectic manifolds possess a Poisson bracket operation, which takes two scalar fields Φ and Ψ to produce another scalar field Θ
- If the 'Ψ slot' is left blank, we get the **differential operator {Φ,},** a vector field that acts on Ψ to give {Φ, Ψ}

**Hamiltonian evolution**:
- The vector field {H,} corresponds to Hamilton's equations and represents the system's trajectories in phase space

**Symplectic geometry and dynamical evolution**:
- Symplectic geometry allows the dynamical evolution of a system to be encapsulated in a single scalar function (the Hamiltonian)
- **Liouville's theorem**: The volume element in phase space is preserved by Hamiltonian evolution, as is the full volume form Σ

**Trajectories and reduced phase space**:
- Each trajectory lies on a (2N – 1)-dimensional surface of constant Hamiltonian H
- The reduced phase space (trajectories for fixed H) is a (2N – 2)-dimensional symplectic manifold

**Hamiltonian framework in quantum mechanics**:
- Provides important insights into the standard non-relativistic quantum theory
- Quantum versions of Hamiltonians are essential for the standard quantum formalism
- In relativistic quantum theory, the **Lagrangian framework** is more naturally used to develop **quantum field theory**

---

### 20.5: Lagrangian treatment of Welds

**Lagrangian Treatment of Fields**

**Newtonian Systems**:
- Consist of a finite number of particles and rigid bodies
- Configuration space M, its tangent bundle T(M), and cotangent bundle T* (M) are finite-dimensional manifolds

**Functional Differentiation**:
- Lagrangian (and Hamiltonian) formalism can be applied to physical fields
- Configuration space is infinite-dimensional
- Requires the concept of functional differentiation

**Lagrangian Functionals**:
- Lagrangian is a function of fields Φ, ..., Ψ and their derivatives ▽a Φ, ..., ▽a Ψ
- No special role for time derivatives
- Formalism brought into line with relativity requirements
- Lagrangians often called "functionals" due to the functional form

**Euler–Lagrange Equations**:
- Involve "derivatives with respect to fields" and "gradients of fields"
- Mirror operations of ordinary calculus
- Mathematical subtleties may arise, but physicists often do not worry about them

**Hamilton's Principle**:
- Expresses the Euler–Lagrange equations as the stationarity of the action integral
- Action is the integral of Lagrangian over a region D in spacetime
- Field configurations on the boundary ∂D are like fixed points in configuration space

---

### 20.6: How Lagrangians drive modern theory

**Lagrangian Theory in Modern Physics**

**Influence of Lagrangian Theory**:
- Highly influential role in modern physics
- Many remarkable uses, such as:
  - **Nöther's theorem**
    - If a Lagrangian has continuous symmetry, there is a conservation law associated with that symmetry
    - Examples:
      - Time translation invariance leads to conserved energy
      - Spatial translation invariance leads to conserved momentum
      - Angular rotation invariance leads to conserved angular momentum
- Suitable for Lagrangian functionals of fields, such as gauge invariance in electromagnetism and general relativity

**Limitations of Nöther's Theorem**:
- Difficulties applying to general relativity
  - No clear solution for energy-momentum conservation
  - Gauge symmetry "invariance under general coordinate transformations" not addressed by Nöther's theorem

**Lagrangian Functionals in Fundamental Physics**:
- New theories are typically presented as a Lagrangian functional
- Advantages of this approach:
  - Chance of consistency and invariance properties
  - "Newton's third law" is implicit (interaction is mutual)
  - Lagrangians can be added to include new fields with required interaction terms
- Direct route to quantum theory via path-integral approach

**Criticisms of Lagrangian Approach**:
- Unease about the generality and lack of physical understanding, especially for field theories
- Choice of Lagrangians is often not unique or contrived

## 21. The quantum particle 
###  21.1: Non-commuting variables

**Quantum Particle: Non-commuting Variables**
* Quantum mechanics revolutionizes our understanding of the world at submicroscopic levels, challenging classical pictures
* Lagrangian/Hamiltonian collection of procedures provides background for quantum-mechanical theory with some modifications
* Heaviside's observation: differential operators can be treated like numbers (operator D)
* Example: solving a differential equation using Heaviside's method and power series expansion
* Be cautious when mixing D and x variables, they do not commute
* Extending to multiple variables and operators (D1,…,DN) in N-dimensional space 𝔼 N
* Operators describe infinitesimal translations of the affine space in each axis direction
* Symmetry of the space is associated with momentum conservation through Nöther's theorem.

#### Quantum Mechanics Symmetry and Differential Equations

**Mathematical Facts and Quantum Mechanics**
- Elegant fact: In Euclidean N-space, there are N independent translational symmetries generated by operators D1 to DN.
- These operators satisfy commutation relations with respective coordinates xa and b. [Reference: Formulae in §6.5]

**Exercises:**

**[21.1]**: Demonstrate that (1 + D2)cos(x) = 0 and (1 + D2)sin(x) = 0 using the formulas from §6.5.

**[21.2]**: Find the general solution of (1 + D2)y = x^(1/2) to prove your answer is indeed the most general one.

**[21.3]**: Explain why the given procedure in the text misses some solutions given in Exercise [21.2]. Suggest a modified general procedure to find all the solutions. Hint: Consider if "1 – D2 + D4 – D6 +…" truly satisfies the inverse requirements for 1 + D2.

**[21.4]**: Why does the provided text's procedure miss most of the solutions given in Exercise [21.2]? Can you suggest a modified general procedure that finds them all? Hint: Analyze if "1 – D2 + D4 – D6 +…" genuinely fits as an inverse to 1 + D2 by acting on (1 + D2)cos(x) with this infinite expression.

---

### 21.2: Quantum Hamiltonians

**Quantum Hamiltonians**

**Definition of Quantum Momentum**:
- Identified with a differential operator, named iħ∂/∂xa
- Factor of Dirac's version of Planck's constant (ħ) and imaginary unit (i) are incorporated
- Defined to replace classical momentum pa in the Hamiltonian function H

**Canonical Commutation Rule**:
- Relates position xa and momentum pxa through a commutation law
- Plays an important role in the procedure of canonical quantization

**Role of Quantum Momentum**:
- Used to slot into the classical Hamiltonian function, replacing spatial momenta
- Key step in the process of quantumization

**Coordinate Space 𝔼N**:
- Space with much larger dimensions than just 3D, due to multiple particles or structures
- No explicit time dependence is allowed in the Hamiltonian

**Time Component x0 vs. Spatial Components x1, x2, x3**:
- Evident relativistic symmetry between them
- Important for defining time evolution in quantum mechanics

**Example: Quantum Hamiltonian of a Single Particle**:
- Mass m moving in an external field with potential energy V(x, y, z)
- Classical Hamiltonian: ∑(px2 + py2 + pz2) = Laplacian (∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 + ∂2/∂z2)
- Quantum (canonically quantized) Hamiltonian: iħ∂/∂xa, where a denotes each spatial axis

**Factor Ordering Problem**:
- Ambiguity when replacing classical momenta with quantum ones in the Hamiltonian
- Resolved by choice governed by symmetry, physical or mathematical considerations

**Coordinate Freedom in Quantum Theory**:
- Complete freedom to choose coordinates q1, …, qN on configuration space C is not allowed in quantum theory
- Issue addressed through geometric quantization, particularly important for general relativity and curved spacetime backgrounds.

---

### 21.3: Schrödinger’s equation

**Schrödinger's Equation**

**Quantum Mechanics and Hamiltonian**:
- Quantum mechanical Hamiltonians play a crucial role in Schrödinger's equation, which describes how quantum systems evolve over time
- The form of the Schrödinger equation is determined by the rules set up for commutators
- The "invisible" wavefunction ψ is used to represent the quantum state of the system
- This wavefunction depends on spatial coordinates (x1, ..., xN) and time (t), but not momenta

**Interpreting Time Evolution**:
- Classically, the Hamiltonian represents total energy. Quantum theory requires that energy be replaced by differentiation with respect to time
- The Schrödinger equation expresses this "quantum role" of the total-energy interpretation of the Hamiltonian

**Physical Interpretation**:
- Momentum is conserved and must go somewhere, so it is linked to differential operators
- Frequency and energy have a universal association, as do wave numbers and momenta
- Experimental evidence supports this "wavy" association between physical quantities and differential operators

**Exercises**:
- Solve the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a constant gravitational field
- Show that the Schrödinger equation transforms to one without a gravitational field when transformed to the freely falling frame
- Consider the implications of these results for Einstein's principle of equivalence as applied to quantum systems

---

### 21.4: Quantum theory’s experimental background

**Quantum Theory's Experimental Background**

**Crystalline Structures and Electron Waves**:
- Davisson and Germer experiment: electrons reflected at precise angles based on atomic lattice in crystalline materials
- Inverse relationship between electron momentum p and distance of periodic displacement
- Particles display wave-like behavior with universal relationship to rest mass (Planck and de Broglie formulae)

**Converse: Wavelike Entities as Particles**:
- Photoelectric effect: electrons emitted from materials without dependence on light intensity
- Einstein's explanation using photons (particles of light) with energy E = hv
- Previous evidence: Max Planck's analysis of black-body radiation in 1900, revealing quantum mechanical nature of light

**Black-Body Radiation and the Quantum Revolution**:
- Prior to Planck, wave picture of electromagnetic radiation led to paradoxical Rayleigh–Jeans formula with divergent intensity for large frequencies
- Wien's proposal treating radiation as classical particles provided some accuracy but couldn't explain small frequencies
- Planck's analysis in 1900 provided the correct black-body spectrum formula, fitting observations perfectly

---

#### Quantum Wave-Particle Duality and Planck's Constant.

**Planck's Constant and Wave-Particle Duality**

**Planck's Postulate**:
- Planck postulated that electromagnetic oscillations could only be absorbed or emitted in bundles of a specific energy `E`
- The energy `E` was related to the frequency `v` of oscillation through the relation: `E = hv`

**Quantum Mechanics and Photons**:
- The physical puzzle was that electromagnetic effects seemed to have properties of both waves and particles (photons)
- Further insights from Einstein, Bose, and others led to understanding Planck's relation as referring to actual "particles" - the quanta of Maxwell's electromagnetism called photons

**Two-Slit Experiment**:
- One of the most convincing reasons for particles behaving like waves and waves like particles is the two-slit experiment:
  - Particles behave like waves when they encounter a barrier with two narrowly separated parallel slits
  - This leads to an interference pattern on the screen, showing regions that cannot be reached even though individual particles can reach them when one or both slits are open
- The spacing of the bands on the screen gives the wavelength of the "wave/particle", which is related to the particle's momentum through the same formula as before: `λ = 2πħ/p`

**Translation Invariance and Momentum Conservation**:
- If a quantum Hamiltonian `H` has a translation invariance, then the corresponding momentum `p` is conserved
- This is because the operator `p` commutes with the time evolution `∂/∂t`, implying conservation of momentum.

---

### 21.5: Understanding wave–particle duality

**Understanding wave–particle duality**
- Miracle that experimental facts of waves being particles and particles being waves can be accommodated within a mathematical formalism
- Formalism identifies momentum with 'differentiation with respect to position' and energy with 'differentiation with respect to time'
- This formalism helps understand wave–particle duality by describing a **wavefunction** ψ(xa) that provides a particle's 4-momentum Pa and wavelike spatial and temporal periodicities
- Eigenfunctions of the quantum momentum operator pa = iħ∂/∂xa have definite classical momentum values, called **momen**tum states
- **Eigenfunctions** (or **eigenstates**) play a key role in the quantum formalism as they are the states for which specific dynamical variables have definite values
- In this text, Pa is treated as a 4-dimensional spacetime quantity, but the Schrödinger equation does not follow special relativity's principles, so non-relativistic descriptions will be used moving forward.

### 21.6: What is quantum ‘reality’?

**Quantum Reality: Interpreting State Vectors**

**Background:**
- Questioning the nature of reality in quantum mechanics
- Uncertainty about defining 'reality' among physicists
- Wave functions and state vectors as potential representations of reality

**State Vector Characteristics:**
1. **Non-localized**: spread out over entire universe, no well-defined position
2. **Momentum states vs wave packets:** idealization, more localized with a finite spread
3. **Complex values**: magnitude has the same value everywhere but phase exhibits 'twisting' behavior in complex plane (argued as wavefunction argument or phase)
4. **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**: absolute limit to how small the spread can be for a momentum state.

**Wave Functions and State Vectors:**
- Complex-valued waves, not necessarily oscillating in magnitude
- Arguments (phasor) have a 'wavy' character but are twisted round and around in complex plane

**Visualizing Wave Functions:**
1. **Momentum state**: corkscrew pattern on the unit circle of complex plane (right-handed for positive momentum).
2. **Wave packet**: similar to a corkscrew but with tapering off outside certain interval.

---

#### Quantum Wave Function Interference in Two-Slit Experiment

**Fig. 21.5: A Particle Wavefunction**
- **ψ**: particle wave function as a complex function of position x
- (a) Momentum state e–iPx/h, depicted as a corkscrew (eigenfunction of momentum p)
- (b) A wave packet

**Fig. 21.6: Planes of Constant Phase**
- For a momentum eigenstate with spacing hp –1
- P: magnitude of spatial 3-momentum

**Complexity in Understanding Waves**
- Imagining waves in all dimensions (including the complex plane) is hard
- Useful description for considering:
  - Photon wavefunction encountering a crystal
  - Two-slit experiment with localized region on screen
- In two-slit experiment, component parts have slightly different directions
- Where phases agree: reinforcement, greatest probability of arrival at the screen
- Halfway between maxima: cancellation, zero probability of electron reaching the screen

**Comparison to Ordinary Waves**
- Describing wave interference like in sea or sound waves
- Manifestation of particle nature: marks on screen occur one at a time

**Complex Numbers and Wave Packets**
- Replace real number C in the above displayed expression with complex number C + iD (where C and D are real)
- Find frequency and location of peak for wave packet.

### 21.7: The ‘holistic’ nature of a wavefunction

**Two-Slit Experiment and Holistic Nature of Wavefunctions**

**Two-slit experiment**:
- Idealized form: does not allow for individual probabilities at separate locations
- Violation of law of conservation of charge if two spots appeared on the screen at widely separated locations
- Electrons and neutrons exhibit self-interference, causing two-slit experiment behavior

**Interpreting Wavefunctions**:
- Must think of entire wavefunction as describing a single particle
- Probability refers to just one particle, not individual probabilities at separate places
- Cannot imagine the different parts of the wave acting independently
- Wavefunctions are non-local and holistic entities

**Experiment with Beamsplitter**:
- Photon's wavefunction starts out as a neat little wave packet but divides into two parts after encountering beam-splitter
- One or other colleague can detect the photon, but they cannot both do so
- Colleagues are over 1.4 light years apart, preventing "instantaneous communication" between them
- Quantum mechanics predicts that only one colleague will receive the photon each time the experiment is performed
- Classical waves cannot achieve this behavior

---

#### Quantum Particle's Non-Local Holistic Character Through Interferometry Experiments

**Photon Behavior in Experiments: Wavefunction and Particle-like Aspects**

**Experiment with beam splitter:**
- Photon's wavefunction starts as a neat packet at source
- Divides into two after encountering beam splitter
- After one year, arrives at detectors D and E
- Only one detector can register the photon

**Skepticism:**
- Photon might have made its choice at beam splitter
- But wavefunction aspect needed for other experiments

**Additional Experiment:**
- Colleagues reflect wavefunction parts to fourth location
- Both parts encounter second beam splitter, where interference occurs
  - Constructive at A and destructive at B
  - Photon only activates detector A

**Mach–Zehnder Interferometer:**
- On an interstellar scale: not performed but ground-based versions exist
- Photon seems to have 'foresight' to know experiment setup

**Quantum Theory Perspective:**
- No foresight given to particle, accepts non-local holistic character of wavefunction
- Wavefunction split into two parts at initial beam splitter
  - Particle-like aspect only shows up when measurement performed
    - Holistic character manifested through appearance in one place only.

---

### 21.8: The mysterious ‘quantum jumps’

**Mysteries of Quantum Jumps**
- Question: What constitutes a "measurement" in quantum mechanics?
- Curious shift from wavefunction description to localized particle during detection
- Similar phenomenon observed with detectors in two-slit experiment
- Wavelike aspects must be maintained until measurement, then particle-like description used for discontinuous change (quantum jump)
- Issue: Why adopt different mathematical procedure for measurements?
- Schrödinger uncomfortable with quantum jumps, saw them as inadequate representation of reality
- Evolution of state vector not covered by continuous evolution through Schrödinger equation
- Many physicists doubt wavefunction can be taken seriously as description of physical reality
- Particle-like aspects show up in measurements; wavelike ones between measurements
- Not all measurements are limited to position; momentum and angular momentum measurements also valid
- Discussion on relationship between measurements of position and momentum in next section
- Mathematical description of physical measurement different from Schrödinger quantum evolution
- Controversial issues surrounding this fact to be discussed later, most comprehensively in Chapter 29.

---

### 21.9: Probability distribution in a wavefunction

**Probability Distribution in a Wavefunction**

**Interpreting the Wavefunction**:
- The squared modulus of the wavefunction (ψ) is interpreted as a probability distribution
- This gives the likelihood of finding the particle at various spatial locations
- The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space must be 1

**Normalization Requirement**:
- The wavefunction (ψ) is **normalized** if its integral over all space is equal to 1
- Some wavefunctions, like momentum states, do not satisfy this requirement and are unrealizable idealizations
- Normalizable wavefunctions can be normalized by dividing the wavefunction by the square root of its norm

**Physical Interpretation**:
- The wavefunction (ψ) represents the same physical situation when multiplied by a non-zero complex constant
- This is equivalent to considering ψ and eiθ⋅ψ as physically equivalent
- Passing from the complex vector space W to its projective space ℙW allows for more relaxed normalization conditions

**Probability Density**:
- The probability density is given by |ψ|^2 divided by the integral of |ψ|^2 over all space
- For some states, this results in a trivial probability distribution (e.g., momentum states)

**Critique of "Probability Wave" Description**:
- The wavefunction (ψ) itself is complex and cannot be a probability
- The phase of ψ is an essential ingredient for the Schrödinger evolution
- Probabilities are never negative, let alone complex

**Gauge Transformations**:
- If the wavefunction describes a charged particle, gauge transformations (ψ → eiθ⋅ψ) can be applied to preserve the physical situation
- These transformations must be accompanied by changes in the momentum operators to leave the physical evolution unaltered

---

### 21.10: Position states

**Position States**
* Wavefunction must be more 'real' than a probability wave
* Schrödinger equation provides precise evolution in time for this entity
* Evolution depends critically upon phase variation from place to place
* Measuring position leads to loss of phase distribution information
* New wavefunction has to be strongly peaked at measured location, but rapidly disperses again
* Idealized function (hyperfunction or distribution) described by a Dirac delta function
* For precise measurement, new state is infinitely peaked at that location
* Formalism deals with this through eigenstates of position operators
* Eigenvalue equation: x1 ψ = X1 ψ
* Satisfied by ψ = δ(x1 – X1), where δ(x) is Dirac's delta function
* This wavefunction is not a function in the ordinary sense but an idealized function (hyperfunction or distribution)
* Position states are infinitely concentrated, unlike momentum states which are infinitely spread out.
* Both position and momentum states are not normalizable due to the nature of delta functions.
* Important duality between position and momentum: concentration vs. spreading

---

### 21.11: Momentum-space description

**Momentum-Space Description**

**Representing Quantum States**:
- Until now, quantum states have been represented solely as functions of position (wavefunctions)
- This means they are thought of as linear combinations of eigenstates of the position operator `x`
- Can also represent a state as a linear combination of momentum states `e^(iPx/h)`
- The "coefficients" are now different complex numbers, which are (2π)-3/2 times the quantities (`P`)

**Fourier Transform Formula**:
- Formula expresses `ψ(x)` as a Fourier transform of some function `ψ(P)`, similar to 9.4, but 3D
- This means that `ψ(p)` provides an equally good representation of the particle's quantum states

**Symmetry Between Position and Momentum Variables**:
- Can consider regarding momentum variables as primary, with position as "differentiation with respect to p"
- Commutation relations are satisfied, identical to those before, but with `pbxa - xa pb` being a function of `pa`, not `xa`

**Representation of Momentum and Position States**:
- Momentum states are represented by delta functions `δ(p–P)`
- Position states are represented as plane waves `e^(-iPx/h)`
- The "inverse Fourier transform" is similar to the original, with a minor sign change in the exponent

**Wave Packets in Momentum and Position Space**:
- Spread measures (Δx and Δp) can be defined for wave packets in both representations
- Heisenberg's uncertainty relation holds, relating product of spreads to `h`

**Illustrations of States**:
- Fig. 21.10 illustrates position-space pictures on the left and corresponding momentum-space pictures on the right
- Top pair: pure momentum state, with infinite spread in position
- Middle pair: wave packet, with finite spreads in both
- Bottom pair: pure position state, with infinite spread in momentum
- Measuring position disturbs the purity of a momentum state

#### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and Quantum Mechanics - Energy/Time Relation and Wave Packet Analysis

**Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**
- Relevance to unstable nuclei: energy uncertainty is reciprocally related to its lifetime (10^-51 Joules for Uranium-238 with a 109 year half-life)
- Mass uncertainty is also affected due to Einstein's E=mc^2 equation.
- Energy/time uncertainty relation has implications in quantum measurement resolution (§30.11)

**Differential Equations:**
- Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE): involves only ordinary differential operators like d/dx or its powers
- Partial Differential Equation (PDE): includes partial differential operators ∂/∂x, ∂^2/∂x^2, etc.

**Wave Function Manipulations:**
- Replacing ψ with x^1 ψ or iħ∂ψ/∂x corresponds to replacing ψ by p^1 or iħ∂ψ/∂p, respectively.
- Replacing ψ(xa) by ψ(xa+Ca) leads to the Fourier transform of a wave packet (see Exercise [21.16])

**Quantum Mechanics:**
- In de Broglie–Bohm theory, both wave and particle aspects are retained. The particle chooses at beam splitter while the wave explores both routes simultaneously until final beam splitter instructs particle to reach detector A or forbid it from reaching B (§21.8)
- Heisenberg reported that particles make a choice at the beam splitter in his experiments, but the wave carries on exploring both paths (unconventional viewpoint)

**Notes:**
- Time independence ensures interpretation of H as conserved energy (see also Note 20.3)
- Idealizing the situation in experiment descriptions to get essential point across
- Various authors use different definitions for 'norm'
- Legitimate to multiply delta functions if they refer to different variables
- Quantum mechanical formalism can be developed elegantly within projective framework (see Brody and Hughston, Ashtekar and Schilling)
- Commuting observables discussed in any text on quantum mechanics.

## 22. Quantum algebra, geometry, and spin 
###  22.1: The quantum procedures U and R

**Quantum Algebra and Spin**

**The Non-intuitive Nature of Quantum Mechanics**:
- Many people despair of finding a trustworthy picture of quantum-level phenomena
- There is beautiful geometry associated with quantum mechanics in addition to its elegant algebraic structure

**Single Point Particle Description**:
- A single particle appears to be a mysterious spread-out wavy thing in the quantum formalism
- It can be pictured, having a fascinating mathematical structure

**Multiple Particles and Self-Entangled Systems**:
- When considering several particles together, the entire quantum system requires a self-entangled single state vector

**Spin**:
- Individual "point particles" often possess spin
- This leads to extra complication in the mathematical description

**Schrödinger Equation and State Vector Evolution**:
- The Schrödinger equation provides unitary (continuous, deterministic) evolution of the state vector U
- However, a measurement would cause the state to collapse (discontinuous, probabilistic) R

**Alternating Procedures**:
- Quantum mechanics alternates between U and R procedures, which appear odd
- Some physicists believe this is an approximation to a more general mathematical equation or principle

**Conventional Attitudes to Quantum Mechanics**:
- Many "conventional" attitudes to quantum mechanics see U as the underlying truth, with R being some kind of approximation, illusion, or convenience
- Understanding the unitary evolution of the state vector U is necessary for moving beyond the current scheme

---

### 22.2: The linearity of U and its problems for R

**Linearity of U: Incompatibility with R**

**Examining Linearity of U**
- Schrödinger's equation: iħ∂ψ/∂t = Hψ
- Immediate consequences of the general form
  - Deterministic time evolution
    * Complete once state is known at one time
  - Complex equation with occurrences of i
  - Linear (superposition principle)

**Schrödinger Equation vs. R Process**
- Deterministic Schrödinger evolution vs. non-deterministic R process
- Curious implications for the 'convenience' view of R

**Linearity of U and State Transformations**
- Finite time transformations: exponentiated infinitesimal Hamiltonian actions
- Preserves complex-vector space structure of state space W

**Issues with U being the Whole Story**
- Superposition problem in thought experiment involving two detectors
  * Linearity leads to coexistence of both detector responses
- 'Many worlds' view as a potential solution but not 'the whole story'
- Issues regarding conscious perception of individual detector responses

**Importance for Conventional Formalism and Future Theories**
- Conventional formalism prescriptions should be accorded with, even if improved theories are needed.

---

### 22.3: Unitary structure, Hilbert space, Dirac notation

**Unitary Structure in Quantum Mechanics:**
* The 'unitary' aspect of Schrödinger evolution refers to the preservation of norm (||ψ||) during temporal evolution.
* The norm is a positive real number associated with any acceptable quantum state ψ, determined by integrals over all possible positions of a particle.
* In multiple particle systems or entities, the notion of norm plays a crucial role in defining probabilities and preserving during evolution.
* A Hilbert space is a complex vector space with a scalar product operation whose values are complex numbers, satisfying certain algebraic properties.
* Normalizable wave functions form a subspace called Hilbert space within the state space W.
* The adjective 'unitary' signifies that this norm is preserved throughout evolution.
* Paul Dirac introduced a valuable notational framework using ket vectors |ϕ⟩ and bra vectors 〈ψ| for representing states in Hilbert space H.
* Orthogonal states have zero scalar product (〈ϕ|ψ⟩ = 0), while the action of some linear operator L on a state vector |ψ⟩ is written as L |ψ⟩.
* The adjoint (star) operation applied to a linear operator L results in its Hermitian conjugate, which is used in defining scalar products between bra and ket vectors.

---

### 22.4: Unitary evolution: Schrödinger and Heisenberg

**Unitary Evolution: Schrödinger and Heisenberg**

**Preserving Scalar Product in Schrödinger Evolution:**
- Preserve scalar product between elements of Hilbert space (HH)
- Schrödinger evolution is linear, so it only requires preserving norm and scalar product
- Minimal requirements for quantum Hamiltonian H:
  - Keeps us in the Hilbert space
  - Hermitian
  - Positive-definite (optional)
- Preserving scalar products using Leibniz property:
  $$
  \frac{d\langle \phi|\psi\rangle}{dt} = 0
  $$
- Implies that $\langle \phi|\psi\rangle$ remains unchanged for all time
- Linear action of Schrödinger evolution on Hilbert space is unitary

**Heisenberg Picture:**
- Alternative way to represent quantum system's evolution
- State considered constant in time, while time-evolution applies to dynamical variables
- Heisenberg state does not change as time passes
- Requires dynamical variables to evolve compensatingly for algebraic procedures to follow through
- Technical advantages in some contexts but doesn't help interpretative puzzles of quantum mechanics
- Historical reason for existence: Schrödinger picture proposed later by Heisenberg and fully formulated by Dirac.

**Relativistic Invariance:**
- Neither Heisenberg nor Schrödinger pictures are relativistically invariant
- Hybrid 'interaction picture' sometimes preferred in quantum field theory contexts
- Possibility of preferring one formalism over another when changes are introduced into quantum theory.

---

### 22.5: Quantum ‘observables’

**Quantum Observables and Measurements**

**Observables**:
- Represented by linear operators (e.g., position or momentum)
- Effect a linear transformation on Hilbert space (H)
- Eigenvectors correspond to distinct eigenvalues, which may be real or complex numbers
- Requirement of orthogonality between eigenvectors for normal operators

**Measurable Quantities**:
- Observables provide a measure of some physical property
- States with definite values for observables are eigenstates of the corresponding operator

**Hermitian vs. Normal Operators**:
- Conventional quantum mechanics demands Hermitian (self-adjoint) operators
- However, complex eigenvalues can occur in classical physics
- Normal operators required to ensure orthogonality between alternative states after measurement

**Probabilities of Measurement Outcomes**:
- Probability depends on the quantum states before and after measurement, not the measured eigenvalue or other aspects of the observable
- Probability given by **|〈ψ∣ϕ〉|^2**, where |ψ⟩ and |ϕ⟩ are normalized (or adjusted for non-normalized states)

---

#### Quantum Mechanics: Basis Transformations and Eigenvalues of Hermitian Operators

**Key Concepts:**
* Superposition and probability amplitudes: a state never jumps directly to an orthogonal state due to their complex weighting factors called amplitudes, which are sometimes referred to as probability amplitudes. The probabilities of obtaining specific states are determined by taking the squared moduli of these amplitudes.
* Normal operator Q: possesses eigenstates that form an orthonormal basis for Hilbert space H. An orthonormal basis is a set of elements e1, e2, e3… in H, where every element ψ can be expressed as a linear combination (w1, w2, w3…) using complex 'cartesian coordinates'.
* Position and momentum states: they are not normalizable and don't belong to Hilbert space but form an orthonormal basis when passing from position representation to momentum representation involves changing the basis in Hilbert space.

**Question Answers:**

**Q: Prove that any eigenvalue of a Hermitian operator Q is real.** (Answer not provided)

* Hint: Consider the expression 〈ψ |(Q * – I) (Q – λI) ψ〉.
* Use algebraic properties of 〈| 〉 as in Exercise [22.2] to show this.

---

### 22.6: YES/NO measurements

**Yes/No Measurements and Projectors in Quantum Mechanics**

**Concepts:**
- Operators such as position or momentum have non-normalizable eigenstates with zero probability
- Preferable to use observables like yes/no questions (eigenvalues of 1 for YES, 0 for NO)
- Described by projectors: self-adjoint, squares to itself
- Important in one-dimensional and higher dimensions for degenerate eigenvalues

**Issues with Degenerate Eigenvalues:**
- Obtaining result of measurement does not determine state the system jumps to
- Projection postulate resolves this issue by projecting state to eigenspace of measured observable's eigenvalue

**Projectors:**
- Can be used to express projection aspect of measurement postulate
- One can choose a projector E with same eigenspace as Q for YES/NO measurements
- Resulting state jumps to E|ψ⟩ after measurement

**Geometrical Interpretation:**
- Projection postulate decomposes |ψ⟩ into two orthogonal parts: one in the yes space and another in the no space
- The probabilities of these alternatives are given by the factor that reduces the state's norm (squared length) during projection.

**Additional Information:**
- A projector is self-adjoint, meaning it equals its own adjoint (Hermitian conjugate).
- Degeneracy: If an observable Q has more than one eigenvector with the same eigenvalue q, then it's degenerate.

---

### 22.7: Null measurements

**Null Measurements and Helicity**
- Some physicists have expressed doubts about the projection postulate, arguing that it may be unobservable due to entanglement with measuring apparatus
- Null (interaction-free) measurements: photon goes through a beam splitter and can end up in either transmitted or reflected state
  - Detector placed where it would have detected photon if it had taken the other path
    * If detector doesn't detect photon, we know that the photon ended up in the reflected state |ρ) even though it didn't interact with the measuring apparatus at all
- Impressive use of null measurements: Elitzur–Vaidman bomb test
  - Detector C, attached to a bomb, may or may not be inserted into a Mach–Zehnder interferometer
    * If detector B receives the photon (without the bomb exploding), we know that C is in place even though it hasn't encountered the photon
- Degeneracy issue resolved through proper use of projection postulate
  - Photons possess spin, which behaves differently than massive particles due to being massless
    * Spin is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics that will be discussed further in §§22.8–11

---

#### Quantum Polarization Behavior and Reflection of Photons

**Massless Particles and Spin**
- Massless particles, such as photons, have spin only about their direction of motion
- Magnitude of spin (|s|) is always the same for a given type of massless particle
- If helicity s is non-zero, spin can be right-handed (s > 0: positive helicity) or left-handed (s < 0: negative helicity)
- Photon has helicity ±1; gravitons have helicity ±2; neutrinos have spin ½ and their antiparticles have helicity – ½
- Helicity values are integral or half-integer multiples of h/2π
- Massless particles are said to have spin j, where |s| = j (or jhbar)

**Polarization States of Photons**
- Circularly polarized states are helicity states
- Right-handed: s = 1; left-handed: s = –1
- Other possible polarizations are linear combinations of right- and left-handed states

**Reflection of Polarized Photons**
- When a photon impinges perpendicularly on a mirror, reflected state has opposite helicity to emitted one
- Transmitted state has the same polarization as emitted photon
- If detector fails to detect right-handed photon (non-detection), it must have jumped to left-handed reflected state

**Projection Postulate**
- In Fig. 22.8, source emits a right-handed photon and detector fails to record it, indicating that state has jumped to the reflected left-handed state
- Full projection postulate is required for this conclusion as there's degeneracy in both NO (transmitted beam) and YES (reflected beam) cases
- The actual starting state |τ+ + ρ–> is needed to determine where the state jumps upon measurement, when non-detected.

---

### 22.8: Spin and spinors

**Spin and Spinors**

**Preparation for Chapter 23**:
- This section discusses spin, a concept related to angular momentum conservation in quantum mechanics
- Spin is important as it leads to the elegant revealing aspects of quantum mechanics

**Spin**:
- In quantum mechanics, spin refers to the angular momentum about a particle's center of mass
- Rotational symmetry gives rise to **angular momentum conservation**, similar to momentum conservation
- For a massive particle, rotations are those that constitute the rotation group O(3) around its location
- Angular momentum components are represented as iħ times the generators of infinitesimal rotations about corresponding axes

**Commutation Rules**:
- The angular momentum components L1, L2, and L3 do not all commute due to non-Abelian nature of SO(3) Lie algebra
- These commutation rules are related to the components of angular momentum through iħ

**Representation of Angular Momentum**:
- Angular momentum components act as linear operators on the Hilbert space H, leading to a representation of the Lie algebra of SO(3) in terms of linear transformations of H

**Spinors and 2-spinor Notation**:
- The 2-component wavefunction ψA is called a spinor and its index A is referred to as a 2-spinor index
- This notation forms the basis of a powerful formalism for quantum mechanics, particularly in relativistic physics and general relativity

**Unit of ħ**:
- The author adopts the convenient assumption that units have been chosen so that ħ = 1
- This can be maintained by replacing any quantity scaling as the qth power of mass with ħ–q times that quantity, if required.

#### Quantum Spin and Angular Momentum in Particle Physics: Representation and State Decomposition

**Spin Representation of Particles**

**SO(3) Representations**:
- All representations can be built up as direct sums of irreducible representations (see §13.7)
- General representation expressed as collection of symmetric wavefunctions, each with n indices for spin

**Particle Spin Types**:
- **Scalar Particle (Spin 0)**: No indices
- **Fermions (Half-integral spin)**: Odd number of indices, referred to as spinorial objects
- **Bosons (Integral spin)**: Even number of indices

**Spin-Tensor Notation**:
- Referred to as n-index spinor when n is odd and spin is half-odd integral
- Total spin J2 determines eigenvalue j (j+1), the 'squared length' of the 3-vector operator J = (L1, L2, L3)
- J2 commutes with each component L1, L2, L3 of angular momentum

**Labeling Quantum States**:
- Form complete set of commuting operators to delineate states
- Labeled by j and m, eigenvalues of J2 and L3 respectively (see §22.12)
- Take j ≥ 0 and –j ≤ m ≤ j, both half integers for spinorial case or integers

**Arbitrary Direction**:
- Choice of upward direction is arbitrary, corresponds to an up/down basis
- Any other spatial direction can be chosen instead

**Additional Exercises**:
- Explain more fully why the correct answer is given by 'projection' (22.17)
- Use quaternions to check this (22.18)
- Check this using explicit calculations (22.19, 22.20)

4. **Riemann Sphere Representation**
   - Sphere representing distinct ratios z:w
   - Each point labels a distinct spin state
5. **Stereographic Projection:**
   * Points on the sphere correspond to distinct ratios z:w
   * Ratio z/w is represented by complex number u in equatorial plane
6. **Measurements and Probabilities:**
   - Measurement E↗ asks if spin is in direction ↗
     * YES: probability = |w|² / (|w|² + |z|²)
   - Probability directly related to geometry of sphere (length A′C/diameter AA′)
7. **Complex Numbers and Geometry:**
   * Connection between complex-number ratios in quantum mechanics and directions in space
8. **Metric Sphere vs Conformal Sphere:**
   - More structure: 'antipodal point' part of sphere's structure, rotations as symmetries
   - Loss of conformal motions (aberration effects) exhibited on celestial sphere.

#### Quantum Spin States and Riemann Sphere Geometry in Physics

**Quantum Measurement and Riemann Sphere (2-State System)**

**Background:**
- Application of Riemann sphere in quantum mechanics
  * Not restricted to spin, but general for a two-state system
  * Provides 'quantum spread' between classical alternatives
  * Often viewed as formal by physicists due to unobservable overall phase and complex coefficients

**Riemann Sphere Geometry:**
- Relates complex numbers (amplitudes) to spatial properties of spin
  * General spin states of a higher-spin massive particle
  * Photon polarization: elliptical, circular, or plane

**Probabilities in YES/NO Measurement:**
- Point B on the Riemann sphere represents initial state
- Projecting B orthogonally to C on axis A′A defines probabilities of YES and No
  * Probability of YES: length A′C = (1 + cos θ)
  * Probability of No: length CA = (1 – cos θ)

**Relation between Complex Coefficients and Spatial Properties:**
- In some situations, Riemann sphere's geometry connects complex numbers to spatial properties directly

**Photon Polarization:**
- General polarization state: |ϕ〉 = w|+〉 + z|–〉
- Elliptical polarization: electric and magnetic vectors trace an ellipse in wave front plane
  * Plane polarization: ellipse squashes down to line segment
  * Circular polarization: ellipse becomes a circle
- Photon's wavefunction exhibits behavior of this kind

**Riemann Sphere Representation:**
- North pole represents positive helicity state |+〉, south pole for negative helicity state |–〉
  * Assume photon travels upwards in direction of |+〉
- Stokes vector: q = (z/w)1/2
  * Represents the general polarization state w|+〉 + z|–〉
- Project circle orthogonally to equatorial plane to obtain required polarization ellipse and orientation.

### 22.10: Higher spin: Majorana picture

**Spin States and Majorana Description**

**Spin Tensors**:
- Can be described by a symmetric n-index spin-tensor ψAB…F
- Has a 'canonical decomposition' into symmetrized products of 1-index spinors, up to scale factors and orderings

**Representation on Riemann Sphere**:
- The spin-tensor can be represented on the Riemann sphere as an unordered set of n points (i.e., n directions in space)
- This representation is called the **Majorana description**

**Majorana Description for Standard Basis States**:
- In Majorana description, the standard basis states have points all at either north or south pole: |↑↑↑…↑〉, |↓↑↑…↑〉, ↓↓↑…↑〉,…, |↓↓↓…↓〉

**Relation to Stern-Gerlach Apparatus**:
- The **m-values** measured by a Stern-Gerlach apparatus are eigenvalues of L3 (magnetic moment along the z-axis)
- These states are all orthogonal to one another and can be distinguished by their m-values: j, j – 1, j – 2,…, –j

**Orthogonality Conditions**:
- The orthogonality conditions for general Majorana descriptions are complicated
- However, a Majorana state with direction ↗ is orthogonal to the state |↙↙↙…↙〉 (opposite direction)
- If ↗ appears in the Majorana description with multiplicity r, it is orthogonal to any other spin n state with opposing direction ↙ with multiplicity at least n – r + 1

**Alternative Procedure for Representing Spin States**:
- Physicists often use **harmonic analysis** instead of the procedure outlined above
- This is an important topic, and the next section provides a brief discussion

**Additional Exercises**:
- Verify all claims made in the text using the provided hints and references
- Consider proving the 'canonical decomposition' theorem using the fundamental theorem of algebra
- Apply the results to the orthogonality of eigenstates of L3

### 22.11: Spherical harmonics

**Spherical harmonics**

**Background**
- Theory of vibrations: infinite degrees of freedom
- Normal modes, each with a unique frequency (normal frequency)
- Classification of harmonics: Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenfunctions on the unit sphere S2

**Classifying Spherical Harmonics**
1. Eigenstates of Laplacian operator ∇² on S2
2. Discrete family for compact objects with a discrete spectrum of normal frequencies
3. On a sphere, spherical harmonics correspond to vibrational modes and are called eigenfunctions
4. Spherical harmonics are labeled by j (integer) and m (-j ≤ m ≤ j)
5. Similarities between spherical harmonics and angular momentum operators J² and L³
6. Identification of wave functions for particles with integral spin j

8. Functions on the sphere S2 have a dependence on unit tangent vectors at each point (spinorial)
9. Closely related to 2-spinor description of spin states introduced in §22.8 and used for Majorana representation in §22.10

**Classifying Spherical Harmonics Using Laplacian Operator on S2**
10. To classify spherical harmonics, we look for eigenstates of the Laplacian operator ∇² defined on the unit sphere S2
11. The possible eigenvalues are numbers -j (j + 1)
12. Eigenfunctions: spherical harmonics
13. Demand that harmonics be eigenfunctions of ∂/∂ϕ operator (which commutes with ∇²)
14. Possible eigenvalues for ∂/∂ϕ are im, where m lies in the range -j ≤ m ≤ j
15. Examples of such eigenfunctions include: Φ = 1 (j = m = 0), Φ = cosθ (j = 1, m = 0), Φ = e±iϕ sin θ (j = 1, m = ±1), etc.

**Relation to Angular Momentum Operators J² and L³**
16. Remarkable similarity between eigenvalues j(j+1) for total angular momentum operator J² and spherical harmonics
17. Eigenstates of L³ correspond to harmonics that are eigenfunctions of ∂Φ/∂ϕ
18. Identification of wave functions for particles with integral spin j as spherical harmonics
19. Generalization to spin-weighted spherharmonics for half-odd integer spins
20. Functions on the sphere S2 have a dependence on unit tangent vectors at each point (spinorial)
21. Closely related to 2-spinor description of spin states introduced in §22.8 and used for Majorana representation in §22.10.

#### Exploring Spherical Harmonics via Spinors: Quantum vs Classical Differences

**Spinor Description of Spherical Harmonics**
* Conveys outline of spinor approach to spherical harmonics
* Provides effective, albeit unconventional route
* Spin-tensor quantities ψ AB...F provide irreducible representation space for SO(3)
* Majorana description obtained through considerations of zeros in decomposition of ψ AB...F
* Valuable insights into spherical harmonics can be gained using this approach
* Simpler to use but less familiar than standard methods
* Importance in various fields, such as classical physics and cosmology
* Contrast between quantum and classical manifestations of spherical harmonics: no direct correlation between j (or ℓ) value and spherical symmetry
* Majorana points randomly distributed for large angular momentum systems in quantum mechanics do not resemble classical systems with large angular momentum
* Discrepancy between these two pictures due to the fact that most large quantum states do not behave like classical ones
* Harmonic analysis on non-compact spaces can get complicated, capturing only a small proportion of relevant functions without complete system of harmonics.

### 22.12: Relativistic quantum angular momentum

**Relativistic Quantum Angular Momentum**

**Classical Expressions**:
- Classical expressions described in §18.7 for angular momentum and mass center movement
- Antisymmetric 6-tensor quantity Mab describes an object's angular momentum and mass-center movement

**Quantum Mechanics**:
- How to deal with these quantum mechanically?
- Quantum notions of energy and momentum represent the generators of time- and space-translational motions
- Components of 6-angular momentum Mab represent the generators of Lorentz rotational motions in Minkowski space

**Generators of Poincaré Motions**:
- Generators of translational Poincaré motions are components of 4-momentum vector pa
- Remaining components of Mab generate Lorentz velocity transformations, referring to uniform motion of mass center

**Commutation Laws**:
- These commutation laws define the Lie algebra of the Poincaré group
- Look simpler in diagrammatic notation (Fig. 22.18)

**Basis for States**:
- For non-relativistic angular momentum, a basis is described by eigenvalues j(j+1) and m of commuting observables J2 and L3
- Finding such a complete set of commuting observables (Casimir operators) is important in quantum mechanics
- The Casimir operator for 3-dimensional angular momentum is the scalar operator L·L

**Pauli–Lubanski Spin Vector**:
- Defined by the quantity S, where Levi-Civita's antisymmetrical εabcd was defined in §19.2
- Sa = 0 for a single classical structureless particle
- Sa may not vanish for a total system of two or more particles
- For a single particle with spin, the angular momentum Mab does not have this simple form, and there is an additional spin term

**Casimir Operators**:
- The Casimir operators (pa·pa = c4µ2 and Sa·Sa = –µ2J2) are independent and define the Poincaré group's Lie algebra.

#### Understanding Relativistic Spin, Helicity, and Commuting Operators in Quantum Mechanics

**Commuting Operators in Relativistic Spin Theory**

**Six Independent Operators**:
- Choose p1, p2, p3 and a component S of spin vector to complete six commuting operators
- These choices are equivalent to including translations in time and space in non-relativistic case
- In relativistic case, J2 is not directly obtained, but rather J2 = -c/(pa.pa) * Sa.Sa
- Assumes rest mass µ does not vanish; for massless cases, use helicity s defined by Sa = s*pa

**Massless Case**:
- Four independent commuting operators: s, p1, p2, p3
- Handling massless case neatly is best done using twistor theory (discussed in §33.6)

**Commutators of Angular Momentum Operators**:
- Commutators given by §22.8 for 3-dimensional angular momentum are contained within these operators

**Properties of These Operators**:
- Work out details, assuming discrete eigenvalues first, then degenerate eigenvalues
- Show that these operators commute with pa and Mab
- Explain how Sa and pa can be both orthogonal and proportional

**Hints**:
- Express eigenvectors of A in terms of eigenvectors of B for degenerate eigenvalues
- Look at §22.13 to understand the commutation relation between these operators and momentum and angular momentum operators.

### 22.13: The general isolated quantum object

**Isolated Quantum Objects in Quantum Mechanics**

**External Characterization**:
- Overall mass/energy
- Momentum
- Location and movement of mass center
- Angular momentum

**Internal Workings**:
- Constituent particles
- Particular nature
- Nature of forces between them
- Geometrical relations

**Relatively Unchanged Internal Coordinates**:
- Distance out from mass center
- Angle that parts make with one another
- Distances of parts from one another

**Symmetry Operators and Commutation**:
- Symmetry operator S acts on ψ according to S|ψ⟩ = S|ψ⟩
- If Q is unchanged by S, then SQ = QS

**Separating Internal and External Degrees of Freedom**:
- Internal degrees of freedom can be separated from external parameters
- Usually assumed that system is in an eigenstate of complete set of external observables (energy, momentum)

**Classical Analogy for Normal Modes**:
- Classical analysis of small oscillations around equilibrium
- Eigenvalues ω² of matrix W = PQ give classical normal frequencies

**Quantum Mechanics and Zero-Point Energy**:
- Quantum energy eigenstates: 0, ħω, 2ħω, 3hbarω, ...
- Additional contribution (called zero-point energy)
- Applicable to bosons in quantum field theory

**Limitations and Need for Detailed Knowledge**:
- Approximations when higher-order terms become important
- Detailed knowledge of interactions needed for more thorough analysis.

#### Quantum Mechanics: Eigenstates, Angular Momentum, & Spectral Lines

**Eigenstates of Angular Momentum**
- **Description**: Eigenstates of angular momentum are wavefunctions that are spherical harmonics in their angular dependence.
- **Quantum Numbers**: Energy eigenvalue `E` and angular momentum eigenvalue `j` (along with `m`) can be used as quantum numbers to label the different states.
- **Hydrogen Atom**: In the case of the hydrogen atom, the energy eigenvalue `E` determines the total angular momentum eigenvalue `j`, but not vice versa.
- **Quantum Mechanics vs. Bohr Theory**: The original Bohr theory of the atom worked remarkably well, but was unsupported by the theoretical underpinnings of subsequent quantum mechanics. More accurate theories (e.g., relativistic electron, quantum field theory) are required for more complicated systems.
- **Excited States and Decay**: If an atom is in an excited state, there is a finite probability it will drop into the ground state with the emission of one or more photons. Free atoms/molecules tend to be found in their ground states or near them.
- **Photon Emission**: The frequency `v` of a photon emitted when an atom drops from one state to another is fixed by Planck's equation and energy conservation. These frequencies (spectral lines) have been observed, explaining the richness of information in these patterns.
- **Importance of Compact Spaces**: Discrete quantum numbers like `j` and `m` arise due to the compactness or periodicity of some spaces, such as the sphere of spatial directions for angular momentum. Without this, the general formalism of quantum mechanics would not have provided the striking discreteness that started the subject off.

#### Quantum Mechanics with Spherical Harmonics and Energy Level Transitions

**Spinor Algebra and Geometry**
- Spinor indices can be "raised" or "lowered" using the following scheme:
  - ξ1 = ξ0
  - ξ0 = –ξ1

**Quantum Numbers**
- Refers to the possible discrete eigenvalues of significant quantum observables, such as angular momentum, charge, baryon number, etc. used for particle classification.
- **Section 22.12**: Requires more than basic considerations for proper relativistic quantum mechanics in Chapters 24–26.

**Independence of Commuting Operators**
- Refers to functional independence, not just simple commutation (see Note 22.26).
- Not all functions related by J2, (J2)3, and cos(J2) are independent Casimir operators; they have some overlap.

**Counting Degrees of Freedom**
- Strictly refers to local solutions of partial differential equations in quantum mechanics problems.
- Compactness requirements on solution space may severely restrict eigenvalues, confounding degree of freedom counting.

**General Relativity vs. Special Relativity**
- "Relative" is taken in the sense of special relativity.

**Hamiltonian Freedom**
- Adding a constant to the Hamiltonian allows redefining the zero of energy (cf. Exercise [24.2] of §24.3). This addition of ħω is sometimes considered of no direct physical relevance.

**Creation Operators in Heisenberg Picture**
- The quantities η = (2mħω)–1/2(p + iq), in the Heisenberg picture, play the role of creation operators (see §26.2).

## 23. The entangled quantum world 
###  23.1: Quantum mechanics of many-particle systems

**Quantum Mechanics of Many-Particle Systems**

**New Features in Quantum Behavior:**
- **Entanglement**: A system containing several separate particles must be treated as a single holistic unit due to quantum entanglement.
- Identical particles are automatically entangled with each other, but can occur in two distinct ways depending on the nature of the particle.

**Description of Many-Particle Systems:**
- **Quantum-Hamiltonian approach**: Provides Schrödinger equation for evolution of quantum state vector Ψ
- One state vector describes entire system, not separate wavefunctions for each particle
- Position-space representation: Single state vector can be thought of as a wave function Ψ on configuration space of all particles and depends on time t.

**Time Coordinate in Quantum Theory:**
- In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, only one time coordinate exists for all particles despite each having independent position coordinates.
- This is a limiting approximation to relativistic theory where space and time are treated equally by each particle.

**Treatment of Many-Particle Systems in Standard Non-Relativistic Schrödinger Picture:**
- Single Hamiltonian with momenta for all particles, replaced by partial differentiation operators acting on wavefunction Ψ.
- All these operators must act on the same wave function.

---

### 23.2: Hugeness of many-particle state space

**Hugeness of Many-Particle State Space**

**Importance of Understanding Complexity**
- Simple last requirement: each particle has own separate wavefunction
- Neclearates need for understanding freedom in complex scalar field
- Visualization challenge with increasing number of particles (n) and dimensions

**Complex Scalar Fields vs. Quantum Mechanical Description**
- Freedom in choosing n complex numbers per point = ∞2n∞3 for n separate wavefunctions
- However, actual quantum wavefunction consists of one complex function with 3n real variables
- Larger freedom: ε2∞ instead of previous estimation

**Toy Universe Example**
- Discrete model with 10 points in space (0 to 9)
- Wavefunction consists of complex numbers assigned to each pairing of particles' placements
- State-space grows exponentially as number of particles increase: H 100, H 1000 for two particles; H 10000 for three etc.
- Distinct particles needed for calculation purposes later on

**Notation Change**
- Replaces "𝔼 3" with actual number of points in toy universe (10) as upper 'n' in notation
- Implies state space now has dimensions H 10n instead of H 10n for separate wavefunctions.

---

### 23.3: Quantum entanglement

**Quantum Entanglement and Bell Inequalities**

**Entanglement Relations**:
- Expressing relationships between particles in a quantum system
- First made explicit by Schrödinger (1935)
- Lead to puzzling phenomena like Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) effects
- Hard to demonstrate experimentally in a convincing way

**Entanglement and Information**:
- Almost the entire "information" in the wavefunction is concerned with such matters
- Puzzle about how present-day quantum formalism should move forward
- Potential power of quantum computing, an active research subject

**EPR Effects and Bell Inequalities**:
- EPR situation: Pair of spin particles travel away from each other to separate detectors
- Problem: Can predictions of quantum mechanics be reproduced using a model where particles are unconnected classical-like entities?
- Bell's theorem: Cannot reproduce quantum expectations with this model, as it violates Bell inequalities
- Demonstrates presence of quantum entanglement effects which cannot be explained by models treating particles as independent objects

**Bell Inequalities**:
- Involve a pair of spin particles going to separate detectors
- Some versions do not require probabilities, only "yes/no" issues

**Tensor Product Notation**:
- Quantum system with two parts: |ψ⟩ and |ϕ⟩
- Product of these together: |ψ⟩|ϕ⟩ (also written as Hp ⊗ Hq)
- Many ways to express this product, depending on the particular splitting of Hilbert space
- Unentangled states always split in this way; entangled states are more general entities

---

### 23.4: Bohm-type EPR experiments

**Bohm-type EPR Experiments**

**Initial State**:
- The two separated spin particles must constitute a state of spin 0
- Achieved by the state `|Ω⟩` of spin 0: `|Ω⟩ = |↑⟩|↓⟩ – |↑⟩|↓⟩`
- Notation used in literature: `|↑L⟩|↓R⟩ – |↓L⟩|↑R⟩`

**Entangled State**:
- Clearly an entangled state, cannot be rewritten as `|α⟩|β⟩` with localized states

**Implications of Entangled State**:
- If measuring the left-hand particle's spin in the 'up' direction, the entire state is projected into `|↑⟩|↓⟩` if YES and `–|↓⟩|↑⟩` if NO
- Result is unentangled at the measurement location, but entangled with the measuring apparatus
- Colleague at right-hand detector will obtain opposite result upon measuring PR spin in the same direction as the initial measurement

**Joint Probabilities**:
- Joint probabilities for YY, YN, NY, NN depend on the angle between measurement directions
- For 45° angle: agreement around 15%
- For 135° angle: agreement around 85%

**Stapp's Example**:
- Measurement directions are vertically up or horizontal (perpendicular), colleague measures in the plane with different angles
- Three possibilities for 45° between measurement directions, probability of agreement under 15%
- One possibility for 135° between measurement directions, probability of agreement over 85%
- Decision on measurement direction can be made even after particles are in flight

**Experiment Setup**:
- Source sends particles to each participant (I and colleague) randomly oriented
- When comparing notes later, less than 15% agreement is found between results

---

#### Exploring Quantum Entanglement through Thought Experiment

**Experiment Design and Quantum Entanglement**

**Imagining Experiment with Colleague on Titan**:
- Author imagines receiving one component of EPR particle pair in Earth
- Colleague receives other component on Titan, equidistant between receivers
- Particles travel at speed of light, 45 minutes to decide detector orientations

**Classical vs. Quantum Assumptions**:
- If particles behave like classical entities with no prior knowledge:
  - Change in measurement orientation should not affect colleague's results
  - Agreement between original and altered measurements would be <15% for both parties
- If particles are entangled and change orientations together:
  - Quantum mechanics predicts >85% agreement
  - Particle pair must provide correct joint probabilities for all detector combinations

**Experimental Limitations**:
- Classical-like assumptions contradict quantum expectations
- Experiments using photon polarization have confirmed Bell inequality violations, vindicating quantum mechanics
- Direct entanglement over Earth–Saturn distances not observed yet but possible with recent experiments.

**Exercises**:
- Normalizing vector |Ω〉 if |↑〉 and |↓〉 are normalized (question [23.2])
  - Factor required for normalization
- Proving that combination of anti-symmetrical vectors must be a scalar to have spin 0 (question [23.3])
- Showing why |Ω〉 has spin 0 using index notation and confirming parenthetic comment (question [23.4])
- Calculating expression for |Ω〉 directly (question [23.5]).

### 23.5: Hardy’s EPR example: almost probability-free

**Hardy's EPR Example: Almost Probability-Free**
* Lucien Hardy's beautiful example of a spin measurement experiment with two independent selectors (the author and their colleague)
* Source emits particle pairs in a state of spin 1, not combined state of spin 0 as before
* Crucial new feature: orthogonality relations between initial state |←↗〉 and basis states
* **Key 'YES/NO' properties:** (0), (1), (2), and (3)
  * (0): Sometimes both obtain NO for ↑ measurements
  * (1): If author obtains NO for ↑, colleague must obtain YES for →
  * (2): If colleague obtains NO for ↑, author must obtain YES for →
  * (3): Author never obtains YES for a → measurement when colleague has obtained YES for a → measurement
* Quantum mechanical probability of both obtaining NO answers to a ↑ measurement is exactly **8.33%**, while Hardy's optimal value is close to **9.017%**
* Why these results cannot be contrived by two separate non-communicating entities without foreknowledge:
  * To provide simultaneous NO answers for both parties, they must be prepared jointly
  * Careful preparation required to maintain the same result for specific events and measurements (YES instead of NO or vice versa)
  * Decisions made based on one measurement put them at risk of violating property (3), as both might perform → measurements and obtain forbidden result YES, YES.

### 23.6: Two mysteries of quantum entanglement

**The Two Mysteries of Quantum Entanglement**

**Mystery 1: Understanding and Accepting Quantum Entanglement**
- How to make sense of quantum entanglement?
- Comprehend it within familiar ideas
- Accept it as part of our universe

**Mystery 2: The Odd Absence of Observable Entanglement Effects in Everyday Life**
- Why don't we notice ubiquitous entanglement effects?
- Schrödinger evolution doesn't provide help
- R-process may be the answer with measurements "cutting through" entanglements

**Addressing the Second Mystery: The Role of Measurements in Experiments and Everyday Life**
- Setting up quantum experiments requires unentangled states
- Measurements essential for ensuring uncontaminated state
- Nature continually enacts R-process effects, possibly without conscious intervention or intentions
- Inconclusive resolution to the issue of pervasive entanglement with the rest of the universe

**Relation to the Measurement Problem or Paradox in Quantum Mechanics**
- U/R paradox at the center of interpreting quantum mechanics
- The need for understanding when and how to apply U and R processes.

---

### 23.7: Bosons and fermions

**Bosons vs Fermions**

**Distinguishing Features:**
- **Bosons**: integral spin, symmetric wave functions
- **Fermions**: half-odd integer spin, antisymmetric wave functions
- Both: can be treated as individual particles or composite particles (e.g., photons, mesons, nuclei, atoms)

**Wavefunctions:**
- For a pair of bosons: symmetric in indices (zij = zji)
  - Distinguishable ways: (10 × 11) = 55 complex numbers needed
- For fermions: antisymmetric in arguments
  - Distinguishable ways: (10 × 9) for two, (10 × 9 × 8) for three, etc.
- With more than 5 identical fermions: numbers decrease as n increases
- Pauli exclusion principle: no two identical fermions in the same state

**Implications:**
- Solid materials don't collapse due to the Pauli principle (electrons, protons, neutrons)
- Bosons have a tendency to prefer being in the same state (Bose-Einstein condensation)
  - Superfluids and lasers are examples of this phenomenon
- Cooper pairs in superconductors behave as bosons.

---

### 23.8: The quantum states of bosons and fermions

**Bosons vs Fermions: Quantum States**

**Symmetry and Antisymmetry Requirements:**
- Identical Bosons: wavefunction symmetric under interchange of particles
- Identical Fermions: anti-symmetric under interchange of particles

**Wavefunctions:**
- Labeled by spatial coordinates u, v, ... and discrete parameters α, β, ... for each particle
- Symmetrized/Antisymmetrized states required for bosons/fermions respectively

**Many-Particle States:**
- Identical Bosons: symmetrized product of individual wavefunctions
- Identical Fermions: antisymmetrized state (§12.4)

**Entanglement:**
- Relatively 'harmless' entanglement between identical particles
- Reduces the number of alternatives for a quantum system

**Notes:**
* Bosonic 'entangled' nature of photons used to measure star diameters through Hanbury Brown and Twiss method.
* Overlooked by some physicists initially due to assumptions about photon interference.
* Wedge product notation can be used to represent symmetry and antisymmetry requirements in ket notation (see §11.6).

### 23.9: Quantum teleportation

**Quantum Teleportation: A Mysterious Implication of Quantum Entanglement**

**Background:**
- Concept evokes 'Star Trek' and raises questions about copying unknown quantum states
- Attempts to preserve an individual's identity during teleportation process

**Impossibility of Copying Unknown Quantum States**
- Contradiction with standard U/R quantum mechanics principles
  - Cannot make exact copies or duplicate an unknown state without destroying the original
  - Measurements provide only one bit (binary digit) of information about the state's direction, not its actual value

**Quantum Teleportation: Sending a Quantum State from One Place to Another**
- No classical signal can transmit a quantum state due to potential copying issues
- Ground preparation is required using entangled particles of spin 0
  - Each possesses one member of an EPR pair, kept isolated since five years ago
  - Bringing both particles together retrieves the original state upon return
- Classical radio signal can be sent instead when conditions don't allow for reliable quantum transmission
- The recipient on Titan receives only a classical radio signal but must possess another entangled particle to retrieve the original state.

---

#### Quantum Teleportation and EPR Paradox Demonstrated

**Quantum Teleportation**

**Experiment**:
- Real experiments have been performed confirming expectations of quantum-mechanical teleportation (over distances of the order of metres, not Earth-Saturn spans)
- Quantum cryptography and ideas of quantum computation depend on these principles

**Process**:
1. Particle A (on Earth) is brought together with particle B (on Titan), each having spin 1/2
2. Measurement distinguishes four orthogonal states ("Bell states") of the combined system
3. Result is conveyed to colleague on Titan via a classical signal (0, 1, 2, or 3)
4. Colleague performs specific rotations based on the received measurement result to "teleport" the quantum state from particle A to particle B
5. Only two bits of information are transmitted, but the entire spin direction (ℵ0 bits) can be conveyed
6. This is possible due to an "acausal quanglement link" connecting all relevant particles and the past origin of the EPR pair
7. The issue with this process is that it requires a stretch of time extending 5 years into the past

---

### 23.10: Quanglement

**Quanglement**
- Term proposed for "quantum information" to distinguish it from ordinary information
- Suggests "quantum mechanics" and "entanglement" (which quanglement is all about)
- Not transmittable information, cannot be used to send signals into the past
- Can be used in conjunction with ordinary information channels for certain tasks
- Linked to quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation
- Constrained by light cones like ordinary information links but can "zig-zag backwards and forwards in time"
- Associated with Riemann sphere and spin geometry, reflected at reversal of time direction

**Parametric Down-Conversion Experiment**:
- Quanglement demonstrated through parametric down-conversion process
- Photon pair produced from a laser photon entering non-linear crystal
- Entangled photons have related momenta and polarizations (EPR effect)
- One photon passes through hole, the other through lens to focus at detector
- Detector positions moved, image of hole built up by detecting both photons' positions
- Seems like "mirror at C reflects the photon backwards in time as well as in direction" (quanglement)

---

#### Quantum Nonlocality and Quanglement: Time-Relativity Conflict

**Experiment using an adaptation of Elitzur–Vaidman bomb test**
- Use of a real effect successfully confirmed at University of Baltimore, Maryland
- Two versions of experiment: essential quantum mechanical and non-relativistic perspective

**Non-essential quantum mechanical experiment (Fig. 23.9a)**
- One could imagine a device at C ejecting classical particles pairwise in the appropriate directions, similar results obtained without lensing

**Modification of Elitzur–Vaidman setup for essential quantum mechanical experiment (Fig. 23.9b)**
- Only one photon at a time can register at photographic plate B if interference is destroyed when alternative route misses hole at C
- EPR effect application and relativity issue discussion

**Ordinary EPR effect description**
- Imagining a reference frame with time coordinate t providing parallel time slices through spacetime
- Normal procedure: assume reduction of state occurs when one member is measured, later measurement looks at unentangled state instead of entangled one

**Relativity perspective challenge (Fig. 23.10)**
- Conflict between relativity and objectivity of state reduction
- Two incompatible views regarding which observer effected the reduction and observed reduced state after reduction

**Quanglement perspective**
- Not correct to think of one measurement as causing reduction, another as measuring reduced state
- Quanglement provides a connection between events without carrying information or respecting causality constraints
- Role of quanglement in addressing quantum measurement issue not yet clear
- Connection with twistor theory ideas more promising and briefly examined in §33.2.

## 24. Dirac’s electron and antiparticles 
###  24.1: Tension between quantum theory and relativity

**Key Concepts:**
- **Quantum mechanics vs. relativity**: profound issues around their interrelation
- **Standard approach in quantum theory**: non-relativistic standpoint, time treated differently from space
- **Asymmetry in quantum theory**: many spatial coordinates for each particle
- **Bringing principles of quantum theory and special relativity together**
  - Results in a theory of quantum fields
  - Antiparticles play a crucial role
- **Challenges:** mathematical inconsistencies, need for 'tricks' to provide meaningful calculations.

**Dirac’s Electron and Antiparticles:**
- Dirac insights into the mathematical description of electrons
- Quantum field theory discussed in Chapter 26
- Recent attempts to move forward in fundamental physics take some tricks as genuinely unravelling Nature's secrets, while others might not be fully resolved or understood.

**Tension between quantum mechanics and relativity:**
- Longstanding issue that has guided particle physics into more elaborate mathematical schemes
- Strictly speaking, quantum field theory is mathematically inconsistent in many relevant instances
- Challenging judgement: stop-gap procedures vs profound truths significant to Nature.

---

### 24.2: Why do antiparticles imply quantum field?

**Antiparticles and Quantum Fields**

**Reason for Antiparticles in Quantum Theory:**
- Antiparticles are a consequence of relativistic quantum theory, now well supported by observation
- Presence of antiparticles leads to unlimited potential for particle creation/annihilation
  * Energy can be converted into mass (Einstein's E=mc²)
  * Conserved quantum numbers are maintained during creation and annihilation processes

**Impact on Particle Theory:**
- A theory cannot be a fixed number of particles or single particle theory
- Quantum field theory is needed to accommodate unlimited particle creation

**Particles vs. Fields:**
- Primary entities in quantum field theory are quantum fields, not just particles
- Feynman graph approach offers a strong 'particle-like' perspective on processes

**Reasons for Particle Creation:**
- Energy can be converted into mass (Einstein's E=mc²)
- Additive quantum numbers are conserved during creation process
  * Reversed signs in antiparticles ensure conservation of these quantities

**Creation vs. Annihilation:**
- Particle and its antiparticle can be created out of pure energy
  * Sufficient energy (twice the rest mass/energy) required for both particle and antiparticle creation
- Conversely, particles can annihilate each other with production of energy
  * Minimum energy (twice the rest mass/energy) needed for annihilation process.

### 24.3: Energy positivity in quantum mechanics

**Quantum Mechanics: Energy Positivity**

**The Schrödinger Equation**:
- Describes time evolution of a quantum system with energy E
- Solutions have form `ψ = Ce–iEt/ħ` where C is independent of t

**Importance of Positive Energy**:
- Negative energy states can lead to catastrophic instabilities
- Physical requirement: wavefunction should be expressible as linear combination of positive-energy eigenstates

**Positive Frequency**:
- Functions with negative iE/ħ in the exponent are said to be of **positive frequency**
- Positive frequency property is crucial for a decent wavefunction

**Relationship between Mathematics and Physics**:
- In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, positive frequency tends to come about automatically
- Hamiltonian H = p^2/2µ comes from reasonable physical problems with positive classical energies
- Classical energies are sums of squares and cannot be negative
- Quantum-mechanically, we make the replacement p ≈ -iħ∇

**Riemann Sphere**:
- Geometric interpretation: positive-frequency parts extend into southern hemisphere, negative-frequency parts into northern hemisphere

**Remarkable Relationship**:
- Elegant mathematical property of positive frequency is physically required in quantum mechanics

### 24.4: Difficulties with the relativistic energy formula

**Challenges with Relativistic Energy Formula**

**Importance of Relativistic Expression**:
- Includes both rest energy and kinetic energy terms
- Expressions derived from the relativistic equation: E² = c²µ² + c²p²
- Reassurance that it reduces to Newtonian Hamiltonian with p²/2µ in power series expansion

**Complexities of the Square Root**:
- Difficulty assigning meaning to the expression (µ² - ħ²∂²/_dx²)
- Ambiguities arise due to complex wave functions in quantum mechanics
- Negative energies cannot be ruled out as easily as in non-relativistic cases

**Consequences of Negative Energy States**:
- Possibility of spontaneous transitions leading to catastrophic instability
- In single free particles, no real difficulty due to positive-energy plane waves
- Problems arise when interactions are present

**Paul Dirac's Solution: The Dirac Equation**
- Paul Dirac proposed a solution through his equation for the electron (Dirac equation)
- This eliminated the need for negative energies by incorporating antiparticles into the theory.

**Derivations and Exercises**:
1. Schrödinger's equation derivation:
   - Confirm that energy eigenstates have positive A value
   - Use Green's theorem to show positivity of A for normalizable states
2. Deriving Green's theorem from the fundamental theorem of exterior calculus.
3. Suggestions on approaching the problem using Fourier transforms, power series or contour integrals.

### 24.5: The non-invariance of ∂/∂t

**Non-Invariance of Schrödinger's Equation in Relativity Theory**

**Reasons for Adopting Hamiltonian (µ² + p²)**
- Need to replace standard spacetime 4-momenta by differential operators in Schrödinger's equation
- Time and space get mixed up in relativity theory, so energy and momentum do as well
- Energy is mass and mass is energy - non-invariance of additive mass concept m
- Invariant rest mass µ not conserved or additive, making it a poor choice for Hamiltonian

**Wave Operator (D'Alembertian) from the Squared Rest Energy**
- Obtained by applying quantization trick to squared rest energy µ² = m² – p²
- Can be used as wave equation for relativistic particle in Klein–Gordon equation: (□ + M²)ψ = 0
- Schrödinger himself first proposed this equation, but it is frequently referred to as the Klein–Gordon equation now
- Describes massive spinless particles like mesons in modern quantum field theory

**Dirac's Equation for Electron**
- Argued for a first-order time derivative instead of second-order form in Schrödinger's equation
- Reasoned from requirement that wavefunction provide positive probability density for finding particle at any place.

---

### 24.6: Clifford–Dirac square root of wave operator

**Clifford-Dirac Square Root of Wave Operator**

**Relativity and Dirac's Resolution**:
- Conflict between relativity and need for first-order time derivative
- Dirac found equation of the first order in ∂/∂t by taking square root of wave operator (square root of wave operator is subtly relativistically invariant)

**Non-commuting Quantities**:
- Introduced non-commuting quantities to treat as linear operators acting on wavefunction
- These include position and momentum operators, as well as new 'spin' quantities

**Rediscovery of Clifford Algebras**:
- Dirac rediscovered Clifford algebras encountered in §11.5
- Unaware of William Kingdon Clifford's earlier work on taking square root of Laplacians
- Clifford had already shown a square root of the 3D Laplacian could be obtained using quaternions

**Lorentzian Clifford Algebra**:
- Dirac's Clifford algebra is 'Lorentzian', with temporal gamma having positive square in contrast to standard Clifford algebra negative squares
- Key fact used: wave operator is the square of a first-order operator defined using these Clifford elements

**Notation**:
- Dirac operator represented as A α = gab γ α, where γ α = (γ0, γ1, γ2, γ3) and gab is the metric tensor

---

### 24.7: The Dirac equation

**The Dirac Equation**

**Factorization of wave operator:**
- Using Dirac operator (□ + M²), we can factorize the quantity appearing in the wave equation for an electron:
  *M² = µ² / h²*
  - The Dirac equation is then given by: (γ⋅∂/∂t + iM)ψ = 0
    *Or, reinstating h by writing it in terms of rest-mass µ:* (γ⋅∂/∂t + iħM)ψ = 0

**Advantages of Dirac equation:**
- First-order in ∂/∂t
- Can be written as a Schrödinger equation with a Hamiltonian operator
- Relativistically invariant

**New degrees of freedom:**
- The Dirac equation introduces strange non-commuting Clifford algebra elements (γa) that act on the wavefunction ψ
- These new degrees of freedom describe the spin of the electron

**Price paid for relativistic invariance:**
- The appearance of these non-commuting Clifford algebra elements γa
- New physical purpose: describe the electron's spin

**Factorization bargain:**
- A theory that precisely describes the electron's spin
- Accurately accounts for interaction with electromagnetic fields, including subtle terms arising from relativistic motion and magnetic moments
- The observed value of the magnetic moment of the electron is close to Dirac's original approximation (except for a small discrepancy explained by quantum electrodynamics)

---

### 24.8: Dirac’s route to the positron

**Dirac's Route to the Positron**

**Anomaly in Dirac Equation**:
- Seeming anomaly regarding electron's spin in Dirac's equation
- Electron should have only 2 independent components based on its spin states
- However, Dirac equation requires 4 independent components for the wave function (ψ)

**Explanation of the Anomaly**:
- In 1925, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit determined that the electron must possess a quantum-mechanical spin
- Pauli showed how to represent spin transformations using Pauli matrices
- These matrices are Clifford algebra elements, but require 2x2 matrices for representation of rotations in 3D space
- In contrast, Dirac's Clifford elements require 4x4 matrices to satisfy the multiplication laws
- Thus, the Dirac electron is a 4-component entity, rather than a 2-component Pauli spinor

**Implications of Dirac Equation**:
- Two electrons can occupy the same orbital by having opposite spins, satisfying the exclusion principle
- Covalent bonds involve pairs of electrons with opposite spins sharing orbitals between atoms
- Mathematically, the Dirac equation only requires half as many solutions compared to a second-order wave equation
- The negative-energy states in the Dirac equation are referred to as the "Dirac sea," with all states occupied by electrons to prevent instability

---

#### Dirac's Theory Predicts Existence of Positrons as Electron's Antiparticles.

**Dirac Sea and Anti-particles**

**Dirac's 'hole' in the Dirac sea**:
- Empty negative-energy state appearing like a positive-charge particle
- Could be occupied by an ordinary electron, resulting in annihilation of electron and positron (antiparticle)
- Energy released in form of photons or electromagnetic radiation

**Dirac's initial thoughts on 'holes'**:
- First thought they might be protons due to mass discrepancy
- Later realized they must be 'antielectrons' (positrons), as their mass equals that of electrons

**Experimental confirmation of positrons**:
- Dirac predicted existence of antiparticles in 1931
- Carl Anderson discovered positron particle in 1932, confirming Dirac's theory

**Relation to quaternions and Clifford elements**:
[Explanation of connection is requested but not provided]

**Matrices not satisfying conditions for Dirac sea**:
- Only 4x4 matrices can satisfy all the conditions
- Explanation of why this is the standard 'gauge prescription' is given in the text

## 25. The standard model of particle physics 
###  25.1: The origins of modern particle physics

**The Origins of Modern Particle Physics**

**The Dirac Equation for the Electron**:
- Provided a turning point for physics in many ways
- In 1928, when Dirac put his equation forward, the only particles known were electrons, protons, and photons
- The free Maxwell equations describe the photon, as was effectively foreseen by Einstein in 1905
- The proton, as well as the electron, seemed to be well-enough described by the Dirac equation
- The **electromagnetic interaction**, describing how electrons and protons are influenced by photons, was excellently handled by Dirac's prescription

**The Need for Strong and Weak Interactions**:
- Most physicists knew that the forces needed to hold the nucleus together (**strong forces**) and the mechanisms responsible for radioactive decay (**weak forces**) could not be accommodated without further advances
- If Dirac-style protons and electrons, interacting merely electro-magnetically, were the only ingredients of atoms, all ordinary nuclei (except the single proton that constitutes the nucleus of hydrogen) would instantly disintegrate due to electrostatic repulsion
- The **neutron** was discovered in 1932, and it was eventually realized that the proton/electron model for the nucleus must be replaced by one in which both protons and neutrons would be present, with a strong proton–neutron interaction holding the nucleus together

**The Study of Radioactivity**:
- Led physicists to an unaccustomed notoriety and influence towards the end of the Second World War and in its aftermath
- The **neutrino**, a mysterious product of radioactivity, was put forward as a tentative hypothesis by Pauli in about 1929 but not observed directly until 1956
- This study would eventually lead to an understanding of the vast array of particles now known, including quarks, gluons, and W and Z bosons

**The Standard Model of Particle Physics**:
- Accommodates almost all observed behavior concerning the vast array of particles now known
- Includes photon, electron, proton, positron, neutron, and neutrino, as well as various other neutrinos, muon, pions, kaons, lambda and sigma particles, and the famously predicted omega-minus particle
- Demands transient entities called **virtual** particles and quantities known as **ghosts** that are even further removed from direct observability
- Proposes unobserved particles like **X-bosons**, **axions**, **photinos**, **squarks**, **gluinos**, **magnetic monopoles**, **dilatons**, etc.

### 25.2: The zigzag picture of the electron

**The Zigzag Picture of the Electron**

**Non-standard Approach to Dirac Equation**:
- Re-examining Dirac equation using '2-spinor notation' introduced in §22.8
- Dirac spinor ψ can be represented as pair of 2-spinors: αA and βA′
- Dirac equation written as an equation coupling these two 2-spinors with a 'coupling constant' M

**Zig and Zag Particles**:
- Each 2-spinor (αA, βA′) can be thought of as a 'particle'
- Zig particle described by αA and zag particle by βA′
- Massless particles traveling at the speed of light, but jiggling back and forth between forward motion and conversion to backward motion
- Spin direction remains constant in electron's rest frame

**Contribution to Feynman Propagator**:
- Each zigzag process contributes to full 'Feynmann propagator' in the manner of Feynman graphs
- Average rate at which zig and zag processes occur is related to mass coupling parameter M
- Infinite quantum superposition of many such processes make up total quantum state of the system

---

#### Discussing the Reality of Quantum Particles in Different Mathematical Descriptions

**Feynman Graphs**
- Each graph represents a component of the electron's motion
- Actual motion is composed of an infinite number of individual processes superposed
- Electron's perceived motion is some sort of "average" or quantum superposition of these

**Zig and Zag Particles**
- Individual Feynman graphs represent zig and zag particle motions
- Raise the question if they are real or just artifacts of mathematical formalism
- General question about relying on mathematical description as a representation of reality
- Use of 2-spinor vs. Dirac-spinor formalisms to describe Dirac equation for electron
  - Most physicists use Dirac-spinor (4-spinor) formalism
  - Zigzag picture is more directly suggested by 2-spinors than 4-spinors
  - Both valid descriptions, but not altogether usual in either formalism
- Personal stance: zigs and zags are real as idealized mathematical descriptions of fundamental ingredients of the universe
- Discussion of mathematical and physical reality will be addressed again in §34.6.

**Weyl's Neutrino Equation**
- Given by equation in §25.3
- Reasonable to consider αA and βA′ as describing massless particles, with an interaction converting each into the other.

---

### 25.3: Electroweak interactions  reflection asymmetry

**25.3 Electroweak Interactions and Reflection Asymmetry**

**Electromagnetic Interaction**:
- Each zig and zag particle has the same electric charge, conserved through interaction with electromagnetic field (photon)
- Representation of electron's trajectory: single Dirac 4-spinor line or unconventional 'zigzag' description (Fig. 25.3a,b)
- Interaction with a virtual photon (all processes are the same)

**Weak Interaction**:
- Involved in radioactive decay: uranium U238 nucleus disintegrating into thorium and helium or free neutron decaying into proton, electron, and antineutrino (Fig. 25.5)
- Mediated by W and Z bosons, called 'weak gauge bosons'
- Only the zig of a weakly interacting particle interacts with W or Z boson (Fig. 25.4)
- Previously treated as single point processes, now interpreted with intermediate gauge boson (W or Z particles) mediating the interaction process

**Reflection Asymmetry**:
- Weak interactions were once thought to be reflection-invariant
- In 1956, Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang proposed weak interactions would not be reflection-invariant
- Confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and associates in January 1957: mirror reflection of weak interaction processes was not allowed (Fig. 25.7)
- Asymmetry arises from the fact that zig looks like a zag and vice versa under mirror reflection, while each has left-handed or right-handed helicity
- Non-invariance of weak interactions under reflection symmetry realized in the fact that only the zig part of particles engages in weak decay processes (Fig. 25.8a)

---

#### Neutrino Mass, Weak Interactions, and Oscillations

**Weak Interactions and Neutrinos**

**Neutron Beta Decay**:
- Represented by a "vector boson" (W particle)
- Wu's experiment showed mirror-asymmetric electron emission patterns from radioactive cobalt 60

**Massless Neutrinos**:
- At least two of the three neutrino types have non-zero mass, around 10-7 of an electron's mass
- Massless neutrinos would have a "zigzag" pattern, with occasional flips between zig and zag

**Distinguishing Particles from Antiparticles**:
- The zig (left-handed) particles indulge in weak interactions, while the zag (right-handed) antiparticle's zig interacts
- In general, particles and antiparticles are not distinct entities but have equal status as particles in modern quantum field theory
- Even bosons (integer spin particles) have antiparticles, which may be their own antiparticles (e.g., photon, neutral pion)

---

### 25.4: Charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal

**Charge Conjugation and Parity**

**C-Conjugation (Charge Conjugation)**:
- Replaces every particle by its antiparticle
- A physical interaction invariant under this replacement is called C-invariant

**Parity (P)**:
- Refers to spatial reflection or reflection in a mirror

**Combined Operation CP**:
- The operation of combined charge conjugation and parity
- Ordinary weak interactions are not invariant under P or C separately, but they are invariant under the combined operation CP

**Time Reversal (T)**:
- Refers to reversing the direction of time in an interaction
- An interaction is invariant under T if it remains unchanged when viewed from a reversed time perspective

**CP Theorem**:
- A theorem stating that every physical interaction is invariant under CPT (charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal)
- This assumes the validity of its assumptions, which will be important later

**Antiparticle Interpretation**:
- Antiparticles can be interpreted as the spacetime reflection (PT) of a particle's antiparticle
- Equivalent to time reversal symmetry (T)

**CP Violations**:
- A few observed physical effects violate CP invariance, such as the decay of K0 mesons
- However, these effects are still invariant under CPT according to the theorem

**Feynman Diagrams**:
- Particles that are not their own antiparticles have lines directed forward or backward in time
- This allows for a consistent way of treating antiparticles within Feynman graphs

**Leptons and Quarks**:
- Leptons (electrons, muons, tauons, and their neutrinos) and quarks that compose protons and neutrons are considered particles, with zigs undergoing weak interactions
- Their antiparticles are the zags, which also participate in weak interactions
- Massive spin-1 entities like W and Z bosons mediate weak interactions, with lines attaching to zig or zag parts of leptons or quarks

**Conservation Laws**:
- Electric charge and lepton number are conserved in weak interactions
- There are three types of lepton numbers, each separately conserved in the standard model of weak interactions.

---

### 25.5: The electroweak symmetry group

**Electroweak Symmetry Group**

**The Standard Model**:
- The standard model is a fundamental theory in particle physics, unifying weak and electromagnetic interactions through electroweak theory
- This theory involves the symmetry group SU(2) × U(1) or, more correctly, U(2)
- This symmetry interrelates different leptons and quarks

**Gauge Bosons**:
- W+ and W-- are electrically charged gauge bosons that induce a change in a particle's electric charge (to ensure electric charge conservation)
- The uncharged Z0 does not change the electric charge, but it can interact with neutrino's zig part

**Massless Particles**:
- The photon appears to be singled out among all bosons as a massless particle
- The W bosons are electrically charged, whereas the photon does not carry weak charge

**Gauge Field Non-linearity**:
- The set of 3-pronged Feynman vertices involving only gauge bosons (W+, W--, Z0, or γ) is limited
- This non-linearity in the free gauge field arises from the U(2) group being non-Abelian

**Symmetry Deviations**:
- The symmetry between all gauge bosons appears to be blatantly violated due to the limited set of diagrams
- However, more symmetry is hidden in these diagrams when looked at in the appropriate way, preserving the U(2) symmetry
- Asymmetries arise because Nature chooses certain particular combinations (quantum superpositions) of elements to be realized as free particles

---

#### Electroweak theory and the role of the Higgs field in mass generation explained.

**Electroweak Theory and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking**

**Criteria for Free Particles**
- A free particle is an eigenstate of mass: determined by understanding what sets the masses of particles
- Asymmetry in particle interactions suggests spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred in early universe

**Standard Model Explanation**
- In extremely high temperatures (early universe), U(2) symmetry held exactly, making all particles equivalent
- When temperature cooled and particles "froze out", four actual particles resolved: three acquired mass and were called Ws and Z0, one remained massless, named photon
- Spontaneous symmetry breaking resulted in the Higgs field being assigned to all particles (including itself) and quarks
- Higgs field interacts with particles through a coupling constant, similar to 2–M of Dirac electron's zigzag description
- Effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking: Higgs field settles down to have a constant value everywhere, fixing overall scale for particle masses.

**Higgs Field Role and Impact on Particles**
- Incompletely described role in this book but mentioned in §26.11 and §28.1
- Regarded as responsible for assigning mass to all particles (including itself) and quarks
- Settles down to have a constant value after spontaneous symmetry breaking, determining the masses of all particles by scaling factors.

**Electroweak Theory Successes**
- Predicted existence of Z0 (and W±), confirmed with observed masses around 81.4 GeV (W+/-) and 91.2 GeV (Z0) in CERN experiments.
- Numerous other predictions have been confirmed, making electroweak theory an excellent observational fit at the time of writing.

### 25.6: Strongly interacting particles

**Strong Interactions: Modern Theory and Hadrons**

**Modern Theory of Strong Interactions:**
- Described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
- Other 'half' of standard model
- Involves the notion of 'color' that is whimsical, not related to ordinary concept

**Hadrons:**
- Bulky particles in nuclear forces
  - Neutrons and protons are examples
- Composed of quarks: hadrons = baryons + mesons
- Baryons: nucleons, hyperons
- Mesons: pions (π mesons), discovered by Powell in 1947

**Baryons vs Leptons:**
- Both fermions but leptons don't indulge in strong interactions
- Leptons have less mass than baryons except for tauon
- Many hadrons discovered: Regge recurrences, families called multiplets

**Understanding Multiplets:**
- Representations of group SU(3)/ℤ 3
- Each hadron constructed from certain basic entities called quarks and anti-quarks

**Quarks:**
- Three types (flavors): up, down, strange
- Have fractional electric charges: up, –  
  , down, –  
  , strange, –  
  
**Hypothesis about Quarks:**
- Treated as entities satisfying 'wrong statistics' for spin fermions
- Symmetry in quark spins allows understanding of multiplets

**Examples:** Decuplet and Octet Multiplets

*Decuplet Multiplet:*
  - Prediction of the Ω– particle by Gell-Mann and Ne’eman in 1962
  - Made up of three quarks, any flavor (uuu, uud, udd, ddd)
  - Symmetry in spin and complete symmetry with regard to state aspect

*Octet Multiplet:*
  - Ordinary proton (N+), neutron (N0) belong here
  - Two ways of arranging quark composition: Σ0
  and Λ0
  - Hidden symmetry due to only two independent spin states for each quark.

---

### 25.7: ‘Coloured quarks’

**Color Quarks and SU(3) Symmetry**

**Background:**
- Problem with quark spin-statistics relation solved by demanding color degree of freedom for each flavor of quark
- Antisymmetry in color ensures free particles are color neutral, passing symmetry to three-quark particles
- Colors never manifest themselves in free particles; 'unobservable'
- Three colors: red (R), yellow (Y), blue (B) or red, green, blue

**Unobservability of Colors:**
- Nine basic quarks introduced: dR, dY, dB, uR, uY, uB, sR, sY, sB; none directly observable
- Three more flavors added: charm (c), bottom (b), top (t), eighteen independent quarks in total

**Benefits of Color Degrees of Freedom:**
- Potential to use color symmetry as basis for gauge connection (QCD)
- Exact and unbroken color SU(3) symmetry provides potential for fiber bundle idea from Chapter 15
- Analogy with electromagnetism's U(1) gauge symmetry
- Gluons are the 'gauge bosons' of QCD, non-Abelian nature manifests itself in Fig. 25.14a and b (three-pronged gluon Feynman graphs)

---

#### Evolution of Flavor Symmetry and Color Charge in the Standard Model

**Standard Model: Evolution of Flavor Symmetry to Color Symmetry**

**Background:**
- In early standard models, SU(3) group played a significant role as flavor symmetry
- Three generations of quarks and leptons organized into doublets
- Concept of three generations applied to all particles
- Interrelations between strong and electroweak interactions complicated

**K0 Meson:**
- Eigenstate of strong interactions
- Decays weakly through Cabibbo angle (approximately 0.26 radians)
- KL and KS eigenstates are linear combinations of K0 and its antiparticle
- Strong and weak interaction basis states differ due to 'rotation'

**Cabibbo Angle:**
- Features in interrelations between strong and weak interactions
- Not considered 'frozen in' like the Weinberg angle (electromagnetic interactions)

**Standard Model: Symmetry Group**
- Entire standard model's symmetry group is taken to be SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)/Z6
  - Three-dimensional color index added to the flavor index from Exercise [25.5]

**SU(3) Color Index:**
- Represents an additional dimension in the standard model's symmetry group
- Introduced to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model.

---

### 25.8: Beyond the standard model?

**Beyond the Standard Model: Grand Unified Theories and Chan-Tsou Scheme**

**Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)**
- Perspective on Cabibbo angle corresponds to Weinberg angle's
- Requires a model uniting strong & weak interactions under larger symmetry group including SU(3) and U(2)
- No commonly accepted GUT, but attempts made using SU(5), SO(10), or E8

**String Theory**
- Implications of certain GUT models will be discussed in §28.2
- String theory offers insights into these matters also (see Chapter 31.14)

**Standard Model Limitations**
- Contains unexplained features and 'ragged edges' despite success
- Involves about 17 unexplained parameters
- Weinberg angle takes SU(3) as exact, U(2) broken

**Dual Symmetry Groups (Chan-Tsou Scheme)**
- Proposal by Chan Hong-Mo and Tsou Sheung Tsun (2002)
- Each non-Abelian particle symmetry group has a corresponding dual group
- Dual group plays opposite role, one exact like SU(3) or U(1), the other broken like SU(2)
- Attractive aspect: exact group involves 'confinement' of quarks

**Comparison with Conventional Attitude to Standard Model**
- In conventional perspective, it is unclear how to take SU(2) as a gauge group while being so severely broken.
- Some might view the group as reflecting hidden symmetry, but not so explicit as Chan-Tsun scheme.

**Mathematical Background (Symmetry Breaking)**
- Discussed in next chapter
- Exotic mathematical ideas behind handling symmetry breaking in standard model.

**Feynman Graphs and the Electroweak Theory**

**Vertical Temporal Ordering vs. Standard QFT Community**
- Vertical temporal ordering used in this work may be confusing to some with QFT experience
- More usual in QFT community: depict increasing time as off to the right
- Preference for vertical ordering aligns with relativity community's notation (Chapter 17)

**2-Spinor Formalism in QED and Massive Particles of Spin 1**
- Use of 2-spinor formalism could have simplified physicists’ lives

  - Zee (2003) discusses both equations

**Electroweak Symmetry Group Notation**
- Full electroweak symmetry group: SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)/Z\_{6}
- Issue with conventionally referring to it as 'U(2)' due to extension to full standard model symmetry

**Discovery of the Electroweak Theory**
- Sorting out by Stephen Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam in late 1960s (Nobel Prize winners)
- For a general reference: Zee (2003), Halzen and Martin (1984), Kaku (1993)

## 26. Quantum field theory 
###  26.1: Fundamental status of QFT in modern theory

**Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

**Fundamental Status of QFT in Modern Physics:**
- Standard model for particle physics based on QFT
- Mathematical model with remarkable accord with observational facts
- Involves ingenious mathematical ingredients that find deep harmony with Nature's ways
- Driven by powerful theoretical reasons underlying its structure
  - Consistency requirements to satisfy in a quantum theory of fields

**History and Development:**
- Initiated by Paul Dirac, Jordan, Heisenberg, and Pauli
- Early versions unable to provide finite answers, only '∞'
- Bethe, Tomonaga, Dyson, Schwinger, Feynman made the theory workable for suitable QFTs (renormalizable)
- Later developments from Ward, Weinberg, Salam, Wilson, Veltman, ’t Hooft led to the standard model of particle physics

**Challenges and Inconsistencies:**
- Circumventing infinities is a fundamental problem in QFT
- Drive for consistent answers through theoretical developments and input from observation

**Underlying Framework:**
- Based on Lagrangian schemes, subject to symmetry principles
- Modern attempts look to gravity to alter spacetime behavior and render expressions finite
- Question whether QFT itself might need modification with the principles of Einstein's general relativity

**Significance:**
- Underlies most physical theories attempting to probe the foundations of reality
- Considered 'here to stay' by many physicists, with inconsistencies attributed to specific schemes rather than the framework itself.

---

### 26.2: Creation and annihilation operators

**Creation and Annihilation Operators in Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

**Background:**
- Procedure for understanding QFT: 'second quantization'
- Wavefunction operator ψ (or Φ) creates a particle with given wavefunction
- Represents creation of new particles in state

**Creation Operator:**
- Also called a raising operator or boson creation operator
- Describes adding a particle to the vacuum state
- Associated with positive frequency wavefunctions
- Must follow Pauli principle rules for fermions (ψ² = 0) and commutation rules with other operators

**Annihilation Operator:**
- Also called a lowering or boson annihilation operator
- Removes a particle from the total state
- Associated with negative frequency wavefunctions
- Must follow commutation rules with other operators (fermions: anti-commutation)

**Interpretation:**
- Creation and annihilation operators create/remove particles from the vacuum state |0〉
- Act on specific wavefunctions ψ to form scalar products with part of the state that refers to the type of particle being removed

**Commutation Rules:**
- Fermions: creation and annihilation operators anticommute (plus sign)
  - Ψ * Φ ± ΦΨ = i k 〈ψ∣ϕ〉I
  - Reason for this rule: spin positivity, energy/particle number positivity, combinatorial properties of spinor indices
- Bosons: creation and annihilation operators commute (minus sign)
  - same as above but with minus sign instead of plus sign.

---

### 26.3: Infinite-dimensional algebras

**Infinite-dimensional algebras in Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

**Similarity to Clifford algebra:**
- Fermion anticommutation rules align with those of a Clifford algebra
- Difference: finite vs infinite dimensions

**Properties of infinite-dimensional spaces:**
- Harder to work with than finite-dimensional ones

**QFT formalism:**
- Involves infinite-dimensional versions of Hermitian scalar product, pseudo-orthogonal forms, antisymmetric forms, and complex structures

**Complex structure in QFT:**
- Not the same as earlier instances in quantum theory
- Relevant to passage from classical field to a quantum field

**Electromagnetic field:**
- Linear Maxwell equations make things easier
- Space of solutions is an infinite-dimensional real vector space, F

**Positive/negative frequency splitting:**
- Crucial for constructing appropriate QFT
- J operator transforms real vector space into a complex one, encapsulating positive and negative frequency fields

**Scalar product expression:**
- Used to normalize states when required (integral over any spacelike 3-surface)

**Non-linear or self-interacting fields:**
- Difficulties arise during quantization due to presence of interactions.

---

### 26.4: Antiparticles in QFT

**QFT Formalism and Antiparticles**

**Importance of Antiparticles in QFT:**
- Involved in understanding charged fields (complex fields)
- Differ from uncharged particles, like K0 meson vs. uncharged π0 meson
- Classical field may be real or complex, depending on particle type

**Complex Conjugation and Antiparticles:**
- Operation of complex conjugation changes charge and kind of a field
- Particle and antiparticle are different if complex conjugation yields a quantity of different character
- Uncharged particles like neutrinos can be their own antiparticles in some cases (Majorana spinor fields)

**QFT Formalism for Antiparticles:**
1. When particle is not the same as its antiparticle:
   - Use a wavefunction of negative frequency, ϕ
   - Complex conjugate of ϕ provides antiparticle wave function
2. Creation and annihilation operators:
   * for antiparticles: Φ*
   * for particles: Φ
3. Vacuum states:
   - 'Dirac sea' or fully filled negative-energy electron states: |Σ〉
   - Usual vacuum state: |0〉
4. Equivalence between descriptions:
   - Operators involve introducing the same algebraic quantity into total state, but differ in how it acts on vacuum state
5. Explanation for removing a specific state with an annihilation operator: (See [26.2] exercise)

**Algebraic Difference Between Descriptions:**
- Use anticommutation laws to move operators over and consider action on vacuum state (|0〉 or Σ〉) for a clearer understanding. (Refer to Exercise [26.2] and Fig. 12.18)

---

### 26.5: Alternative vacua

**Alternative Vacua in Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

**Problem with Alternative Vacuum States:**
- In certain cases, alternative vacuum states like |0⟩ and |Σ⟩ may not belong to the same Hilbert space
- This issue arises when no operator in A can be applied to either state to obtain the other
- Resulting in infinite or meaningless answers when computing probabilities (e.g., ⟨Σ|A|0⟩)
- Forbids constructing a consistent quantum theory with both states

**Impact on Modern Approaches:**
- 'Choice of vacuum state' is crucial in QFT, comparable to choice of algebra A generated by creation and annihilation operators
- In free electrons: |0⟩ (no particles/antiparticles) and |Σ⟩ (filled negative energy states) can be regarded as effectively equivalent despite different Hilbert spaces
- Difference between vacua seen as a matter of where we draw the line defining 'zero of charge or mass'

**Renormalization:**
- Need to renormalize charge and mass in order to get sensible physical answers from Dirac sea
- Infinite constants added to account for infinite electric charge or negative gravitational influence of Dirac sea
- These features are ubiquitous in serious approaches to particle physics, as seen in the standard model
- Renormalization and non-unique vacua have been used to address issues with observation agreement and mathematical consistency.

### 26.6: Interactions: Lagrangians and path integrals

**Interactions in Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

**Problems with Interactions in QFT:**
- Difficulties arise when attempting to treat interactions within the framework of QFT
- States can be constructed with superpositions of different numbers and unlimited particles/antiparticles
- Fock space refers to this space of such states, which can be thought of as a direct sum of Hilbert spaces
- Number of particles in a state may be unlimited, like coherent states
- Field operators do not generally commute with each other, leading to Heisenberg uncertainty relations

**Lagrangians and Path Integrals:**
- Lagrangian is a relativistically invariant entity that can be used to construct QFT
- Idea of Feynman path integrals: apply complex linear superposition to entire spacetime histories, not just quantum states
- Assign complex weighting factor (amplitude) to each history based on the Lagrangian and action integral along the path
- Total amplitude for getting from point A to B is sum of these amplitudes
- Magic role of the Lagrangian: it determines the amplitude assigned to each history.

---

#### Quantum Path Integrals: Amplitudes of Classical Histories

**Path Integral Approach to Quantum Mechanics**

**Amplitude Density**:
- In classical mechanics, amplitude has a finite value
- In path integral approach, we need an 'amplitude density' that integrates over the space of classical states
- The total probability must come out as 1

**Configuration Space**:
- Configuration space is now space itself (for a single point particle)
- Paths can be continuous spacetime paths from one spacetime point to another
- Paths do not need to be 'legal' or constrained by the rules of special relativity
- The path can even wiggle up and down in time

**Lagrangian**:
- Describes the particle's kinetic energy minus potential energy due to the field of force
- For each history, there is an action S = integral of Lagrangian along the path

**Path Integral Approach vs. Classical Mechanics**:
- In classical mechanics, we find a particular stationary-action history that represents the actual particle motion
- In path integral approach, all histories are supposed to 'coexist' in quantum superposition, and each is assigned an amplitude e^(iS/ħ)
- The idea is that far-away histories have their contributions canceled out by those of neighboring histories
- Close histories have a large contribution because their phase angles tend to align, leading to reinforcement rather than cancellation

**Applicability**:
- These ideas apply generally to the dynamics of fields and not just particles
- The classical field solutions provide the main contributions, with quantum corrections arising from near-classical histories

---

### 26.7: Divergent path integrals: Feynman’s response

**Divergent path integrals: Feynman's response**

**Mathematical justification**:
- Crude descriptions presented above are problematic from a mathematical perspective
- Infinite-dimensional space of paths requires an appropriate "measure" (infinite-dimensional volume) to handle it
- Measure is heavily weighted towards non-smooth histories, leading to divergences in the Lagrangian definition
- Divergences are serious from a mathematical point of view
- Path-integral approach may be dependent on faith that wildly divergent expressions have a deeper "Platonic" meaning

**Physical answers**:
- Calculational procedures yield uncanny physical accuracy in some cases, despite divergences
- This suggests the wildly divergent expressions may have a deeper meaning that we have not yet perceived

**Feynman propagator**:
- A step towards making sense of path integrals for free quantum particles
- Replaces the collection of histories with the **Feynman propagator**
- Propagator has unique mathematical properties, fixed by the "positive-frequency" condition

**Momentum space description**:
- More usual to describe things in momentum space
- Momentum-space propagator for a Dirac particle takes the form **i( 
  – M
  + iε)–1**
- Singularity arises when the "rest mass" (Pa²) of the particle is close to its actual rest mass, M
- Classical value for mass dominates due to large amplitude for small deviations from it.

---

### 26.8: Constructing Feynman graphs  the S-matrix

**Feynman Graphs and the S-Matrix**

**Constructing Feynman Graphs**:
- Single line (segment) of a graph is part of a complicated expression involving other particle lines and vertices
- Contributions from vertices are simple factors:
  - Scalar coupling constant governing strength of interaction
  - Terms to match indices at vertices
  - Delta-function terms ensuring momentum conservation
- Singularities arise when momenta acquire values expected for classical paths, as these are the leading contribution

**Mass Shells and Virtual Particles**:
- Real particles (observed) always on shell (momentum satisfies M^2)
- Internal lines in a Feynman graph not expected to be on shell
  - Exchanged photon cannot be on shell when there is a non-trivial interaction
- **Virtual particles** occur only in the interior of a Feynman graph and cannot "escape"

**The S-Matrix**:
- Collection of amplitudes for different in-states and out-states
- Amounts to an infinite-dimensional matrix
- Calculation of S-matrix is a major objective of QFT

**Advantages of Feynman Graphs**:
- Reduces complexity compared to sum over histories
- Allows for finite-dimensional integrals instead of divergent path integrals
- Integrals can be treated using complex contour integration methods

**Challenges with Closed Loops**:
- Divergence in integrals when there are closed loops in the Feynman graph

---

### 26.9: Renormalization

**Renormalization in Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

**Background:**
- Divergent expressions for total amplitude of quantum processes in QFT
- Ultraviolet divergences: arise from integrals that yield divergence when momentum values get indefinitely large or distances are infinitesimally small
- Renormalization process used to eliminate these infinities, collected as 'parcels'

**Ultraviolet Divergences:**
- Example of renormalization: electric charge possessed by an electron
  - Vacuum polarization effect caused by ambient electric field of the electron at E
    * Creation and annihilation of (virtual) electron-positron pairs in the electric field
    * Presence of virtual photon lines indicates creation/annihilation occurring under ambient field influence
  - Net result: reduced apparent value of electron's charge (dressed value), making it smaller than bare charge value

**Problem with Calculation:**
- Infinite numerical factor required to scale up bare charge value to match dressed value
- Two philosophical positions on the issue:
  1. Future theory may replace divergent integrals with finite values, resulting in a large but finite scaling factor instead of infinity
  2. Notion of 'bare charge' is unobservable and meaningless; only dressed charges have physical significance.

**Significance:**
- Renormalization is an essential feature of modern QFT for obtaining finite answers without the need for infinite rescaling procedures. It applies not only to charge but also to other quantities.

---

#### Quantum Field Theory and Renormalization in Particle Physics: Advantages, Limitations, and the Importance of Asymptotic Freedom

**Theories in Physics**

**Renormalizable Theories**:
- Renormalizable QFTs: Divergent parts of Feynman graphs can be collected into a finite number of "parcels" that can be "scaled away" by renormalization.
- Examples: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Standard Model

**Non-renormalizable Theories**:
- Most QFTs are non-renormalizable

**Selection Principle for Proposed Theories**:
- Renormalizability is a common standpoint among particle physicists
- Any non-renormalizable theory would be automatically rejected as inappropriate

**Challenges with Renormalization**:
- Even renormalizable theories are not free from infinities, an issue to be elaborated upon
- Pragmatic view: Relevance of infinities at accessible energies is questioned, especially for "quantized gravity" and strong interactions

**Asymptotic Freedom**:
- A property of the strong force where it effectively disappears at very large momenta/tiny distances
- Responsible for confinement of quarks in hadrons and saves the theory from being calculationally useless

---

### 26.10: Feynman graphs from Lagrangians

**Feynman Graphs and Lagrangians**

**Feynman graphs**:
- Represent perturbation expansion of quantum theory associated with a Lagrangian
- Perturbation expansion is power series in coupling constant(s)
  - For QED: electric charge `e`
  - For other theories: multiple coupling constants
- Terms of the series correspond to graphs with increasing numbers of vertices
  - Graphs with `n` vertices provide coefficient of `e^n` term

**Renormalizability**:
- Renormalization removes infinities from finite collections of Feynman graphs
- Does not guarantee that sum of all resulting finite quantities is convergent
  - For QED, sum has "logarithmic divergence" beyond terms of order 137 or so
- Need to appeal to original path integral expression for exact graph occurrence at each order
- Procedure involves treating path integral as formal quantity and applying functional derivative procedures

**Generating Feynman Graphs**:
- Unambiguous according to formal procedure
- Lagrangian is a field Lagrangian of the general type discussed in §20.5
- Path involved is an entire 4-dimensional field configuration in specified spacetime region
  - Integral of Lagrangian density over that region provides amplitude (density) for that configuration

---

### 26.11: Feynman graphs and the choice of vacuum

**Feynman Graphs and Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Field Theory**

**Manifest Symmetry in QFT**:
- The presence of symmetry under a group, like U(2) or SU(3), is usually taken to be a manifest symmetry of the Lagrangian.
- This symmetry is important for ensuring renormalizability of the quantum field theory (QFT).
- Symmetry helps ensure that divergent terms cancel each other out due to their inability to share the postulated symmetry of the theory.

**U(2) Symmetry Breaking in Electroweak Theory**:
- The resulting electroweak theory does not possess the originally postulated U(2) symmetry.
- This breaking of symmetry is taken to be the result of symmetry breaking, but it needs to be accommodated through a **U(2)-symmetric choice of vacuum state**.

**Relating Feynman Graphs and QFT Algebra**:
- **Feynman propagators**, represented by lines in Feynman graphs, are values of commutators or anticommutators found in the quantum field theory algebra.
- The Feynman propagators are normally expressed in terms of momentum space, with some subtlety in defining them.

**Calculating Amplitudes using Feynman Graphs**:
- To calculate an amplitude like 〈ψ out | ψ in〉, we can push all the annihilation operators through the creation operators until they hit the vacuum state at the right end.
- This results in a collection of Feynman propagators representing the lines of a Feynman graph, multiplied by the vacuum expectation value 〈0|0〉=1 (for a normalized vacuum).

**Using an Alternative Vacuum State**:
- We can replace the original vacuum state |0⟩ by an alternative, inequivalent vacuum state |Θ⟩.
- This allows us to preserve the renormalizability conferred by the full unbroken symmetry while only observing a smaller 'broken' symmetry group in the actual states of the system.
- This is useful for producing physical theories that can benefit from exact symmetry while not being perfectly satisfied observationally.

**Challenges and Future Directions**:
- Attempts to go beyond the standard model often try to take advantage of this symmetry breaking mechanism.
- Critical evaluation is needed, as these proposals are still very speculative.
- The next chapter will address the Big Bang concept, and Chapter 28 will examine issues with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the context of the early universe.

## 27. The Big Bang and its thermodynamic legacy 
###  27.1: Time symmetry in dynamical evolution

**The Big Bang and its thermodynamic legacy**

**Time symmetry in dynamical evolution**
- Successful physical theories since Galileo provide a dynamics: specification of how a system develops with time given initial state
- Kepler's laws (1609) were an exception, asserting shapes of planetary orbits, not dynamical law
- Modern perspective views dynamical laws as having elegant mathematical forms and simple shapes as fortunate consequences

**Dynamical determinism and reversibility**
- Dynamics evolve systems from past initial conditions to future states using differential equations (partial for fields)
- Time-symmetrical evolution mathematically possible but generally not considered in practice due to choice of initial conditions
- Special relativity: state data defined on initial spacelike surface, evolves according to dynamical equations
- General relativity: new issues raised by the effect of gravitational field on spacetime structure
- Quantum mechanics: deterministic evolution applies only to U part of theory (quantum state governed by Schrödinger equation)
- Time reversal in quantum mechanics: replace time-derivative operator iħ∂/∂t with –iħ∂/∂t, and sign of imaginary unit. However, behavior of reduction process R under time reversal is an important issue for further discussion.

---

### 27.2: Submicroscopic ingredients

**Submicroscopic ingredients and time reversal symmetry**
- Time-reversal symmetry holds for individual particles and their fields in classical mechanics.
- Detailed knowledge of individual particle positions and momenta is unobtainable and unnecessary.
- Averaged parameters, such as mass distribution, momentum, energy, etc., describe the system well enough.
- However, some systems exhibit "chaos" where final behavior depends critically on initial conditions.
  - Executive toy: magnetic pendulum over magnets
  - Weather prediction also an example of chaotic behavior
  - Newtonian gravitational motion in solar system can be considered a chaotic system, though timescales are long compared to observation
- Chaos makes future evolution predictable but past-directed "retrodiction" impossible for macroscopic systems with many particles.
- Second Law of Thermodynamics: heat flows from hotter body to colder one until equilibrium is reached.
  - Predictive power of physics relies on the Second Law.
  - Many physicists view the Second Law as an "obvious" necessity, rather than fundamental law like conservation laws or standard model.

---

### 27.3: Entropy

**Second Law of Thermodynamics**

**First Law of Thermodynamics**:
- Total energy is conserved in an isolated system
- Heat is a form of energy, previously not clear
- Energy is measured as kinetic energy and vibrations of particles

**Second Law of Thermodynamics**:
- Entropy, a measure of 'randomness', has a larger value after a process than before
- Entropy was introduced by Clausius in 1865 and clarified by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1877
- Entropy is defined as the natural logarithm of the volume (in phase space) of a region representing macroscopically indistinguishable states
- **Coarse graining**: dividing phase space into subregions, each representing physical states that are macroscopically indistinguishable
- Entropy is relatively arbitrary, depending on how closely one examines the system and where boundaries are drawn between regions.

**Entropy as a Convenience**:
- In practice, the arbitrariness of entropy's definition has little effect on thermodynamic calculations
- This is because in most cases, one considers enormous ratios between the sizes of box volumes, so boundary changes make little difference to entropy values.
- Entropy is seen as a "convenience" rather than a fundamental concept in current physics theory.
- However, quantum physics and considerations of black hole entropy may suggest a more fundamental status for this notion in the future.

---

### 27.4: The robustness of the entropy concept

**Boltzmann's Entropy Formula Illustration**

**Background:**
- Closed container with a region R, a small part of the total volume
- Contains gas consisting of m molecules (~10^22)
- Boltzmann's formula: S = k log V_R
- Assumes Boltzmann statistics for simplicity

**Calculations:**
1. Ratio of phase space region V_R to total phase space P: 10^-m (~10^-10^23)
2. Entropy difference between specialized and random distribution: ~2.3 * 10^22 k (≈1/3 joule per Kelvin)
3. Permitting gas flow into non-special region increases entropy by significant amount
4. Definition of V_R relaxed to contain at least 99.9% of gas molecules, virtually no impact on result
5. Additivity of entropy for independent systems: S_total = S_1 + S_2 (assuming P = P_1 × P_2 and coarse-graining boxes are products)
6. Normal physical systems have a dominant box, representing thermal equilibrium (Maxwell distribution), with vastly larger volume than others
7. Entropy increase towards thermal equilibrium in accordance with the second law
8. The logarithm in Boltzmann's formula manages large numbers and ensures additivity for independent systems.

#### Statistical Mechanics: Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution and Entropy in Classical Systems

**Maxwell Distribution and Equipartition of Energy**

**Maxwell Distribution for Identical Classical Bodies:**
- Applies to gases with no internal degrees of freedom
- Describes velocity distribution in thermal equilibrium
- Has the form `Ae–βυ²` where:
  - `A` and `β` are constants
  - `β` relates to temperature, `T` (`β = 1/(kT)`)
  - `υ` is particle speed

**Generalization for Systems with Internal Degrees of Freedom:**
- Equipartition theorem states energy is distributed equally among all degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium

**Approach to Thermal Equilibrium:**
- Boltzmann equation used to describe evolution towards equilibrium

**Statistical Mechanics**:
- Subject that studies behavior of large numbers of constituent particles

**Question Answers:**

**[27.2] Maxwell Distribution and Equipartition Theorem:**
- Maxwell distribution: Ae–βυ² (for identical classical bodies)
- Equipartition theorem: energy distributed equally among all degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium

**[27.3] Absolute Measure for Phase Space Volume:**
- Units are chosen such that `ħ = 1`, no solution provided

**[27.4] Logarithm and Stupendous Discrepancies:**
- Not covered in given text

**[27.5] Counting Differences:**
- Three cases not specified

**[27.6] Fermion/Boson Considerations and Momentum Decrease:**
- Result not significantly affected

**[27.7] Entropy Increase Calculation:**
- Approximately 2.29 × 10²² k instead of 2.30 × 10²² k due to various rough estimates

**[27.8] Course Graining Assumption:**
- Natural assumption as it simplifies complex systems by lumping individual particles into a single macroscopic entity.

---

### 27.5: Derivation of the second law—or not?

**Understanding the Second Law of Thermodynamics**

**The Argument for the Second Law**:
- Imagine a physical system represented by a point x in some phase space P
- Suppose x starts NOW in a small coarse-graining box V with volume V
- The point x will move around in P, and is expected to wander into larger and larger boxes as time marches forward
- This results in the entropy of the system getting larger and larger
- Once x finds its way into a certain entropy measure box, it becomes unlikely that it can return to a significantly smaller box
- The odds are against finding an absurdly small volume for x to move to within a sensible time period
- The same argument applies when considering the past evolution of the system

**The Issue with Time Symmetry**:
- The argument seems to lead to a time-asymmetrical law, while the underlying physics may be symmetrical in time
- If we apply the same argument backward in time, it implies that entropy was increasing in the past, which is at odds with observations of the universe

**Resolving the Issue**:
- When starting with the gas entirely in a region R, the correct future behavior is for the gas to flood out of R and increase the entropy
- However, the most likely way for the gas to have found itself in R just before t0 was for it to be spread throughout the container in thermal equilibrium and then spontaneously concentrate in R

---

#### Resolving the Time-Reversal Paradox in Gas Entropy Dynamics

**The Second Law of Thermodynamics: An Explanation and Its Limitations**

**Understanding Entropy and Gas Behavior**
- The Second Law states that entropy, or disorder, increases with time in any closed system.
- In practice, a gas cannot spontaneously appear entirely within a certain region R without violating the Second Law.
- However, it is possible for all or most of the gas to end up within R if an experimenter manually moves the gas into that region and removes excess gas from outside R.
- The entropy continues to increase during this process through various means, such as heat transfer and changes in the system's components.

**Implications for Time Reversal of the Second Law**
- The reasoning seems to suggest a time reversal of the Second Law for behavior into the past when deriving this result.
- However, this deduction is not physically significant since it only applies to an artificial scenario created by manipulating the system and its boundaries.
- In reality, the experimenter's body and external factors like the Sun still follow the actual second law of thermodynamics.

**Limitations of the Phase Space Argument**
- The phase space argument is incomplete when considering an enlarged system that includes the experimenter and more elements from the universe.
- Applying this argument may lead to the seemingly absurd result of entropy increasing into the past, but this does not contradict actual experience or the validity of the Second Law.

---

### 27.6: Is the whole universe an ‘isolated system’?

**Theoreticians' Distinction Between Isolated and Open Systems:**
- Some theoreticians argue for a distinction between 'isolated' and 'open' systems based on entropy behavior
- In an isolated system, entropy increases until equilibrium is reached
- In open systems, outside influences can reduce entropy from time to time (such as intervention by an experimenter or low-entropy inputs)
- This argument has provisional status because these outside influences can be incorporated into the entire system, making it 'open' in practice

**Entropy Increase and Universe:**
- Entropy increase discussion can be applied to the whole universe (U)
- Phase-space Pu describes possible universes and their evolutions
- Standard cosmological models possess a naturally defined time coordinate for approximating temporal evolution
- The entire universe's entropy increase is related to its spatial geometry, distribution of continuous fields, and gravitational field encoded in location within Pu

**Misconceptions about Entropy Increase:**
- A common view is that the entropy increase is a consequence of universe expansion
- This misunderstands that all states accessible to the universe must be represented in Pu, which does not 'grow with time'
- No such 'ceiling' on entropy values exists; all dynamically accessible states must be represented in Pu.

---

### 27.7: The role of the Big Bang

**Role of Big Bang in Universe's Evolution**
* The parametrized curve ξ represents a possible universe history in phase-space Pu
* If randomly placed into Pu, ξ would likely lie entirely in the most enormous thermal-equilibrium box E, with no measureable entropy increase
* This is at odds with our actual universe, where Second Law holds sway
* Alternatively, if x (representing the observable universe) lies in a reasonable-sized region V but ξ is chosen randomly, leads to violation of the Second Law in past
* Actual universe evolution resembles Fig. 27.8b,d: an exceedingly tiny initial region B at the past end of ξ (Big Bang), followed by entering larger and larger volumes as time progresses
* The puzzle lies in how ξ ends up in B despite being surrounded by increasingly smaller boxes as time goes back to the past.

**Understanding Big Bang's Specialness**
* The region B represents the Big Bang origin of the universe
* Theories suggest it was an explosive event, based on Friedmann's theoretical study in 1922 and Hubble's observational evidence in 1929
* Observational reasons for believing in the Big Bang:
	+ Hubble's discovery that distant galaxies recede from us at a velocity proportional to distance
	+ Presence of universal radiation with temperature around 2.7 K, believed to be the attenuated 'flash' of the Big Bang.

#### Understanding the Sun's Role in Lowering Entropy for Life on Earth through Gravitational Condensation

**Physical Insights into the Nature of Low Entropy in the Early Universe**

**The Uniformity of the Early Universe**:
- The early universe was extremely uniform (to 1 part in 105) after the Big Bang
- This indicates that the early universe was well described by cosmological models

**Understanding Low Entropy in the Early Universe**:
- The extraordinary specialness of the Big Bang corresponded to a very low entropy
- This low entropy is relevant to us on Earth through the familiar Second Law
- **Physical Insights**:
  - **Sun's Role as a Low-Entropy Source**:
    - The energy from the Sun, which we rely on, must be provided in a low-entropy form
    - A uniformly illuminated sky with thermal equilibrium would not allow us to use the energy
  - Plants take advantage of the Sun's low-entropy energy through photosynthesis
  - We then consume the plants or eat something that eats them, and breathe the oxygen they release
  - The "lowness" in the Sun's entropy comes from the gravitational condensation of a previously uniform gas
  - Gravitation is confusing in relation to entropy, as it tends to have more entropy in clumped objects

**The Maximum Entropy State**:
- With a gas, thermal equilibrium has the gas spread uniformly throughout the region
- For large gravitating bodies, maximum entropy is achieved when all the mass is concentrated in one place (a black hole)

---

### 27.8: Black holes

**Black Holes**

**What is a Black Hole?**
- Roughly speaking: region of spacetime where material has undergone gravitational collapse, escape velocity exceeds light speed
- Formed when large, concentrated body's escape velocity surpasses the speed of light

**Newtonian Theory vs. Relativity Theory**
- Michell and Laplace's observations in Newtonian theory do not provide a clear answer on black holes
  *Speed of light has no absolute status in Newtonian theory*
  *Arguments can be made that light could still escape even with large escape velocities*
- In relativity theory, the speed of light is fundamental and represents the limiting speed for all signaling
  *General relativistic spacetime required instead of just Minkowski space*

**Black Hole Formation**
- Occurs when a large, massive body collapses under its own gravitational influence after exhausting internal energy sources
- Gravitational collapse becomes unstoppable when internal pressure forces are insufficient to hold the body apart
  *White dwarfs and neutron stars held together by degeneracy pressure*
- Chandrasekhar limit established for white dwarfs: maximum mass of about 1.4M    

**Black Hole Formation Process**
- Star cools, core collapses when it exceeds Chandrasekhar limit
- Collapse may trigger violent explosion (supernova) if sufficient material is shed
- If not enough material is lost, the star continues to collapse until it reaches the scale of Michell's considerations
  *Formation of an event horizon, no further information from star can reach outside observer*

---

#### Black Holes: Observational Evidence and Properties

**Black Holes: Schwarzschild Solution**

**Origin of Schwarzschild Solution:**
- Discovered by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, shortly after Einstein's theory publication
- Describes static gravitational field surrounding a spherically symmetrical body

**Horizon Distance:**
- Occurs at radial distance r = 2MG/c² (Michell's critical value)

**Black Hole Formation:**
- Matter collapses inwards through the event horizon, no escape afterwards
- External observer cannot see inside after formation
- No material substance but a hypersurface separating escapable signals from trapped ones

**Evidence for Black Holes:**
- Indirect evidence: double-star systems with compact objects too massive for white dwarfs or neutron stars (Cygnus X-1)
- Direct evidence: no observable surface of some falling material, confirming black hole presence

**Other Types of Black Holes:**
- Stellar black holes: few times the mass of Sun
- Supermassive black holes: millions to billions of Suns' mass (Milky Way's center)

**Schwarzschild Metric Form:**
ds² = (1 – 2M/r)dt² – (1 – 2M/r)–1 dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²), where units are chosen so that G = c = 1.

**Radial Coordinate:**
Fixed by requiring area of spheres of constants r and t to be finite.

**Singularity:**
The center of black hole, not extended in space or time, infinite density and pressure.

**Eddington-Finkelstein Form:**
Useful for extending metric smoothly to the r < 2M region.

---

### 27.9: Event horizons and spacetime singularities

**Event horizons and spacetime singularities**

**Features of a black hole:**
- Event horizon: 3-surface that no signals can escape from the region inside it (Oppenheimer & Snyder, 1939)
  * Tilted null cones make crossing impossible without violating causality
  * Strange properties but local geometry is not significantly different than elsewhere
  - Observer would notice nothing passing through from outside to inside
- Singularity at the center (r = 0): Infinite tidal forces and spacetime curvature
  * Destructive for any physical material approaching it
  * Unavoidable in gravitational collapse with certain assumptions (Einstein's equation, non-negative energy densities)

**General features:**

### 27.10: Black-hole entropy

**Black-hole entropy**

**Black holes**:
- Stationary (‘dead’) black holes have large entropies
- Despite their simple geometrical form, they represent an enormous number of microscopically distinct states

**Kerr metric**:
- Describes the geometry of a black hole's external region
- Characterized by two physical/geometrical parameters: m (mass) and a (angular momentum)

**Relentless nature of a black hole**:
- Sweeps up all kinds of material, converting it into a single configuration with 10 parameters
- Manifestation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics

**Bekenstein–Hawking formula for black-hole entropy**:
- Proportional to the area of the hole's horizon (A)
- Entropy (SBH) = A in Planck units

**Comparison with microwave radiation entropy**:
- Black holes have much larger entropies than the microwave background from the Big Bang
- The entropy of a black hole grows relentlessly over time

---

### 27.11: Cosmology

**Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Models**

**Description:**
- Based on Einstein's equations
- Characterized by spatial homogeneity and isotropy
- Identical universe appearance in all directions
- O(3) rotational symmetry group
- Three types of 3-geometry: positive, zero, negative curvature (K > 0, K = 0, K < 0)

**Assumptions:**
- Completely uniform distribution of galaxies on a large scale
- Homogeneous and isotropy approximations to the universe's structure
- Good agreement with observations for distant regions and microwave background radiation
- Spatial isotropy and homogeneity imply that 3-dimensional 'constant-time' spatial sections fill up space-time without intersecting each other.

**Geometries:**
- Positive curvature (K > 0): Universe fills up with 3-spheres, ultimately collapses in Big Crunch
- Zero curvature (K = 0): Euclidean 3-spaces
- Negative curvature (K < 0): Hyperbolic 3-spaces

**Singularity and Expansion:**
- Starts from a singularity or Big Bang
- Expands rapidly outwards
- Ultimate behavior depends on value of K.

---

#### Cosmological Expansion: Closed, Open, and Flat Universe Models

**Friedmann Models and Cosmology**

**Expansion of the Universe**:
- The expansion eventually reverses, leading to a 'Big Crunch' singularity if K > 0 (Fig. 27.13a)
- If K = 0 (Fig. 27.13b), the expansion just manages to continue without collapse
- If K < 0 (Fig. 27.13c), there is no prospect of collapse, as the expansion approaches a constant rate
- Analogy with stone thrown upwards:
  - Less than escape velocity: falls back to ground (K > 0)
  - Equal to escape velocity: just fails to fall back (K = 0)
  - Greater than escape velocity: continues and approaches limiting rate (K < 0)

**Cosmological Constant (Λ)**:
- Original Friedmann work did not include the cosmological constant Λ
- Recent observational evidence suggests a positive cosmological constant (Λ > 0) in our universe's behavior
- Cosmologists now allow for Einstein's 1917 suggestion of a cosmological term Λgab

**Universal Expansion Models**:
- The 'dust' model is not appropriate for the radiation-dominated phase before decoupling (~ 3 x 10^(5) years old)
- Tolman's radiation-filled model may be more appropriate for this phase
- Proponents of inflationary cosmology suggest an exponential expansion, but it does not affect the appearance of Fig. 27.13 or 27.14

**Spatial Geometries**:
- **K > 0**: 3-sphere (also projective space ℝℙ^3)
- **K = 0**: Ordinary Euclidean 3-space
- **K < 0**: Hyperbolic 3-geometry

**Closed vs. Open Universes**:
- K > 0 is a 'closed' universe, containing a compact spacelike hypersurface
- The term 'open' is more correctly applied to the K = 0 case (ordinary Euclidean space)
- Abandoning global isotropy leads to non-isotropic closed-universe models for K = 0 and K < 0

**Universe Expansion Analogy**:
- The universe expands, with no 'central point' from which everything recedes
- The analogy of a balloon being blown up is more appropriate than a central explosion

#### Evolution of Cosmic Expansion in Friedmann Models

**Friedmann Models and Spacetime Metrics**

**R(t) Graphs for Friedmann Models:**
- **K > 0:** Figure 27.15a: Curve for 'dust' (pressureless fluid) with Λ = 0
- **K = 0:** Not plotted, but similar to Figure 27.15b
- **K < 0:** Not plotted, but similar to Figure 27.15c
- **Λ > 0:** Figure 27.15d: Curve for all three values of K (provided Λ is large enough)

**Spacetime Metrics:**
- ds² = dt² – R²(t) dΣ²
- R(t): Size of the spatial universe at time t
- dΣ²: Metric form of one of the three 3-geometries (unit sphere or hyperbolic space)
- Normalize metric to be that of unit 3-sphere or unit hyperbolic space when K ≠ 0

**Ultimate Expansion Rate:**
- Exponential rate in case of a positive Λ
- Observations suggest this is the case

**Connected (3-)Space and Homogeneity:**
- A connected (3-)space cannot be isotropic about two distinct points without being homogeneous. [Explanation required]

**Deriving Factor in Friedmannian Model Behavior:**
- Small values of time: t = AR³/2 for 'dust' model
- Large values of time: t = BR² for Tolman's radiation model
- Tangents to the curves must match

**Metric Forms of Unit 3-Sphere and Hyperbolic Space:**
- dΣ² = dr² + sin²φ(dφ² + sin²θdθ²) describes metric of a unit 3-sphere
- dΣ² = dr² + sinh²χ(dχ² + sin²θdθ²) describes unit hyperbolic space. [Explanation required]

### 27.12: Conformal diagrams

**Conformal Diagrams**

**Observable Universe**
- Representation of entire spacetime in a finite region of Euclidean plane (2D or 3D) using conformal diagrams
- Lorentzian metric of spacetime is being conformally represented
- Key feature: null cones define the conformal geometry

**Two Dimensions**
- Null cone consists of pair of null directions determining 2-metric up to local conformal factor
- Useful for spherically symmetric spacetimes with S2 representation in 4D space

**Three Dimensions (n=2) or More**
- Points represent entire n-(n-2)-spheres, like S3 or Sn-1
- Exceptional places: singularities or symmetry axes indicated by dashed or filled lines
- Corners: represent entire spheres (○) or points (•)

**Conformal Diagrams Usefulness**
- Make causality properties of spacetimes manifest
- Singularities and horizons can be depicted as spacelike boundaries

**Black Hole Collapse**
- Region behind horizon cannot be escaped by material particles once crossed into it
- Once inside, forced into singularity
- Counterintuitive: singularity acts as future boundary to the interior part of the spacetime

**Big Bang**
- Spacelike nature leads to particle horizon concept
- Particles outside observer's observable universe cannot be accessed for observation.

---

#### Conformal Diagrams and Cosmic Expansion

**Minkowski Space Conformal Diagrams and Horizons**

**Strict conformal diagrams for Minkowski space**:
- Strict conformal diagrams for Fig. 27.11, depicting spherically symmetric collapse to a black hole: (c) in Fig. 27.18

**Friedmann Models Conformal Diagrams**:
- Fig. 27.18 shows strict conformal diagrams for the respective Friedmann models of Fig. 27.13:
  - K > 0, Λ = 0 (a)
  - K = 0, Λ = 0 (b)
  - K < 0, Λ = 0 (c)
  - K > 0, Λ > 0 (d)
  - K = 0, Λ > 0 (e)
  - K < 0, Λ > 0 (f)

**Event Horizons**:
- Event horizons occur when a future boundary—either a singularity or infinity—is spacelike in a schematic conformal diagram
- An observer p approaches the boundary cannot see some portion of the spacetime, depending on their movement (left vs right)
- For black hole, the event horizon is more familiar as the dotted line in the figure, common to all external observers

**Particle Horizons**:
- Particle horizons occur in all standard cosmologies, arising from the past singularity being spacelike
- Observer p sees only a limited portion P of the Big Bang (and particles produced there), which grows with time

**Minkowski 4-Space Exercise**:
- Can be obtained by taking the right-hand half of the entire Minkowski 2-space and rotating about the vertical axis
- Express the 4-space metric using suitable functions of t, r, θ, and ϕ

**Conformal Factors**:
- Find appropriate conformal factors multiplying the metrics for each example in Figs. 27.16,27.17

**Observable Universe Expansion**:
- For K = 0 or K < 0, where Λ = 0, the observable universe of a particle originating at p increases to include the entire universe, in its future limit of time
- This is not true for the case K > 0, or for any K if Λ > 0 (cosmological event horizon occurs)

---

### 27.13: Our extraordinarily special Big Bang

**The Big Bang's Unique "Specialness"**

**Evidence for a Low-Entropy Universe:**
- Second Law of Thermodynamics requires initial low entropy
- Microwave background radiation matches Planck's blackbody curve
- Nuclear processes in early universe agree with theoretical calculations, assuming thermal equilibrium

**Misconceptions about the Big Bang's Entropy:**
- Some cosmologists believe small size led to lower entropy due to fewer degrees of freedom
- Incorrect resolution: gravitational degrees of freedom are often overlooked

**Gravitational Degrees of Freedom and Entropy:**
- Clumping of material can represent higher entropy than thermal motions
- Black holes provide a huge reservoir of entropy

**Entropy in a Closed Universe with Black Holes:**
- Galaxies containing substantial black holes lead to large total entropy (10^101)
- Entropy increases during final collapse phase, leading to "messy" Big Crunch
- Final state: congealing black hole singularities instead of tidy collapse

**Implications for Observations:**
- Even with positive Λ, the same measure of entropy (~10^123) can be found in a closed universe
- Reversibility of dynamical equations applies to both expanding and collapsing universes.

---

#### The Fine-Tuning Problem in Cosmology: Extraordinary Initial Conditions and the Unique Role of Gravity.

**Comparison of Big Bang Theory and Entropy**

**Implications of Irregularities:**
- For K > 0, Λ = 0 leads to a 'dreadful mess' of congealing black-hole singularities with high entropy (S ≈ 10^(123))
- This is not dependent on Λ = 0, as perturbations in time-reverse of Fig. 27.13d (K > 0, Λ > 0) also result in similar mess
- A generic Big Bang looks like the time-reverse of such a collapse for K > 0 and either Λ = 0 or Λ > 0
- Most 'probable' situation (Fig. 27.8a) bears no resemblance to actual universe, especially in early stages

**Estimating Universe's Total Volume:**
- Entropy today estimated using black hole estimate and entropy per baryon value (10^8)
- Comparison with observable universe's volume N and Big Bang's entropy volume B
  - Each of B and N is only one part in 10^(-308) of total volume E
- Creator's challenge: finding a tiny spot in phase-space Pu to create a special Big Bang like ours

**Possible Solutions:**
- Universe may be spatially infinite, affecting only observable universe's arguments
- Requirement for infinite precision on Creator's part if applying arguments to the entire universe

**Significance of Findings:**
- Big Bang origin was extraordinarily special regarding matter and energy thermalization
- Gravity has a unique status, not sharing in thermalization of other fields
- Theories attempting to explain this puzzle are discussed in Chapter 28.

## 28. Speculative theories of the early universe 
###  28.1: Early-universe spontaneous symmetry breaking

**Early Universe Speculative Theories**
- Discussing ideas beyond established physical theory in the context of inflationary cosmology and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB)
- Inflationary cosmology: exponential expansion in early universe, often seen as an established fact but lacks significant observational support
- Spontaneous symmetry breaking: idea that system chooses a 'vacuum state' with less symmetry than full dynamical theory
  - Applies to renormalizable quantum field theories (QFTs) and electroweak part of standard model
  - Essential for inflationary cosmology and unified schemes
- Concern about overuse and misapplication of SSB in physics research

**Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking**
- Powerful idea producing renormalizable QFTs through hidden symmetry
- Example: electroweak part of standard model, superconductivity
- Distinctive appeal may lead to broad or inappropriate application

**Introduction to Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking**
- Magnetism in iron ball: random arrangement of atomic magnets at high temperatures vs. aligned and magnetized state below Curie point (770 °C/1043 K)
- Minimum energy occurs when all atoms are aligned, leading to random final magnetization direction
- Symmetry breaking: initial spherically symmetrical state evolves to smaller symmetry (SO(2) from SO(3))

**Figure 28.1: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking with a 'Mexican Hat' Potential**
- Marble represents system state, constrained to the surface of the hat
- Equilibrium state at high temperature (unmagnetized iron ball) has full rotational symmetry (SO(2))
- Cooling causes marble to roll down and reach arbitrary equilibrium point in rim, breaking full rotational symmetry.

---

#### Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Field Theory

**The "hat" represents:**
- The family of allowable states of the system
- Where "height" represents the system's energy

**Equilibrium state (peak of the hat):**
- Represents complete symmetry of the original group, analogous to full SO(3) symmetry of the iron ball
- But this equilibrium is unstable and does not represent minimum available energies
- Minima are represented by horizontal parts just inside the rim of the hat, each point representing a different direction of magnetization for the iron ball

**Marble's choice:**
- Initially at the peak (unmagnetized state)
- But will roll away from that point and come to rest in one of the minima, breaking symmetry in a randomly chosen direction
- This is called a phase transition when the temperature is lowered, inducing an abrupt change in nature of stable equilibrium states

**More familiar examples:**
- Freezing: state passes from liquid to solid
- Boiling: state passes from liquid to gas

**In QFT processes:**
- Phase transition involves a new choice of vacuum state (approximation)
- Symmetry reduction is not essential in QFT processes, but often occurs

**Higher dimensional versions:**
- Spontaneous breaking of symmetry down from SO(p) to SO(p – 1), where p > 2

**Mexican hat illustration:**
- Breaking from U(2) down to U(1) in standard model of particle physics
- Electroweak U(2) symmetry broken down to electromagnetism's U(1) symmetry at temperature of about 1016 K, occurring a fleeting 10–12 s after Big Bang
- In more general GUT theories, other groups like SU(5) involved and different stages of symmetry breaking occur at different temperatures.

---

### 28.2: Cosmic topological defects

**Cosmic Topological Defects**

**Symmetry Breaking**:
- Symmetry breaking is unlikely to occur "all at once"
- Domains where symmetry is broken in different directions may exist
- Example: Idealized iron ball with random initial magnetization direction choices
- With slow cooling, non-uniformities might even out
- Alternatively, rapid cooling could result in a "patchwork" of magnetization directions

**Topological Defects**:
- Dirac magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south magnetic pole) cannot be produced in ordinary space with collections of magnets and currents
- Effective monopole can be achieved by allowing magnetic charge to be "piped away" along a "Dirac wire"
- Monopoles also exist in suitable non-Abelian gauge theories
- Topological defects may occur on a grand scale in the early universe, with three basic types:
  - Cosmic monopoles (0-dimensional)
  - Cosmic strings (1-dimensional)
  - Domain walls (2-dimensional)
- These defects cannot be removed by continuous variation of the "direction" of symmetry breaking

**Implications for Electroweak Theory**:
- Electroweak theory is well-supported observationally
- Cosmic monopoles could arise from the spontaneous breaking from U(2) down to U(1), but only if gauge monopoles were present in the unbroken U(2)-symmetric phase
- Gauge monopoles are analogous to Dirac's proposed magnetic monopoles in Abelian gauge theory
- If significant Yang–Mills monopoles existed, they would cause observational conflicts

---

### 28.3: Problems for early-universe symmetry breaking

**Problems with early-universe symmetry breaking in electroweak theory**

**Background:**
- Electroweak theorists believe symmetry breaking occurred at about 10–12 seconds after Big Bang
- Questioning this reality is an unconventional position
- U(2) symmetry held before, with leptons and quarks massless
- Temperature drop led to a random choice of gauge bosons (W–, W+, Z°, γ) at each point

**Issues with Symmetry Breaking:**
1. **Identification problem:**
   - Space G of possible gauge bosons is symmetric before reduction
   - No a priori rule for identifying same element between points
   - Standpoint that 'the same' is defined by spontaneous symmetry breaking contradicts gauge theory
2. **Local parallelism:**
   - Identification not globally consistent due to randomness in symmetry breaking
3. **Particle horizons and communication:**
   - Observer at point p sees quasars q and r out of communication, preventing consistency between their symmetry breakings
4. **Inflationary scenario:**
   - Bringing q and r into 'communication' after all does not help with this issue as they still play the role of Big Bang in causality considerations for electroweak symmetry breaking.

---

#### Inflation's Cosmological Scenario: Resolving the Horizon Problem and Symmetry in Physics

**Inflation's 'resolution' of horizon problem**
- Pushed Big Bang back, so pasts of q and r intersect before reaching Big Bang surface
- Resolved former problem, but not latter (intersections occur prior to 'freezing out')
- Photon is only massless gauge boson, can travel from q to p or r to p along null lines
- Notion of photon at q may be inconsistent with notion at r due to random selection without causal influence

**Photon 'ironing out' problem**
- Difficulty for all along null lines maintaining consistent notion of photon
- Could lead to conflict with observation, as distant objects seen clearly through optical telescopes

**Abandoning electroweak theory**
- Not suggesting abandonment based on confusion over phenomena from cosmological distances
- Prefer different attitude towards breaking symmetry in electroweak theory
- Present day QFTs have issues providing finite answers, nature's true scheme not yet revealed

**Renormalizability and symmetry**
- Want a renormalizable theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions
- Symmetry notion prevalent for probing Nature's secrets, but may not always be fundamental
- Large symmetry groups are complicated rather than simple in fundamental physical theories
- Possibility of fundamental asymmetries inherent in nature's laws, approximations that do not persist at deepest levels.

---

### 28.4: Inflationary cosmology

**Inflationary Cosmology**

**Monopoles and GUTs**:
- Monopoles are a problem in certain Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)
- Lack of evidence for monopole existence
- Observational limits on monopole abundance are much lower than predicted by GUTs

**Inflationary Period Proposal**:
- In 1981, Alan Guth proposed an "inflationary period" of extreme exponential expansion
- This could make unwanted monopoles sparse enough to evade detection

**Uniformity of the Universe**:
- The universe is extremely uniform on a large scale
- This presents a "horizon problem", as distant regions were not in causal communication
- Inflationary period could resolve this by bringing regions into thermal equilibrium

**Smoothness Problem**:
- Inflationary period could also explain the remarkable uniformity of matter distribution and spacetime geometry
- Initial state would be "ironed out" during the inflationary expansion

**Inflationary Cosmology Model**:
- Based on the "steady-state version of de Sitter space"
- Described mathematically as a Lorentzian 4-sphere in Minkowski 5-space or a hyperboloid in spacetime
- Unlike anti-de Sitter space, de Sitter space is not causality violating

---

#### Inflationary Universe Model Construction: Pasting Steady State onto FLRW Spaces

**De Sitter Spacetime**
- Lorentzian '4-sphere' in Minkowski 5-space (Fig. 28.7) with intrinsic metric signature + – – –
- Steady-state model obtained by cutting hyperboloid along t = w plane, retaining upper half
- Metric can be expressed as ds² = dτ² - eAτ, where A is a constant (FLRW metrics with flat K = 0 space sections and exponential expansion)
- Ricci tensor Rab proportional to metric gab for de Sitter space
- Originally used to model the universe, fell out of favor due to conflict with observations

**Anti-de Sitter Spacetime**
- Lorentzian '4-sphere' in pseudo-Minkowskian 5-space (Fig. 28.8) with intrinsic metric signature + – – –
- Closed timelike curves can be removed by infinitely unwrapping in the (t, w)-plane
- Metric is ds² = dt² + dw² - dx² - dy² - dz²

**Steady-state Universe**
- Upper half of de Sitter space with an incompleteness not considered as a defect
- Ricci tensor Rab proportional to metric gab for anti-de Sitter space
- Inflationary universe model constructed by pasting inflationary portion from steady-state into a standard K = 0 FLRW model (Fig. 28.10)
- Necessity of introducing new scalar field φ, sometimes referred to as a 'Higgs' field, to obtain an inflationary phase in the early universe.

---

#### Exploration of Inflationary Universe Model and de Sitter Spaces in Cosmology.

**Inflationary Model and de Sitter Space**

**Effective Energy Density in Very Early Universe:**
- Dominated by effective potential V(ϕ) for scalar 'inflaton' field ϕ
- Inflation occurs during state's 'roll down hill' on left of graph (Fig. 28.11)
- False vacuum has an extremely high density compared to present epoch
  - Corresponds to a density exceeding that of water by about 10^(80)
  - Completely dominates energy-momentum tensor of any ordinary matter

**Inflationary Phase:**
- Ceases when bottom is reached (Fig. 28.11)
- Evidence for positive Λ in present epoch, but extremely small compared to inflationary phase

**History of Very Early Universe:**
- Speculative up to about 1 second after Big Bang
- 'Standard' picture frequently presented as established fact

**Exercises:**

[28.4] De Sitter and Anti-de Sitter Spaces:
- Find equations for these spaces in background 5-space using coordinates t, w, x, y, z (Figs. 28.7 and 28.8)
- Determine coordinates within 'half' of de Sitter space that give its intrinsic metric a 'steady-state' form

[28.5] Metric Forms for FLRW Type De Sitter and Anti-de Sitter Spaces:
- Find metric forms for these spaces using R(t) and hyperbolic 3-metric dΣ² from Exercise [27.18]
- Determine which portion of the full (anti-)de Sitter space they cover

[28.6] Reasoning Behind Results:
- Can you explain why these results must be so without doing any calculation?

---

### 28.5: Are the motivations for inflation valid?

**Inflationary Cosmology: A Critique**

**Background:**
- Popular idea in modern cosmological thinking, but author casts doubt on its basis
- Previous scientific ideas based on questionable motivations have been revised
- Important caution advised due to emotional responses and religious preferences related to the origin of the universe

**Issues with Inflationary Cosmology:**
1. **Motivations for inflation**: strong reasons to doubt initial motivations, but predictions may still stand on their own if confirmed
2. **Horizon problem**: fundamental issue not addressed by inflationists; Second Law's precision puzzle not considered
3. **Smoothness and flatness problems**: handled by fine-tuning in standard model, regarded as 'ugly' by inflationists
4. **Aesthetic arguments**: questionable elements like the introduction of scalar fields and preference for specific properties
5. **Role of beauty as a guide**: debate among mathematicians on what constitutes beauty; contentious issue in theoretical physics (to be discussed later)
6. **Fashionability**: popular among cosmologists, but importance questioned by author
7. **Misconceptions about thermalization process**: increasing entropy contradicts explanation of specialness of early universe
8. **Deep puzzles of the early universe**: cannot be explained simply by appealing to Second Law manifestations (like thermalization)
9. **Role in Second Law**: crucial aspect of existence, deep puzzle that cannot be easily explained by current understanding.

---

#### The Passage discusses the flawed notion of a 'generic' initial state for the universe and explains why it cannot account for the uniformity observed today.

**Possibilities for Uniformity of Universe**

**Case (a)**
- Temperatures unequal at time t0, became equal between t0 and t1
- Entropy increase between t0 and t1
- Even greater degree of specialness at t0 than at t1
- Problem of the universe's specialness worsened

**Case (b)**
- Temperatures equal at time t0, no thermalization process
- Problem of specialness at t0 not worse than at t1
- Inflationary argument for uniformity different from case (a)
- Exponential expansion of inflationary phase serves to make universe uniform and spatially flat
- Need to understand 'generic' initial state

**Issues with Assuming Generic Initial State**
- Fractal sets do not smooth out with stretching
- Mandelbrot set as an example
- Reversing flow of time in collapsing universe model
  - Final stages have complex fractal-like geometry (generic Big Crunch)
- Real issue: Universe was very special at the Big Bang due to Second Law, not explained by inflationary processes

**Second Law and Uniformity of Universe**
- Universe was very special at the Big Bang for there to be a Second Law
- All thermalization processes depend on Second Law and do not explain it or the initial specialness
- Inflationary cosmology assumes FLRW spacetime geometry, provides no insight into generic case.

---

### 28.6: The anthropic principle

**Anthropic Principle**

**Background:**
- Concept that the universe's properties are such that it can produce and accommodate beings capable of observing it

**Weak Anthropic Principle:**
- Version focusing on specific conditions needed for sentient life (e.g., suitable planet)
- Example: Dicke and Carter's explanation of Dirac's coincidence

**Strong Anthropic Principle:**
- Extension where we determine fundamental physical constants to enable sentient life
- Potential belief in a 'Divine Purpose' or an ensemble of possible universes with varying constants

**Examples:**
1. Hoyle's discovery of unobserved carbon energy level for stellar nucleosynthesis
2. Neutron's mass slightly greater than proton's, enabling stable nuclei and chemistry

**Cautions:**
- Arguments from anthropic principle have uncertainties but not without significance
- Problems with strong form: determining actual constants of nature
- Strong form may lead to beliefs in a 'Divine Purpose'.

---

#### Cosmological Models, Anthropic Principle, and Universe Evolution Discussion

**The Anthropic Principle and Fundamental Physical Constants**

**Caution Regarding Use of the Anthropic Principle**:
- Extremely cautious about the strong anthropic principle
- Often used as a "cop-out" when theoretical considerations have reached their limit
- Theorists may say the unknown constant parameters will be determined by the anthropic principle
- Skeptical of this idea, as it seems to undermine the notion that physical laws are fixed

**The Anthropic Principle and a Spatially Infinite Universe**:
- If sentient life is possible at all in an infinite universe, we expect it to occur by chance
- The strong anthropic principle is "almost useless" for tuning physical parameters in such a universe
- Sentient life would still be expected to arise, even if extremely infrequently

**More Probable Circumstances for Intelligent Life**:
- If we find that the fundamental constants are of a certain value, we can ask about the most probable circumstances for intelligent life
- In the universe we know, with its specific constant values, the answer is "on some planet like Earth..."
- But for different constant values, the answer might be very different

**Wheeler's Proposal and the Anthropic Principle**:
- Wheeler proposed that the universe goes through cycles of expansion and contraction
- Each cycle might entail a change in the fundamental physical constants
- Lee Smolin suggested that the singularities inside black holes could produce new universes with slightly different constants
- The "natural selection" of universes might favor those with conditions conducive to the proliferation of black holes

**Critique of Wheeler and Smolin's Proposals**:
- The idea of some unknown physics converting singularities into a bounce is extremely speculative
- It is geometrically implausible that irregular singularities could convert themselves into an extraordinarily smooth Big Bang

### 28.7: The Big Bang’s special nature: an anthropic key?

**Anthropic Principle and Big Bang's Special Nature**

**Background:**
- The anthropic principle is used to explain the very special nature of the Big Bang in relation to life as we know it
- It argues that certain conditions must be met for sentient life to exist, such as a large universe with long enough timescales and conducive conditions
- Inflationary argument is sometimes used in conjunction with this principle

**Issue:**
- The precision required for the Big Bang of the nature we observe is one part in 10^123, which is too great to be explained by anthropic principle alone
- Smaller universe regions could potentially support sentient life, making the observed universe seem extravagant

**Counterarguments:**
- Not all components of the observable universe are necessary for our existence
- Life on Earth does not directly need certain conditions like microwave background radiation or Darwinian evolution
- Random creation of sentient beings from gas and radiation would be more likely than creating one large universe

**Implications:**
- The anthropic principle is insufficient to explain the special nature of the Big Bang, implying a need for scientific/mathematical theory
- A quantum gravity theory that determines the very nature of the Big Bang may hold potential answers.

### 28.8: The Weyl curvature hypothesis

**Weyl Curvature Hypothesis**

**Understanding Geometrical Constraints on Big Bang**:
- Focus on understanding geometrical constraints on Big Bang
- Postponing considerations of quantum gravity until Chapters 30-33

**Weyl Conformal Tensor**:
- Gravitational degrees of freedom described by the Weyl conformal tensor **Cabcd**
- In empty space (ignoring cosmological constant), spacetime curvature is entirely Weyl curvature
- Weyl curvature effects are distorting or tidal, not volume-reducing like Ricci curvature

**Effects of Weyl and Ricci Curvature on Timelike Geodesics**:
- Distorting effect of Ricci tensor due to matter distribution
- Astigmatic effect of Weyl tensor due to free gravitational field
- Eliminated by considering effects on null geodesics (light rays)

**Weyl Tensor vs. Ricci Tensor Effects on Null Geodesics**:
- **Ricci tensor**: Positively focusing lens, like a matter distribution
- **Weyl tensor**: Purely astigmatic lens, with positive and negative focussing in orthogonal planes

**Effect of Weyl Curvature on Star Patterns**:
- Looking through a transparent massive spherical body shows effects of Ricci and Weyl curvatures
- Positive magnification (Ricci tensor) inside the sphere's rim
- Astigmatic distortion (Weyl tensor) outside the sphere's rim, making a small circular pattern appear elliptical

**Weyl Curvature in Universe Evolution**:
- Initially uniform distribution of material corresponds to mainly Ricci curvature
- As material clumps into black holes, Weyl curvature increases, diverging at singularities
- FLRW models have vanishing (or extremely small) Weyl curvature initially

---

#### Constraints on Singularities and Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis in Gravitational Collapse

**Singularities and Cosmic Censorship**

**Distinction between Conformal Diagrams**
- Difficulty recognizing distinction between spacetime singularities in terms of conformal diagrams
- Black holes result from gravitational collapse, not worse outcomes (naked singularities)

**Cosmic Censorship**
- Unproved mathematical conjecture
- Asserts that a black hole forms during unstoppable gravitational collapse instead of a naked singularity
- Prevents visible spacetime singularities in physical universe
- Two kinds: initial or final singularities (Fig. 28.17b,c)

**Weyl Curvature Hypothesis**
- Asserts Weyl curvature is zero at initial singularities in the actual physical universe
- Results in a Second Law of thermodynamics as observed
- Good mathematical evidence supports this hypothesis*
- Constrains Creator's choice during the process of creation (Fig. 27.21)

**Additional Information:**
- Naked Singularities: Timelike singularities where signals can enter and leave
- Cosmic Censorship: Forbids timelike singularities, except in special situations
- Initial singularities: Resulting from gravitational collapse; causal signals can enter but not leave (Fig. 28.17b)
- Past singularities: In the Big Bang or localized creation events; causal signals can leave but not enter (Fig. 28.17c)

*Note 28.34 explanation: Cosmic Censorship and Weyl curvature hypothesis are mathematical conjectures related to spacetime singularities in general relativity. The former asserts that naked singularities do not occur in physical universe, while the latter imposes constraints on the Weyl curvature at initial singularities. Both are important for understanding the behavior of spacetime during gravitational collapse and the creation of the universe.

*Evidence for Weyl curvature hypothesis: Mathematical studies suggest that a specific form of this hypothesis adequately constrains the Big Bang to closely resemble an FLRW model in its early stages. This research provides strong support for the theory, but it has not been definitively proven yet.

Hints for exercises:
- Discuss the difference between conformal diagrams and real spacetime diagrams when considering singularities (Note 28.10)
- Show that areas are preserved for infinitesimal outward displacement, which varies inversely as distance out (exercise 28.11).

---

### 28.9: The Hartle–Hawking ‘no-boundary’ proposal

**The Hartle-Hawking 'no-boundary' Proposal**

**Background**:
- The Weyl curvature hypothesis is a claim about spacetime singularities, requiring theoretical justification
- Quantum gravity is often considered the domain of addressing these singularities
- However, there is still no consensus on the correct approach to uniting general relativity and quantum mechanics

**Hartle-Hawking Proposal**:
- Aimed to describe the relevant quantum theory for the Big Bang using a path-integral approach by Hawking
- Involved 'Euclideanization', which is a modification of Wick's idea of rotating coordinates into Euclidean space
- Allowed for Riemannian metrics (instead of Lorentzian) in the individual spacetimes within the path integral
- Proposed that these Riemannian metrics could provide a nonsingular way to 'close off' the Big Bang region

**Issues with Hartle-Hawking Proposal**:
1. **Euclideanization**:
   - Wick's original idea was to formulate a quantum field theory in Euclidean space and then rotate back to Lorentzian metrics
   - The Hartle-Hawking version involves applying the rotation to individual spacetimes within the path integral, which is a "leap of imagination" beyond Wick's original idea
2. **Path Integral Approximation**:
   - Path integrals are typically approximated by singling out certain terms and leaving out the rest
   - The analytic continuation process used to obtain physical answers is unreliable due to potential instability in the approximation
3. **Technical Difficulties with Euclideanization**:
   - It can be useful for producing exact model QFTs, but it's unclear if any particular theory of interest can be obtained using this method
   - Theories obtained via Euclideanization have hidden structures due to the 'wrong signature' associated symmetry group

**Conclusion**:
- The Hartle-Hawking proposal has some theoretical elegance, but also faces several issues related to the application of the 'Euclideanization' technique. The effectiveness and validity of this approach remain open questions in the pursuit of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics.

### 28.10: Cosmological parameters: observational status?

**Cosmological Parameters: Observational Status?**

**Hartle–Hawking No-Boundary Proposal**:
- Original form suggested closed (K > 0) universe
- Hawking later modified arguments to accommodate hyperbolic case (K < 0) due to mounting cosmological evidence favoring the hyperbolic case

**Inflationary Cosmology Expectations**:
- Long believed to have decisive implication that observed universe must be spatially flat (K = 0)
- Some inflationists subsequently modified arguments to allow for K < 0 in the face of cosmological data favoring negative spatial curvature

**Observational Position as of Now**:
- Significant evidence for positive cosmological constant (Λ > 0)
- This implies K = 0 is a possibility again
- All bets are off between K > 0 and K < 0 due to uncertainty

**Cosmological Evidence Against K > 0**:
- Total mass–energy content of the universe must be sufficient to close it with positive curvature (see Fig. 27.15a, b, c)
- Normal visible "baryonic" matter is insufficient to achieve critical density (Ωb = 0.03 instead of 1)
- Evidence for dark matter, which contributes about 10 times more mass–energy than visible matter

**Cosmological Constant Discovery**:
- Contradicts earlier belief that vacuum energy should be zero due to "cosmological constant problem"
- Observations of distant supernovae indicated accelerating expansion of the universe, consistent with a non-zero cosmological constant (Λ)

---

#### CMB Analysis and Cosmological Parameters Discrepancies with Inflation Theory

**Positive Cosmological Constant (Λ)**

**Discoveries:**
- Observed effective mass–energy density ΩΛ = 0.7, approximating total effective density Ω ≈ Ωd + ΩΛ = 1
- Inflationists celebrate as predictive success of their theory against seemingly powerful evidence to the contrary
- Uncertainties still too great for this conclusion to be carried with conviction

**Cosmological Observations:**
- Several measurements of microwave background temperature variations since COBE satellite launch in 1989
- WMAP space explorer's most recent survey analysis (at the time of writing)
- Results show oscillation patterns referred to as 'acoustic peaks' reflecting early universe matter concentration behavior

**Acoustic Peaks:**
- Reflect theory prediction that local concentrations of matter fall inward and rebound or fall through themselves, creating sonic oscillation
- Main peak occurs at typical scale governed by horizon scale at decoupling (Fig. 28.19)
- Spatial curvature of universe plays role in shifting acoustic peaks depending on K value

**Analysis Limitations:**
- Uncertainty regarding angular separation in sky to local distance separations in the early universe
- Expansion rate of the universe also plays a role, necessitating detailed calculations

**High vs Low Values of ℓ:**
- Results for high values of ℓ consistent with expectations of inflation and scale invariance
- Discrepancy seen at low values (ℓ = 2 or 'quadrupole moment'), implying breaking of scale invariance
- May indicate something about the early universe that is not fully understood yet

**Hidden Data:**
- WMAP temperature chart contains a wealth of information beyond what has been analyzed so far
- Alternative analysis method examining distortions in shape of distant regions due to intervening spatial curvature (Gurzadyan et al., 1992, 1994, 1997, 2002, 2003, 2004) could potentially reveal important insights about the early universe.

---

#### Cosmological Constant and Inflationary Cosmology: Implications and Controversies

**Ellipticity in Microwave Maps**
* Gurzadyan et al. found significant ellipticity in microwave maps from COBE, BOOMERANG, and WMAP
* Theoretical analysis suggests this degree of ellipticity can only occur with negative curvature (K < 0) due to "geodesic mixing"
* Results provide independent evidence for a positive cosmological constant of about the size implied by supernova data
* Analysis emphasizes a puzzle regarding the current values of Ωb, Ωd, and ΩΛ being approximately the same order of size

**Terminology for Cosmological Constant (Λ)**
* Standard terminology introduced by Einstein in 1917
* Often referred to as "dark energy" or "vacuum energy" instead
* Some cosmologists argue for a varying Λ due to early universe's large effective cosmological constant

**Constant vs. Variable Λ**
* Mathematical difficulties exist if Λ is not constant, requiring non-conservation of mass–energy
* Theoretically more comfortable to have Λ constant as consistent with observation

**Singularities and Spacetime Symmetry**
* Some cosmologists attempt to address singularity problem through inflation or Hartle–Hawking proposal
* Hawking's argument for applying the no-boundary proposal to final singularities of collapse faces difficulties without explicit time asymmetry in physical laws.

#### Quantum Mechanics and Cosmology: Singularity Time-Asymmetry Problem

**Chapter 30: Resolving Quantum-Mechanical Conundrums**

**Singularity Time-Asymmetry Problem**
- Faced with this issue in Chapter 30
- Related to something fundamentally puzzling left unresolved from quantum mechanics chapters

**Quantum Mechanics Conundrum**
- Idealization of a body of actual iron ignored for theoretical discussion
- Magnetized regions tend to become randomly oriented, iron as a whole does not magnetize easily
- Cooling through Curie point would need to be extremely slow to achieve significant magnetization

**Quantum-Mechanical Tunneling**
- Transition from one state to another of lower energy with emission of excess energy
- Occurs when quantum system cannot make the transition classically due to an energy barrier

**Reflection Symmetry Excluded**
- 'S' in SO(2) excludes reflection symmetry
- Appropriate group seems to be SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)/Z6

**Connection to Gauge Connections**
- Connection would initially be taken as a gauge connection on smaller bundle BL over M
- Knowledge of action on B L determines its action on tensors defined from L

**Red Shift z Defined**
- Measures the factor by which wavelength is increased
- Used in cosmic microwave background radiation analysis

**Possible Role for Quanglement Connection**
- Worth considering, but goes beyond current ideas of spontaneous symmetry breaking
- Influenced by conversations with George Sparling and Bikash Sinha

**Einstein's Theory 'Machian' After All?**
- Newer perspectives argue that Einstein's theory is 'Machian' after all
- Barbour (2004), Barbour et al. (2002), Raine (1975)

**Desiderata for Physical Theory**
- Aesthetic desiderata argued for in Mario Livio’s popular account, Livio (2000)

**Chaotic Cosmology Proposals**
- Precursor: 'chaotic cosmology' put forward independently by Misner and Zeldovich in the 1960s
- Belinskii et al. (1970) proposed a likely chaotic structure for this generic singularity

**Anthropic Principle**
- First heard of 'weak' anthropic idea from Fred Hoyle's radio talks in the 1950s
- Strong form addresses the issue of 'anthropic role of basic physical constants'
- Carter (1974), Barrow and Tipler (1988) break this down into several categories

**Dirac's Idea of Fine Tuning Constants**
- Roughly: cube root of age of universe in Planck units is remarkably closely the square root of ratio of electric to gravitational attraction between a proton and an electron
- Dirac (1938), Buckley and Peat (1996), Guenther et al. (1998)

**'Varying Constant' Idea**
- A recent proposal given an amusing account in Magueijo (2003)

---

#### Cosmic Censorship and Dark Matter Theories in Physics

**Implications for the Contents of Our Universe:**
- Hoyle et al. (1956), Burbidge et al. (1957) explored profound implications
- Hawking and Penrose (1970) introduced ideas related to quantum gravity
- Smolin (1997) expanded on these concepts

**The Special Nature of the Big Bang:**
- In a non-serious way, Penrose proposed an idea in his Adams Prize essay (1966) about physical constant readjustments
- Gravity was special at the Big Bang and apparently alone
- Alternative standpoint: Abhay Ashtekar suggested something else besides 'quantum gravity' may fix the extraordinary nature of the Big Bang

**The Role of Gravity:**
- Relevant is trace-free part of Ricci tensor, Rab – Rgab, cosmological constant plays no role (Penrose 1969a)
- Cosmic censorship concept: Penrose (1989) proposed that at any initial singularity there is a regular conformal geometry with boundary

**Techniques Used in Quantum Gravity:**
- Wick (1956) introduced technique used by Zinn-Justin (1996) in great effect
- Recent work suggests profound differences between Riemannian metrics and Lorentzian metrics (Ambjorn et al. 1999)

**Unconventional Ideas:**
- Milgrom's suggestion: no dark matter, alter Newtonian gravitational dynamics instead of Einstein’s
- Idea seems to fit facts remarkably well but lacks a coherent theory
- Mainstream interpretation: Krauss (2001) discusses dark matter and Perlmutter et al. (1998), Bahcall et al. (1999) present more mainstream views on the subject.

## 29. The measurement paradox 
###  29.1: The conventional ontologies of quantum theory

**The Measurement Paradox**

**Conventional Ontologies of Quantum Theory**:
- Explains many phenomena previously puzzling in the 19th century
- Includes: spectral lines, atomic stability, chemical bonds, material properties, ferromagnetism, phase transitions, black-body radiation, and biological matters like inheritance
- Also explains new phenomena like liquid crystals, superconductivity/superfluidity, lasers, Bose-Einstein condensates, non-locality, and quantum teleportation

**Quantum Mechanics Limitations**:
- Provides a "revolution in our picture of the real physical world" greater than general relativity
- Yet, some physicists view it as just a mathematical formalism, not revealing reality

**Two Extreme Views on Quantum States**:
- (a) No reality expressed in the quantum formalism: **Copenhagen interpretation**
  * Reality is only the classical world, experimenter's "knowledge" of the system jumps during measurement
- (b) The unitarily evolving quantum state completely describes reality with coexisting alternatives
  * Known as the **omnium**, a superposition of all possible universes

**The Measurement Problem/Paradox**:
- Conflict between deterministic U process and probabilistic R process in quantum mechanics
- Makes it hard to believe |ψ〉 represents physical reality after observation

---

#### Exploring Quantum Superposition and Interpretations in Physics

**Theories in Quantum Mechanics: Experimenter's States and Reality (b, a, c)**

**Experimenter's States Theories**
- **Proponents of (b):** argue for multiple 'worlds' with different outcomes based on experimenter's mind states being entangled with possible results.
  * Each world has a copy of the experimenter experiencing different outcomes but no communication between them.
  * Requirement of consistent awareness state leads to belief in one world.
- **Similarities**: Both (a) and (b) challenge how state vector |ψ> relates to reality.
  + In observed world, only one result appears physically real.
  + Formalism requires human perceptions for interpretation.

**Environmental Decoherence Theory (c)**
- Most prevalent pragmatic stance in quantum mechanics.
- Quantum system cannot be viewed in isolation from surroundings during measurement process.
- Entangled states arise with each alternative outcome and environmental states.
  * Unobservable details of environment are summed up using density matrices for description.
  + Important for understanding measurement problem but ontological status is unclear.
- **Positivist view**: Focuses on predicting results of measurements without concern for reality.

**My Position:**
- Crucial to resolve ontology issues in quantum mechanics despite current uncertainty.

---

### 29.2: Unconventional ontologies for quantum theory

**Unconventional ontologies for quantum theory**

**Three standpoints**:
- Not a comprehensive list, but represents common viewpoints in current literature
- Three additional ontologies: (d) consistent histories and (e) pilot wave
- (f) Present-day quantum mechanics is an approximation to something better

**Consistent histories approach (d)**:
- A generalization of standard framework for quantum theory
- Proponents provide an ontology like many worlds, but more extravagant
- Reality described as a continuous 1-parameter family of states in Hilbert space H
- No R here, only U evolution determined by Hamiltonian H
- Broadens to incorporate "R-type procedures" into its "evolution"

**Projector set and projection postulate**:
- A projector is an operator that squares to itself and is Hermitian
- Projectors E1,...,Er are orthogonal and sum to the identity I on Hilbert space H
- The role of the projector Ej in measurement represented by operator Q:
  - Projects down to the eigenvector space corresponding to the eigenvalue qj of Q
  - The projection postulate tells us that if result is qj, |ψ⟩ jumps to (something proportional to) Ej|ψ⟩ with probability 〈ψ|Ej|ψ⟩

**Consistent histories approach ontology**:
- Operates with entities called coarse-grained histories, which resemble Schrödinger's omnium of the many-worlds approach

---

#### Quantum Mechanics: Guiding Wave Functions and Multiple Reality Viewpoints.

**Consistent Histories Viewpoint (d)**
* Projector sets allow refinement of coarse-grained histories, but do not represent fundamental changes to reality
* Coarse-grained histories are based on classical phase space, with projectors providing alterations to 'coarse-graining boxes'
* Consistent histories: probabilities satisfy ordinary classical rules and provide strong candidates for ontologically real entities
* Maximally refined sets of coarse-grained histories provide a stronger candidate for reality
* Advantage over Many Worlds Viewpoint (b): correct quantum probabilities are provided by theory

**Bohmian Pilot Wave Theory (e)**
* Ontological position: particle's actual position is ontologically real, while ψ serves as a 'guiding wave'
* Two levels of reality: firmer level is the classical configuration of the system; weaker level is the complex function ψ
* Subtleties: non-local nature of ψ and conditions for probability distribution in initial state
* Questionable assumption that all measurements can be reduced to position measurements, especially for non-classical parameters.

---

#### Exploring Quantum Measurement and Operators' Eigenvalues

**Discussion on Different Ontological Positions in Quantum Mechanics (f)**
* Clarity of ontological position of (e) is commendable, though more issues to be addressed in §29.9
* Proposed theories under standpoint (f):
  * Accept real status for evolving state vector |ψ> as a provisional stance
  * Time-evolution approximates alternation of U and R
  * Both quantum mechanical evolution processes taken seriously ontologically to describe reality
  * Trouble with unitarity due to lack of determinism in R and mathematically inconsistent with U
* Comparison between U and R:
  * 'Squared-modulus rule' preserves probability conservation through unitary time evolution
  * Integral part of the wonders of quantum mechanics, making changes difficult for some physicists
* Necessity for Changes in Quantum Theory:
  * Respectful revolutionary changes required instead of tinkering with present-day physics principles.

**Measurement Problem and Eigenvalues (f)**
* Explanation of why Ej |ψ> is the result of a measurement given by Q applied to |ψ>, where Q = q1E1 + q2E2 + ...+ qrEr and qj are distinct real numbers.
* Proof for finite-dimensional Hermitian operator having this form: assume any finite-dimensional Hermitian matrix Q can be transformed into a diagonal matrix by unitary transformation.
* Modifications needed for normal operator Q.

---

### 29.3: The density matrix

**The Density Matrix**
- The density matrix is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, particularly for standpoint (c)
- It plays an important role in many other quantum-mechanical considerations
- Represents the state of a system whose state is not completely known
- Composed of a list of possible states, each assigned a probability
  - Probabilities sum to unity: p + q + ... = 1
  - Each state normalized: ||ψ|| = ||ϕ|| = ... = 1
- Defined as the quantity D
  - D is a Hermitian matrix (D* = D)
  - Non-negative definite (Dαβ ≥ 0 for all ξ)
  - Of trace unity: Trace(D) = Dαβ

**Role in Quantum Mechanics**
- Analogous to probability distribution in classical statistical mechanics
- Represents a system as a set of points P, Q, ... in Hilbert space H, each assigned a probability value p, q, ...
  - Contrast to the continuous distribution in phase space P
- The density matrix combines both the classical probabilities and quantum probabilities into one expression
- Allows for calculating probabilities of yes/no questions without needing complete information on alternative states.

---

### 29.4: Density matrices for spin ½: the Bloch sphere

**Spin and Density Matrices**

**Simple Example**:
- Particle of spin 1/2 with states |Ψ₁⟩ and |Ψ₂⟩, each having a probability of 1/2
- Measuring spin in up/down direction: classical probabilities
- Measuring spin in left/right direction: quantum probabilities from the squared modulus law
- Probabilities for left or right measurements are the same regardless of measurement direction

**Density Matrix**:
- Density matrix ρ for a system is defined as ρ = |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|, where |Ψ⟩ is a normalized state vector
- For the example above, all density matrices ρ for the equal-probability mixture are the same
- Probabilities of outcomes from measurements on the density matrix can be obtained using the formula: P(m) = tr(ρM), where M is an observable represented by a matrix

**Ontology of Mixtures**:
- If the quantum state has physical reality, then the different probability mixtures are ontologically distinct
- Some physicists might regard the density matrix as providing a better description of reality than individual states
- This view could lead to confusion about the distinction between pure and mixed states

**Pure vs. Mixed States**:
- Pure state: quantum state vector |Ψ⟩ normalized by 〈Ψ|Ψ⟩ = 1
- Mixture: density matrix (not equivalent to a pure state)

**Bloch Sphere**:
- Represents the space of density matrices for a 2-state system

---

#### Bloch Sphere Interpretation of Density Matrices for Two-State Systems

**Bloch Sphere B3**

**Bloch Sphere Representation**:
- Closed solid sphere or 3-ball in Euclidean 3-space, representing density matrices for spin systems (or other 2-state systems)
- General Hermitian 2x2 matrix of trace unity:
  - a, b, c: real numbers
  - Must be non-negative definite to be a density matrix: a² + b² + c² ≤ 1
- Boundary S2 represents pure states in the 2-state system and can be identified with the Riemann sphere S2

**Density Matrix Interpretation**:
- Origin D of the Bloch sphere (general density matrix) represents a probability mixture of all possible pure states
- Points L in the interior of B3 represent non-pure density matrices with ambiguous ontological interpretations
  - Can be interpreted as a probability mixture between any pair of pure states P1 and P2 on the boundary S2
  - The only specific property of D is that all pure state pairs are orthogonal; this is not required for all density matrices

**Exercises**:
- Explain why D has an ambiguous ontological interpretation, and derive the expression ⟨ED⟩ (answer below)
- Can you see why this should be so?
- Work through the calculation of P(θ) using the expression (l + cos θ) from §22.9 for the probability (answer below)
- Show that the family of pure state density matrices correspond to linear combinations w|ψ⟩ + z|φ⟩ for some arbitrary pair of fixed states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩ (answer below)
- Prove that a, b, c product must be non-negative (answer below)

### 29.5: The density matrix in EPR situations

**Density Matrix in EPR Situations**

**Situation**:
- An EPR pair of spin particles emitted with combined state of spin 0
- Particle emitted towards Earth and Titan (approximately twice as far from Earth)
- Colleague on Titan measures particle spin before signal can reach Earth
- Measurement result unknown to Earth observer until after their own measurement

**Density Matrix Description**:
- Observer assigns density matrix D with equal probability of finding | 
  〉 or | 
  〉 states
- Density matrix provides excellent description if no information from Titan is received
- If direction of colleague's measurement known, ontology view may change but probability estimations remain unaffected
- If message received from Titan, probability estimates may be affected and consistency requirements apply

**Special Case**:
- Particles initially in spin 1 state with density matrix having all eigenvalues equal (implies no distinction between bases)
- This is a result of the simple situation considered and not representative of general density matrices

**Modifying Example**:
- Initial state changed to |   
  〉 = | 
  〉| 
  〉 + | 
  〉| 
  〉 (Majorana description with tangent of angle between and )
- Colleague performs right/left measurement on particle arriving on Titan
- Observer concludes that received particle is a probability mixture of | 
  〉 and | 
  〉 if colleague's measurement known.

#### Density Matrix and Bell State Measurement on Titan

**Density Matrix Calculation**

**Background:**
- Density matrix represents probability mixture of states
- Not orthogonal for all probabilities
- Ontology depends on measurement direction and number of dimensions in Hilbert space

**Example:**
- Two possible outcomes: | 
  〉 with probability 0.4, | 
  〉 with probability 0.6
- Density matrix: $\begin{pmatrix} 0.6 & 0\\ 0 & 0.4 \end{pmatrix}$

**Calculating a Density Matrix**
1. Write the initial state as an entangled state, e.g., $|ψ\rangle = |αρ\rangle$
2. Calculate Hermitian conjugate: $\langleψ| = |\overline{ρ}\overline{α}\rangle$
3. Normalize: $|\langleψ|ψ\rangle| = 1$
4. Find density matrix for each location:
   - Earth: $D_{earth} = \frac{1}{2}\langleψ|⊗I|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0.6 & 0\\ 0 & 0.4 \end{pmatrix}$
   - Titan: $D_{titan} = \frac{1}{2}|\overline{ρ}\overline{α}\rangle⊗I|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\ 0.4 & 0.6 \end{pmatrix}$
5. Diagrammatic notation: Fig. 29.5 in text

### 29.6: FAPP philosophy of environmental decoherence

**Environmental Decoherence: FAPP Philosophy**
* Idea that state reduction can be understood as a result of system becoming entangled with environment (here part and there part)
* Environment seen as complicated, random, no way to extract information fully
* Density matrix description used for here part, summing unknown states in environment
* Interpretations of density matrices are debated, no absolute truth
* Resort to density matrix is technology-dependent
* Pragmatic convenience rather than fundamental reality (FAPP)
* Ideas about deep principles leading to loss of phase relations: quantum fluctuations in gravitational field or black holes
* Debate on nature of space-time at Planck scale, possibility of detailed phase relations getting lost
* Any density matrix is diagonal in some basis when all eigenvalues are unequal.

### 29.7: Schrödinger’s cat with ‘Copenhagen’ ontology

**Schrödinger's Cat and the 'Copenhagen' Ontology**

**The Measurement Problem**:
- Describes a paradox in quantum mechanics:
- The idea of a cat being both dead and alive at the same time based on superposition states

**Copenhagen Interpretation**:
- Schrödinger's equation (U) requires that the two subsequent time-evolutions persist in constant complex-number-weighted superposition
- Leads to an absurd situation of a cat being both dead and alive at the same time
- According to Copenhagen viewpoint:
  - The photon detector is considered a "classical measuring device" where quantum superposition rules are not applied
  - The wavefunction is used only for calculating probabilities
  - The correct physical answer lies in the behavior of the world as experienced, not in the details of what goes on inside a detector
- This interpretation provides an unsatisfactory picture if one wishes to pursue the physical events in greater detail
- It does not resolve the question of why and at what stage "classical behavior" arises for large and complicated structures like detectors

**Other Variants of Copenhagen Interpretation**:
- The "classical measuring apparatus" is ultimately the observer's consciousness
- According to this view, R only occurs when a conscious experimenter examines the cat
- This theory demands the presence of a conscious observer to effect R and leads to an implausible picture of the universe

**Alternatives**:
- If U rules continue to hold at the level of a conscious being, it would imply the many-worlds perspective (b)
- If U fails for conscious beings, it would require some new behavior outside the ordinary predictions of quantum mechanics (f)

**Conclusion**:
- The idea that the presence of consciousness is necessary to effect R raises questions about the believability of this picture as an actual physical universe.

---

### 29.8: Can other conventional ontologies resolve the ‘cat’?

**Many-Worlds Standpoint (b) and Cat Paradox**

**Acceptance of Quantum Superposition:**
- Reality accepts the quantum superposition of a live and dead cat
- Does not explain what an observer perceives

**Entangled Perception State:**
- Assumes observer's perception state is entangled with the cat's states
- Observer finds their perception in either 'live cat' or 'dead cat'

**Fig. 29.8:**

- The conclusion of Fig. 29.7 is unaffected by different environments or observer responses
- State takes form |Ψ⟩ = w × |live cat⟩|live cat’s environment⟩|perceiving live cat⟩ + z × |dead cat⟩|dead cat’s environment⟩|perceiving dead cat⟩

**Unresolved Issues:**
- Formalism of quantum mechanics doesn't demand against simultaneous perception of live and dead cats
- We don't know what it means for a state of consciousness to be involved in the perception

**Fig. 29.9:**

- Re-expressing Fig. 29.8: √8|Ψ⟩ = (|live cat⟩ + |dead cat⟩)(|perceiving live cat⟩ + |perceiving dead cat⟩) + (|live cat⟩ – |dead cat⟩)(|perceiving live cat⟩ – |perceiving dead cat⟩)

**Equal Amplitudes:**
- Not as important as orthogonality in understanding the many worlds view
- In general, there is not freedom to re-express entangled states like this

**Schmidt Decomposition:**
- A unique pair of orthogonal perception states accompanying a pair of orthogonal cat states (known as Schmidt decomposition)
- However, these eigenstates may not be the desired live and dead cat at all but some unwanted linear superpositions

#### Quantum Cat Paradox Resolution with Environmental Decoherence: No Consistent Ontological Interpretation

**Understanding the Cat Paradox Resolutions**

**Superpositions of Macroscopic States:**
- Eigenvectors of density matrices for Earth and Titan are different
- No theory explains why superpositions don't occur in perceived world
- Need a theory of perception to make sense of it (theory lacking)

**Environmental Decoherence Resolution:**
- Initial emission of photon as real, ontologically
- After beam splitter: superposition of photon in both beams
- Transmitted part evolves into dead cat and its environment
- Reflected part evolves into live cat and a different environment
- Ontological position shifts from superposition to density matrix
- Environmental decoherence argument asserts diagonal matrix, shifting ontology again
- State becomes a probability mixture of |live cat⟩ and |dead cat⟩

**Issues with Environmental Decoherence:**
- FAPP (fudge, approximate, and paper over) solution
- No consistent ontology for physical reality

### 29.9: Which unconventional ontologies may help?

**Unconventional Ontologies for Quantum Mechanics:**
- Discussing five unconventional ontologies: (d) Consistent histories approach and (e) de Broglie–Bohm 'pilot-wave' viewpoint.

**Consistent Histories Approach (d):**
- Reality represented as a totality of maximally refined consistent-history sets.
- Criticism: Detailed theory of conscious perceivers needed to create consistent picture with physical world.
- Alternative: Single maximally refined consistent history set.
- Depends on 'consistency' condition being adequate for modeling observed reality, but Dowker and Kent demonstrated that it is not enough.
- Major drawback: No clear understanding of physical measurements or how they differ from R-like procedures.

**de Broglie–Bohm Pilot-Wave Viewpoint (e):**
- Clearest ontology among those not altering quantum theory predictions.
- Criticism: Difficulty defining which systems accord with classical pictures and when quantum behavior becomes important.
- No measurable scale measure needed for addressing the paradox of Schrödinger's cat.

**General Comment:**
- Ordinary dynamics alone cannot achieve R phenomena, probabilistic principle is necessary.
- Consistent histories approach requires appropriate successive probabilities of measurements being encoded in initial state choice.

#### Discussion of Quantum Realities and Ontologies in Physics

**Chapter 29: Discussing Proposed Objective Realities in Quantum Mechanics**

**Key Points:**
- (f) is the most likely objective reality proposal, as discussed in Chapter 30
- Unnatural appearance, non-relativistic character, arbitrary parameters, energy violation, and observation conflict are issues with proposed solutions
- Pragmatic stance does not address ontological issues
- Gell-Mann and Hartle (d), Bohm and Hiley (e) are representative of different standpoints within the class covered by (b)
- Consistency condition on coarse-grained histories: no interference between compared histories when Schrödinger evolution is ignored
- My attempt at understanding the intended '(d)-ontology' based on discussions with Jim Hartle and Fay Dowker

**Section 29.1:**
- Significant stimulation from various proposals, including Gell-Mann and Hartle (d), Bohm and Hiley (e)
- Represents a general class covered by (b) but has important elements in common with (d)
- Transactional ontologies: Aharonov and Vaidman, Cramer, Costa de Beauregard, Werbos and Dolmatova
- No clear statement of underlying intended '(d)-ontology' from consistent histories literature

**Section 29.2:**
- Formalism (d) allows a density matrix as the 'starting state' (final state could be a density matrix Đ∞)
- Consistency condition demands that real part of X vanish when any pair of projectors are unequal
- Strictly the case only when Schrödinger part is ignored but can be reinstated by introducing evolution between applications of projectors
- Interpreted as the condition of 'no interference' between histories being compared.

**Section 29.3:**
- Continuous probability distribution requires a non-negative real-valued function f on P that integrates to 1
- Natural volume form, the Σ of §20.4, used for integration
- Required condition is ʃ f Σ = 1.

#### Exploring Quantum Entanglement and Consistent Histories in Quantum Information Theory.

**Nielsen and Chuang's Discussion of Density Matrix in Quantum Mechanics**

**29.4**: For an n-state system with n > 2, only part of the (n-2)-dimensional space of density matrices is the space of pure states, which is a complex projective (n-1)-space. (See §21.9 and §22.9)

**29.5**: The concept of "quanglement" introduced in §23.10 may affect ontological issues related to quantum contexts. It may be that the entire notion of "ontology" will have to be re-evaluated.

**29.6**: The idea of using consciousness to reduce the state is originally due to Wheeler. A modern perspective can be found in Ng (2004).

**29.7**: Wigner's position on quantum measurement may have evolved over time; the author is uncertain if this represents his actual stance. The author's own viewpoint fundamentally differs from those who assert that consciousness reduces the state. (See §30.9–12)

**29.8**: The Schmidt decomposition of an entangled state |Ψ⟩ belonging to H₂ × H₂ expresses it uniquely as |Ψ⟩ = λ|α⟩|β⟩ + µ|ρ⟩|σ⟩, where |α⟩ and |ρ⟩ are normalized eigenstates of its density matrix. A similar expression holds for Hn × Hn. (See Nielsen and Chuang, 2000)

**29.9**: Gell-Mann (1994), Hartle (2004) discuss these issues in the context of "consistent histories".

**Quanglement's Impact on Ontological Issues**:
- **Question**: How might quanglement affect ontological issues?
- **Possibility**: The entire notion of "ontology" may have to be re-evaluated.

**Wigner's Position on Quantum Measurement**:
- The author is uncertain if this represents Wigner's actual position regarding quantum measurement, which may have evolved during his life.
- **Author's Own Viewpoint**: Fundamentally differs from those who assert that consciousness reduces the state. (See §30.9–12)

**Schmidt Decomposition of an Entangled State**:
- For a general entangled state |Ψ⟩ belonging to H₂ × H₂, it can be expressed uniquely as: |Ψ⟩ = λ|α⟩|β⟩ + µ|ρ⟩|σ⟩
- Similar expression holds for Hn × Hn. (See Nielsen and Chuang, 2000)

**Consistent Histories Approach**:
- **Gell-Mann (1994), Hartle (2004)** discuss these issues in the context of "consistent histories".

## 30. Gravity’s role in quantum state reduction 
###  30.1: Is today’s quantum theory here to stay?

**Chapter 30: Gravity's Role in Quantum State Reduction**

**Is Today’s Quantum Theory Here to Stay?**
- Author argues for change in fundamental rules of quantum mechanics based on positive reasons, despite theory's exceptional experimental support and confirmed predictions.
- Comparison of the age of quantum mechanics to Newton's theory:
  - Quantum mechanics is approximately three-quarters of a century old (from establishment of mathematical theory).
  - Newtonian theory lasted for nearly three times as long before needing serious modification through special and general relativity.
- Linearity in quantum theory leads into measurement paradox, suggesting possible non-linearity approximation.
- Precedent from Einstein's general relativity:
  - Newtonian gravitational forces add up linearly but are replaced by subtle non-linear effects in Einstein's theory.
  - Modifications to Newton's theory proposed before were not as radical as Einstein's theory change.
- Author suggests looking towards modifications similar to those in general relativity for changes needed in quantum mechanics.
- Two fundamental revolutions of physical thought:
  - General relativity and quantum theory (or field theory).
- Common perspective is that one theory must submit itself to the other, with few suggesting modification of quantum rules.
- Author argues for non-standard union between general relativity and quantum mechanics based on observational evidence, emphasizing objective state reduction as an important feature.

### 30.2: Clues from cosmological time asymmetry

**Clues from Cosmological Time Asymmetry**

**Nature's choice of quantum-gravity union**:
- Revealed through spacetime singularities of Big Bang and black holes (and possibly Big Crunch)
- Gross time-asymmetry is a necessary feature for Nature's quantum-gravity union

**Issues with Standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**:
- CPT theorem, which applies to standard QFT, suggests initial singularity as possibility for the Big Bang
- Enormous available phase space in generic final singularities of gravitational collapse
- No guiding principle to pinpoint the actual starting point of our universe (region B)

**Proposed Solutions**:
- Mystery of the special nature of the Big Bang cannot be resolved within standard framework of quantum field theory
- Symmetry breaking in quantum theory compared to classical Einstein's theory is a possibility, but hard to make sense of
- Anomalies in quantization might not share symmetries with classical theory, but usually regarded as things to be avoided
- Discrete symmetry violation (CPT) seems unrelated to usual anomaly idea that refers to continuous symmetries

**Conclusion**:
- Gravity behaves differently from other fields in extreme circumstances where quantum effects and gravitational effects must both come together (spacetime singularities at the Big Bang and in gravitational collapse).

---

### 30.3: Time-asymmetry in quantum state reduction

**Time Asymmetry in Quantum State Reduction**

**Perception of Time-Asymmetry**:
- Perceived time-asymmetry in R, the process of quantum state reduction
- Contrast with U part of quantum theory where no time-asymmetry is perceived (§27.1)

**Experiment Demonstrating Time-Asymmetry**:
- Hypothetical quantum experiment: photon source S emits single high-energy photons, recorded by a detector D upon reaching the beam splitter B or being absorbed into the ceiling C (route SBD or SBC)
- When asked to predict probabilities based on the observed event at D:
  - Correct answer using R's squared-modulus rule: 50% probability of detection at D, and 50% probability for photon reaching C when there is an emission event at S
  - Reverse time direction: incorrectly predicted probabilities of 1 and 0 (should be 100% emission at S, 0% from the floor F)
- Squared-modulus rule was not designed to apply into the past, but demonstrates the incorrectness of such an application

**Probability Computation for Future vs. Past**:
- If we know the amplitudes, we can calculate future probabilities
- To compute past probabilities, we need to consider detailed circumstances in addition to the amplitudes
- There are situations where quantum probabilities can be computed symmetrically in time, such as when a state is measured before and after an intermediate measurement

**Conclusion**:
- Most quantum measurements do not have this symmetry of computation for past and future probabilities.

---

#### Quantum State Evolution and Time-Reversal in Quantum Mechanics

**Quantum Probabilities and Squared-Modulus Rule**

**Normal Forward-Time Use:**
- No specification required for |ϕ⟩
- Calculate quantum probabilities without issue

**Backward-Time Attempted Use:**
- Cannot get away with not specifying |ψ⟩
- Connection to Second Law and measurement question
  * Intimate relation between R and anticipated union with quantum gravity
  * Actual measuring devices utilize Second Law in operation
- Other aspects of R:
  * 'Jumping' of quantum state
    * Can be phrased according to forward or backward time perspectives
    * Schematically illustrated in Fig. 30.2a,b
  * Calculation of amplitudes remains the same regardless of viewpoint adopted
- Time-reversed perspective has a 'teleological' aspect that some find disturbing
- Quanglement perspective: connections between states at different times but not important for time direction of propagation.

**Schema Illustration:**
*Fig. 30.2*
  * Standard time-direction of evolution (a)
    - Operator eigenstates occur at past end of each stretch of U evolution
  * Time-reversed viewpoint of evolution (b)
    - Operator eigenstates occur at future end of each stretch of U evolution
  * In transactional interpretation, two state vectors evolve simultaneously according to both pictures.

### 30.4: Hawking’s black-hole temperature

**Black Hole Temperature and Entropy (Hawking's Argument)**
* **Background:** Hawking's argument connects black hole temperature with entropy, addressing the issue of time asymmetry in quantum gravity theory. The discussion includes two connections: one based on black-hole evaporation and entropy implications (Section 30.4 – 30.9) and another from a fundamental tension between general relativity and quantum mechanics principles (Sections 30.10 – 13).
* **Black Hole Evaporation:**
  * A black hole has temperature T BH, proportional to surface gravity
  * Emits photons as if it were in thermal equilibrium
  * Radiates energy with a Planckian spectrum for the given temperature
  * Temperature is very low compared to a solar mass black hole (≈10-7 K)
* **Hawking's Calculation:**
  * Derived black-hole entropy S BH from Bekenstein–Hawking expression
  * Obtained Hawking temperature and 'surface gravity' in the entropy formula using techniques of quantum field theory (QFT) in a curved background spacetime
* **Challenges:**
  * Formulating quantum theory within a curved background poses severe problems, especially finding an appropriate notion of 'positive frequency' for quantum particles and QFT.

**Black Hole Temperature and Entropy (Hawking's Argument) - Stationarity of Spacetime**
* **Stationary Spacetimes:**
  * A black hole in a stationary spacetime has a continuous family of time-displacements that preserve the geometry.
* **Timelike Killing Vector:**
  * The timelike Killing vector κ generates stationarity and allows for specifying a natural 'time parameter' t.
* **Connection to Black Hole Temperature and Entropy:**
  * Considerations of stationary spacetimes provide plausible results regarding black hole temperature and entropy.

---

#### Quantum Field Theory and Black Hole Temperature Concepts

**Positive Frequency and Unruh Effect**

**Background:**
- Multiple timelike Killing vectors lead to multiple notions of positive frequency in Minkowski space
- Agree when passing between inertial frames, but not accelerating ones
- Results in a thermal vacuum state for an accelerating observer

**Unruh Effect:**
- Surprising effect: acceleration temperature is real temperature measured by an idealized thermometer undergoing uniform acceleration in a vacuum
- Thermometer experiences effective temperature due to equivalence principle and ambient vacuum with zero temperature
- Notion of positive frequency disagrees between inertial and accelerating frames

**Avoiding Issues:**
- Some approaches abandon the notion of 'particle' and focus on quantum-mechanical operator algebra
- Merits of this type of theory still being assessed by the author

**Hawking's Calculation:**
- Requires only standard notion of positive/negative frequency splitting at J+ and J– (past null infinity)
- Difference between these notions leads to production of Hawking's thermal state by black hole, resulting in Hawking radiation
- Significance lies in the fact that some information defined at J– gets lost in the singularity and does not make it out to J+.

---

### 30.5: Black-hole temperature from complex periodicity

**Gibbons and Perry Argument for Black Hole Temperature**

**Background:**
- Gibbons and Perry derived Hawking temperature in 1976 using complexification of solutions to Einstein equation (Schwarzschild or Kerr)
- Complexified space implies regularity condition on quantities leading to periodicity in complex time with purely imaginary period

**Complexification**:
- Extending real solution to complex values of coordinates
- In case of Lorentzian section:
  * r is still real and non-negative, but θ becomes imaginary
  * t = iy serves as time coordinate for Lorentzian section
  * Coordinate r measures Lorentzian spatial distance from origin
  * τ (multiplied by a constant) can be interpreted as 'time' for an observer uniformly accelerating away from the center

**Implications**:
- Functions analytic at origin O must have an imaginary period in τ with period 2πi
- This is based on periodicity of smooth quantities in Euclidean space and applies to full 4D black hole geometry.

---

#### Discussion of Black Hole Temperature Derivation in Schwarzschild Spacetime

**Maximally Extended Schwarzschild Spacetime**
- **'Eternal Black Hole'**: Analog of origin O in 𝕄 2
- **Schwarzschild Space K**: Eternally existing, not created from collapse
- **Analogue of Euclidean space 𝔼 2**: 'Euclideanized' Schwarzschild space G
- **Imaginary periodicity**: Characteristic of a thermal state with temperature β in G
- **Regularity at O**: Any regular quantity must be periodic with period 2πiβ in τ
- **Physical justification for argument**
  - Questionable for actual physical black holes
    * Created from gravitational collapse
    * Not well described by full model of Fig. 30.6a
  - Appropriate for describing a collapse to a black hole
    * Region above and right of outer boundary line lies in K's metric
    * Deviations from exact Schwarzschild/Kerr metric can be expected
- **Exact stationary black-hole model**
  - Ultimate limit of realistic collapse with all irregularities ironed out
  - Provides 'strong indication' of inner consistency for the idea of a 'black-hole temperature'

**Comparison to Brandon Carter Observation**
- Stationary charge-free black hole described by Kerr parameters m and a (mass, angular momentum)
- Newman's generalization: Kerr–Newman metric for electrically charged rotating black hole.

---

#### Examining the Electron's Gyromagnetic Ratio in Relation to Black Holes and Complex Coordinates

**Key Points:**

**Three Parameters**:
- m: mass
- a: angular momentum
- e: electric charge
- Magnetic moment M = ae, direction agrees with angular momentum

**Carter's Observation:**
- Gyromagnetic ratio for black hole is fixed (independent of m, a, e)
- Takes the same value as Dirac predicted for electron
- Does not provide derivation of gyromagnetic ratio

**Argument's Limitations:**
- Cannot apply to electrons due to mass, angular momentum, and electric charge values
- Violates inequality m^2 >= a^2 + e^2 necessary for black hole representation in Kerr–Newman metric

**Gibbons–Perry Argument**:
- Reveals "naturalness" of black hole temperature through extensions into complex space
- Not constrained to Schwarzschild/Kerr family of metrics
- Commonly accepted as derivation due to revealing "naturalness" but not an actual one in opinion.

---

### 30.6: Killing vectors, energy flow—and time travel!

**Killing Vectors, Energy Flow, and Time Travel**

**The Eternal Black Hole**:
- Illustrates mathematical features important for §§30.7,10
- Has two distinct past null infinities (J – and J –′) and two distinct future null infinities (J + and J +′)
- Represents a time-evolution of two different universes that become connected by a 'wormhole'
- Each universe contains a black hole that is also a 'white hole' at the same time

**Killing Vectors**:
- Illustrates the stationarity of the black/white hole in the external regions ε and ε′
- The Killing vector κ is timelike in the external regions, but spacelike in the internal regions B – and B +
- In the future region ε′, the conserved energy-density quantity obtained from contracting the energy–momentum tensor with the Killing vector provides a negative energy density for normal matter compared to the positive energy density in ε

**Attempts at Time Travel**:
- Some theoreticians attempt to modify the spacetime model to allow for time travel
- Attempts are motivated by the desire to transcend the limitations of relativity and achieve 'Star Trek'-like space travel
- Attempts are not based on a solid physical understanding, but may provide guidance in exploring quantum gravity ideas

---

### 30.7: Energy outflow from negative-energy orbits

**Hawking Temperature and Radiation from Black Holes**

**Black Hole Temperature:**
- Hawking's intuitive derivation of Hawking radiation
  * Virtual particle–antiparticle pairs produced near black hole horizon
  * Particles fall into the hole, others escape with positive energy
- Negative energies possible for real particles inside black hole due to spacelike Killing vector κa in interior region B+
- Real particle's energy measured as negative pa κa from infinity (conserved energy)
- Similar process occurs with classical rotating black holes and astrophysical implications.

**Hawking Radiation:**
- Virtual particle-antiparticle pairs produced, annihilate shortly after
- Near hole's horizon: one particle falls into the hole, other escapes
  * Real particles instead of virtual ones become involved
  * Energy conservation demands negative energy for ingoing particle
  * Escaping particle carries positive energy

**Classical Rotating Black Holes:**
- Similar process as Hawking radiation but with significant astrophysical implications
- Ergosphere region outside the horizon where Killing vector κ becomes spacelike
- Particles can have negative conserved energy while communicating with external universe
* Fig. 30.12 illustrates this concept: a) Views 'down' along time axis of rotating (Kerr) black hole, b) Ergosphere and Penrose process for extracting rotational energy.

---

### 30.8: Hawking explosions

**Hawking Explosions**

**Temperature of a Black Hole**:
- For a 1 Mʘ black hole, the temperature is extremely low (about 10–7 K)
- The temperature for larger black holes would be even lower in inverse proportion to their mass
- There is no astrophysical evidence for black holes less than about 1 Mʘ

**Radiation of a Black Hole**:
- In an expanding universe, the ambient temperature will eventually become lower than that of a black hole
- After this point, the black hole would start to lose energy by radiating more than it absorbs from the background
- As it loses energy, the black hole's radius decreases and its temperature increases, leading to an "explosion" where the remaining mass-energy is converted into radiation

**Alternative Scenarios**:
- Some physicists argue that the black hole would not completely disappear, but leave a "remnant" or "nugget" of information
- Others suggest that all the information returns in the final explosion

**Uncertainty with Information Loss**:
- Some researchers argue against information loss because it violates unitarity (the immutability of U)
- The most probable scenario is that the collapsing material falls across the horizon and is destroyed, without any signal being emitted

**Scaling of Black Hole Size**:
- A black hole with a million solar masses would have a much larger horizon and spacetime curvature than a 1 Mʘ black hole
- It is inconceivable that all the information in such a large black hole could be signaled out before its collapse

---

#### Hawking's Argument for Black Hole Information Loss: Consequences for Quantum Unitarity and Evolution

**Black Holes: The Collapse Process (Spherically Symmetrical Case)**

**Fig. 30.15**: Strict conformal diagram of black hole process, conveying clear picture in accordance with loss
- Material collapsing appears to fall across horizon and is destroyed at singularity

**The Horizon's Location**:
- Precise location determined 'teleologically' based on ultimately falling material into the hole
- Cosmic censorship enforces this conclusion, with little room for disagreement

**Return of Information (POP in Fig. 30.14)**:
- Standpoint: All collapsing material's information comes back at event of final explosion
- Explaining how this information manages to escape singularity is not plausible

**The Situation with Nuggets**:
- Even if nugget formed, it's not useful due to locked-in information forever
- Consistent QFT for nuggets would require formulation difficulties

**Hawking's Argument and Position**:
- Unitarity must be violated in certain situations when general relativity and quantum mechanics combine
- Hawking argues strongly for loss, with a position that unitarity is violated but mildly
- Evolution of quantum state into non-pure-state density matrix proposed for handling lost parts of entangled states.

---

### 30.9: A more radical perspective

**Radical Perspective on Loss and Information in the Universe**

**Agreeing with Hawking but Going Further:**
- Belief in loss of information in black holes is correct, but something more radical is needed
- Incorporating time-asymmetry features like white holes and their time reversals

**Time Symmetrical Situations:**
- Violation of Weyl curvature hypothesis (§28.8)
- Creation of new information during destruction (Figs. 30.16, 30.17)
- Absurd proposals, inconsistent with Big Bang message

**Weyl Curvature Hypothesis:**
- Nature seems to follow this hypothesis for allowed spacetime singularities
- Final singularities of collapse contain more degrees of freedom than initial ones (Fig. 30.17)
- Degrees of freedom absorbed in black holes not regained due to Weyl curvature hypothesis

**Hawking's 'Box' Thought Experiment:**
- Vast box of matter with no information or material exchange
- Two local entropy maxima: black hole and thermal radiation (Fig. 30.18)
- Phase space reasoning for Hawking radiation's apparent loss of degrees of freedom
- Balance between time-asymmetrical 'loss of information' in black holes and R process

**R Process:**
- Non-deterministic nature allows multiple outputs for the same input (Fig. 30.1)
- Effective spreading of phase space volume due to R process (Fig. 30.19)
- Balancing overall feature with black hole's asymmetry in spacetime singularity structure.

---

#### Quantum State Reduction and Black Hole Formation: Balancing Loss and Gain in Phase Space

**Black Holes and Phase-Space Volume Preservation**

**Violations of Liouville's Theorem**:
- Both black hole formation and R process violate Liouville's theorem, which preserves phase-space volume in dynamical evolution
- These effects exceed the scope of classical dynamics, requiring consideration of quantum and classical effects together

**Quantum vs. Classical Descriptions**:
- For a purely quantum system:
  - Correct description is in terms of Hilbert space
  - Destruction of information (unitarity) in black-hole evaporation presents a problem
- Proposed viewpoint: Neither classical nor quantum description is entirely appropriate

**Phase-Space Description of Hawking's Box**:
- Regions A, B, C correspond to (a), (b), (c) in Fig. 30.18
- Region B has a black hole, but region C does not
- Presence of black hole results in confluence of flow lines (reduction of phase-space volume) due to information destruction at the singularity
- Compensating creation of flow lines (increase in phase-space volume) from R process's time asymmetry

**Proposed Balance Mechanism**:
- Ultimate phase-space volume preservation achieved through balance between these two Liouville-theorem violating processes
- Author has not been able to carry this argument to completion, but plans to investigate further

**Alternative Line of Reasoning**:
- Remainder of chapter discusses a different approach to obtaining an estimate of quantum state reduction rate

---

### 30.10: Schrödinger’s lump

**Schrodinger's Lump (30.10)**

**Background:**
- Discussing Schrodinger's cat experiment with a lump of material instead of an actual cat
- Two possible locations: original and displaced

**Conventional Quantum Mechanics**
- Each location represents stationary state
- Energy eigenvalues are equal (no change in resting place)
- Superposition, represented as |Ψ>, is also a stationary state

**Gravitational Field Consideration**
- Bringing in lessons from General Relativity
- Spacetime geometry not flat on Earth's surface
- Need a vector field on spacetime to express '∂/∂t' concept (timelike Killing vector κ)
- Stationary background spacetime characterized by the existence of κ
- Superposition of two stationary states remains stationary in presence of gravitational field.

**Lump's Own Gravitational Field Consideration:**
- Conventional point of view: correct quantum gravity theory can accommodate lumps with accurately described classical gravitational fields, even if not precisely.

---

#### Clash Between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity: Time Measurement Near Gravitating Bodies in a Superposition State

**Understanding Quantum States and Gravitational Fields**

**Exploring Limits of Compatibility:**
- Investigating two presumptions: quantum states accurately describe matter, Einsteinian gravitational fields exist
- Example: lump on horizontal platform in two locations with distinct gravitational fields
  * Each location state is stationary in its respective spacetime
  * Associated Killing vectors:  κ   χ  and  κ   φ
  * Schrodinger equations satisfied with eigenvalue E

**Problem Arises:**
- Previous situation ignored gravitational fields, allowing writing down Schrödinger equation for superposition states
- Now encounter issue as two Killing vectors are different:  κ   χ  and  κ   φ
- Need invariant notion of ‘∂/∂t’ applicable to superposed spacetimes

**Fundamental Difficulty:**
- Clash between foundational principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity

**Properties of a Vector Field κ:**
- Invariant notion of time needed for superposed spacetimes
- Norm may differ from unity near gravitating body but normalized at large distances.

**Effects on Measurement of Time:**
- Killing vector provides conservation law, affecting measure of time in the presence of a gravitational field.

---

### 30.11: Fundamental conflict with Einstein’s principles

**The Clash Between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity**

**Background:**
- Two Killing vectors, κχ and κφ, are different in a profound sense
- Identifying them would violate the principle of general covariance in Einstein's theory
- Need to write down Schrödinger equation but lack unique 'κ'

**Approach:**
- Accept clash between quantum mechanics and general relativity temporarily
- Attempt identification based on coinciding notions of geodesics (free fall) in both spacetimes
- Computing error involved in this identification

**Newtonian Gravity:**
- Spacetime is a fibre bundle over Euclidean space 𝔼1, with fibres as different Euclidean 3-spaces
- Same notion of time (t) but cannot specify ∂/∂t without holding other coordinates fixed
- Issue of the 'second fundamental confusion of calculus'

**Error Estimation:**
- Identify 𝔼3 sections and compute error in difference between gravitational accelerations, Γχ and Γφ
- Integrate squared length difference over whole 𝔼3 section
- Interpret as measure of absolute uncertainty in defining '∂/∂t' operator for Schrödinger equation
- Uncertainty leads to absolute uncertainty EG in energy of superposed states.

---

#### Quantum Gravity: Energy Uncertainty and Superposition Decay

**Gravitational Self-Energy and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**

**Gravitational self-energy**:
- Energy gained in assembling mass distribution from point masses dispersed at infinity
- Difference between two mass distributions, taken positively (χ) and negatively (φ)
- Difficult to appreciate, especially due to negative mass distributions involved

**Interpretation for rigid displacement**:
- Energy cost to displace one instance of a lump from χ to φ, away from gravitational field of other
- Same energy as EG in case of rigid displacement
- Not always the same in other circumstances

**Expectation values and mass density distributions**:
- Each stationary state (χ and φ) defines an 'expectation value' for mass density distribution
- Difference between these two forms a distribution of positive and negative mass density
- Gravitational self-energy of this difference is EG

**Proposed definitions of EG**:
- Original proposal: gravitational interaction energy between mass distributions
- Alternative proposal: gravitational self-energy (better founded, but not free of controversy)

**Uncertainty principle and fundamental energy uncertainty**:
- Heisenberg's time/energy uncertainty relation applies to unstable particles or nuclei
- Average lifetime T is reciprocally related to an energy uncertainty ħ/2T
- Proposed that superposed state |Ψ> is analogous, with decay into constituent states in timescale TG = ħ/EG

**Exercises**:
- Confirm the relationship between EG and TG using Poisson's equation
- Analyze what happens if final location of displaced lump is raised or compressed.

---

### 30.12: Preferred Schrödinger–Newton states?

**Preferred Schrödinger–Newton States**

**Superposition Decay**:
- Quantum superposition of two states should decay into one or other constituent in time scale ~ħ/EG

**Limitations of Superposition Argument**:
- Any quantum state can be expressed as a linear combination of many other states (e.g., ψ = α + ψ−α)
- Choosing certain α may result in mass distributions that would require instantaneous decay

**Requiring Exact Stationarity**:
- Applying argument to individual particles requires exact stationarity for both χ and φ, but no such solutions exist for a single free particle

**Schrödinger–Newton Equation**:
- Takes into account the particle's gravitational field through a Newtonian potential function
- Provides well-behaved stationary solutions for a single particle
- Gravitational self-energy EG determines timescale of reduction

**Gravitational OR Scheme**:
- Proposes that spontaneous state reduction occurs due to gravitational phenomena
- Addresses energy conservation issue by covering it with uncertainty in EG
- May require further study and a complete dynamics for the reduction process

**Experimental Consequences**:
- Minimalist proposal has clear experimental consequences
- Potential for deciding whether such a gravitational OR scheme is respected by Nature

### 30.13: FELIX and related proposals

**Felix and Related Proposals**

**Basic Scheme**:
- Construct a "Schrödinger's cat" using a tiny mirror M, placed in quantum superposition of two slightly differing locations
- Mirror has a diameter about 10^(-3) cm, contains 10^14 to 10^16 nuclei (mass ~5 × 10^-12 kg)
- Tiny mirror is put into superposition by impact of an X-ray photon, which is itself in a superposition of two beams

**Experimental Setup**:
- Photon is produced by an X-ray laser L and directed at a beam-splitter B
- Transmitted part of the photon's wavefunction is aimed at the tiny mirror M
- Impact imparts momentum to the mirror when reflected, putting it into quantum superposition
- Mirror is suspended and returns to original location in 1/10 to 1 second
- Two parts of the photon's wavefunction must be coherently maintained until process is reversed

**Challenges**:
- Keeping an X-ray photon coherent for 1/10 to 1 second is difficult due to X-ray energies needed
- One suggestion is to perform experiment in space where photon coherence is maintained by reflection between large mirrors on two space platforms
- Successful execution would require keeping phase coherence at very low levels, repeating experiments with different mirror sizes and materials

**Gravitational OR Scheme**:
- According to gravitational OR, the mirror's state should spontaneously reduce in 1/10 to 1 second
- Photon's state is entangled with that of the mirror, so when mirror reduces, photon also reduces
- Detector responds at 50% probability if OR applies, vs. no response if phase coherence is not lost according to conventional quantum mechanics

#### Gravitational Quantum Superposition Experiment Proposal for Ground-based Alternative

**Alternative Ground-Based Experiment for Testing Gravitational OR**

**Proposed Alternative**: Instead of using a single high-energy X-ray photon to produce tiny mirror movement, use a low-energy visible light or infrared photon reflected backward and forward around 10^6 times.

**Benefits**: Easier implementation than FELIX proposal, potentially achievable within a few years. Even if not definitive for testing gravitational OR, it could still represent an advance over current quantum mechanical records by a factor of 10^12.

**Challenges**: Main issue is maintaining quantum coherence for the superposition of two tiny mirror locations. If successful at this stage, further improvements may be forthcoming to test novel predictions of gravitational OR.

**Implications**:
- Experiment may either confirm or contradict the proposed scheme, leading to abandonment or modification of it.
- If results support gravitational OR, quantum state reduction could potentially be considered an objective gravitational effect.

**Perspectives**:
- Some physicists may prefer to maintain strict unitarity and argue that part of the state is inaccessible or lost in "quantum fluctuations in the metric field."
- The author believes fundamental change is necessary in quantum theory, as it currently lacks a credible ontology.
- Despite expectations of conventional quantum mechanics holding unscathed by some physicists, the author anticipates new and intriguing issues to be raised and answered during the 21st century.

### 30.14: Origin of fluctuations in the early universe

**Origin of Fluctuations in the Early Universe**

**Spatial isotropy and homogeneity**:
- The universe appears to have started out with extraordinary spatial isotropy and homogeneity
- This is reflected in the standard FLRW cosmological models (§27.11)

**Preservation of symmetry in classical physics**:
- The high symmetry must have remained for all time, as the dynamics of Einstein's general relativity and other classical laws will preserve such symmetry precisely

**Quantum physics and deviations from exact symmetry**:
- Quantum physics might allow deviations from this exact symmetry to arise
- The notion of "quantum fluctuations" is invoked to provide seeds for irregularities in mass distribution
- Quantum fluctuations result from Heisenberg uncertainty relations, which limit the precision with which two non-commuting measurements can be carried out

**Quantum description of spacetime**:
- In standard quantum mechanics, all variables defining a spacetime state cannot be determined together
- The quantum description of spacetime should be well-defined but cannot resemble a classical (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold due to Heisenberg uncertainty
- Wheeler's "foam" picture suggests the state would consist of a superposition of different geometries, most of which deviate wildly from flatness

**Reconciling symmetry with irregularities**:
- The entire initial state possesses exact FLRW cosmological symmetry, and the U-evolution must maintain this symmetry
- Irregularities cannot arise entirely within the U-evolution of standard quantum mechanics
- An R-process is needed to resolve the vast superposition of geometries into a single or lesser superposition that resembles a single geometry

**Attitudes towards R-process**:
- This takes us back to the issues addressed in Chapter 29, where different attitudes to the "reality" of R were discussed
- We should bear in mind that we are concerned with the very early universe, where the temperature would have been approximately 10^32 K.

#### Quantum Fluctuations and Objective State Reduction in Cosmology

**Copenhagen Perspective vs Many-Worlds View**

**Standard Copenhagen perspective**:
- No experimenters around to perform measurements, so this perspective cannot be applied

**Many-Worlds View**:
- There is no actual R state of the universe, and it would remain FLRW-symmetric until the present day
- Conscious observers attempt to make sense of the world, leading to resolution into alternative spacetime geometries
- Superposition of conscious observers, each perceiving a single 'world'

**FAPP (Feynman, Aharonov, and Casher) View**:
- Presence of environmental decoherence is regarded as the signal
- Quantum superposition of different geometries can be treated as a probability mixture

**Comparison to Ordinary Quantum Mechanics Example**
- Spherically symmetric state broken by axis along which parts A and B emerged from original state
- Preservation of spherical symmetry achieved through linear superposition of all possible situations
- State entangled with material in bubble chamber, forming a superposition of pairs of tracks

**Implications for Early Universe**
- Need for some theory of objective state reduction (OR) to replace symmetrical quantum superposition with probability mixture
- Theoreticians tend to adopt FAPP interpretation, illogically treating horizon as a 'cut-off'
- Observable data from early universe experiments must be confronted by comprehensive OR proposal

**Final Comment on Causality Violations**:
- Symmetrical state in nuclear fission example was highly entangled
- Apparent causality violation can occur without inflation, if initial fluctuations come about via OR scheme

---

#### Exploration of Quantum Mechanics and its Implications in Physics

**Fundamental Importance of Improved Quantum Mechanics with Ontological Coherence**
- The importance of having an ontologically coherent quantum mechanics cannot be overstated
- Addresses foundational issues such as the role of symmetry in quantum mechanics, time reversal of experiments, and quantum measurements

**Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics**
- Maintaining symmetry follows from deterministic uniqueness of U-evolution and a weak assumption about U-evolution
- Affects various areas including biology where clear distinction between quantum system and classical measuring device cannot be made

**Experiments and Probabilities**
- Squared-modulus rule correctly calculates probabilities for forward time situation, but not backward time situation
- Uncertainty regarding entanglement and its potential impact on time reversal of squared-modulus rule

**Time Reversal of Experiments**
- Aharonov and Vaidman's argument questioning the validity of time reversal of certain quantum measurements
- Potential explanation: Time reversal of entanglements might be responsible for incorrect results from squared-modulus rule

**Unitary Evolution and Super-Scattering Operator**
- Hawking's generalization of unitary evolution through a 'super-scattering' operator
- Main disagreement between Penrose and Hawking on temporal asymmetry in quantum mechanics

**Weyl Curvature Hypothesis and Quantum Geometry**
- Refers to classical geometry at the point where 'quantum geometry' crystallizes into a classical spacetime
- Hawking's research on this topic, along with disagreements and possible solutions involving generalized Hilbert spaces.

#### Quantum Gravity Theory and Its Relation to Consciousness

**Gravitational OR and Quantum Theory**

**Coherent States**:
- Coherent states, as referred to in §26.6, might be coherent

**Indices on κ, χ, φ, g**:
- Indices on **κ**, **χ**, and **φ**, as well as **g**, are just labels and not "tensor indices" in the sense of §12.8

**Superposition of Gravitational Fields**:
- Superposition of two gravitational fields involves the superposition of different vacua, even in the Galilean limit
- This is due to the need for a phase factor involving a cubic term in time **t** when passing from a freely falling frame to one fixed in a gravitational field
- Respecting the principle of equivalence fully requires that this superposition be unstable

**Expectation Values**:
- "Expectation value" refers to the average outcome of a measurement if an infinite number of identical measurements were made (see §22.5 and Moroz et al., 1998)

**Gravitational OR Proposals**:
- There are many proposals in this field, including those involving gravitation crucially (Diósi, Percival, Kibble, Pearle, Squires, Penrose)
- Some recent ideas suggest a more rigorous justification for this type of proposal

**Relativity and Symmetry**:
- The action of an abstract symmetry on a spacetime geometry may yield the same geometry (due to general covariance)
- Attitudes towards this issue do not affect the main point

**Participatory Universe**:
- Wheeler's "participatory universe" concept would attribute conscious observers as determining early universe selection

**Cosmic Horizon and Quantum Physics**:
- The cut-off at the Hubble radius in the inflationary scheme is not directly related to the actual "horizon size" or quantum-to-classical transition
- It is a classical effect of the universe's expansion on a field subject to relativity constraints

## 31. Supersymmetry, supra-dimensionality, and strings 
###  31.1: Unexplained parameters

**Supersymmetry, Supra-dimensionality, and Strings**

**Unexplained Parameters in Modern Physics**

- Most physicists propose new ideas for 21st century physics: extra dimensions, strings or membranes (branes), supersymmetry, non-commutative geometry, discreteness at tiny levels, abandonment/reformulation of spacetime.
- Motivation comes from successes of quantum mechanics and general relativity, which challenge direct intuitions about reality.
- However, these proposals do not guarantee belief or understanding; motivation lies in deeper research into the universe's inner workings.

**Renormalization and Unexplained Parameters in Standard Model**

- Standard model successful but not free of infinities (renormalizable theory).
- Renormalization procedure evades infinite scalings for mass and charge, allowing finite answers for other quantities.
- 17 or more unexplained parameters include coupling constants, quark and lepton masses.

**Challenges with Constants of Nature**

- Fine structure constant (α) has an exact value but is now considered a running coupling constant.
- Expressing charges in absolute units (Planck units) leads to rough values for e = 1/√137 and quark charge, one-third of e.
- Absolute units were first introduced by Max Planck in 1906, with electric charge as the basic unit; later emphasized by John Wheeler using Dirac's form of Planck's constant (ħ).

**History of Absolute Units**

- First proposed by George Johnstone Stoney in 1881.
- Later referred to as 'Planck units' due to Max Planck's proposal in his 1906 paper, where he used ħ instead of electric charge for defining absolute units.

---

#### Exploring Quantum Gravity and Mass-Renormalization Mysteries

**Mass vs Charge Values**
- Problem of mass is thornier than charge
- All particles have charge values that are integral multiples of a basic charge (proton or minus down-quark)
- No full understanding of why this is the case, especially for 137.036

**Mystery of Small Mass Values:**
- Absolute mass values are incredibly tiny compared to macroscopic masses (midge)
- Electron mass: ~0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 043 g
- Proton mass: ~1836 times electron mass
- Electron neutrino mass is less than 10–5 of electron mass

**Relation to Planck Mass and Scale:**
- Natural 'Planck mass' much larger than masses of basic particles in Nature
- Tiniest scales encountered in particle physics are far smaller than Planck distance (~20 orders of magnitude)
- These mysteries could be explained by a renormalization process or finite theory, but current approaches to quantum gravity have not yielded such results.

---

### 31.2: Supersymmetry

**Supersymmetry and Supergravity**

**Background:**
- Amalgamation of Einstein's theory with supersymmetry principles results in supergravity
- Supersymmetry: a mathematical framework that pairs bosons with fermions through symmetry relationship
  * Distinct from normal symmetry groups, which only rotate sets of bosons or fermions among themselves

**Basic Idea:**
1. Bosons and fermions can be paired off through supersymmetry
2. Operators needed for this are not infinitesimal generators of an ordinary continuous group but a supergroup
3. Super-Lie algebra constructed based on extended Lie algebra laws (anticommutation as well as commutation properties)
4. Generators described as elements in Grassmann algebra, forming a respectable area of pure mathematics
5. Useful for motivating or establishing mathematical results relevant to particle physics but does not necessarily prove direct relevance

**Supersymmetry vs. Standard Model:**
1. Precise fine-tuning required by standard model not fully understood without supersymmetry
2. Supersymmetry suggested as a means for achieving this fine-tuning in grand unified theories (GUTs)
3. No observational evidence for GUTs; only theoretical advantages make it appealing to QFT builders
4. Easier to make supersymmetric QFTs provide finite answers compared to non-supersymmetric ones due to cancellation of infinities.

---

#### Exploring Superpartner Hypothesis and Grand Unification Theories

**Supersymmetry: Difficulties and Criticisms**
- Nature may have different ways to create fundamental particles, not limited to supersymmetry
- Main issue with current supersymmetry is presence of 'superpartners' for every particle, all having differing spins by ħ
  - No such partners found experimentally
  - Official explanation: superpartners are incredibly massive (thousand times the mass of proton or more) due to a yet undefined "supersymmetry-breaking mechanism"
    * Contrived hypothesis, as particles with smaller spin become more massive
    * Excludes Higgs boson and its potential superpartner if it is 0-spin
    * Difficulty explaining inflationary cosmology's scalar particle (φ) fitting into this framework

**Supersymmetry and Grand Unification Theory:**
- Some argue that grand unification requires all interaction strengths to be equal at extremely high temperatures, around 1028 K (about 10–39 seconds after the Big Bang)
- Argument is based on renormalization effects, which bring bare values of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions together in theory
  - Critics argue this is an extrapolation with no new discoveries expected between these temperatures and those accessible by current accelerators.

### 31.3: The algebra and geometry of supersymmetry

**Supergravity Theory and Supersymmetry**

**Gravitino**:
- Postulated particle in supergravity theory, a massless partner of the graviton
- Unless there is severe supersymmetry breaking, it is also massless like the graviton

**Relating Gravitino to Geometry**:
- In accordance with Einstein's teachings on spacetime curvature, the gravitino may play a corresponding (super)geometrical role
- Many supergravity theorists propose generalizing the concept of a manifold to a "supermanifold"

**Superalgebra and Manifolds**:
- The simplest algebra is obtained by adjoining an anticommuting element **ε** to the real-number system **ℝ**
- Each element in the algebra has the form **a + εb**, where **a** and **b** are real numbers commuting with **ε**
- The sum and product of two such elements follow the rules of ordinary algebra, but ignore terms involving **ε**
- The "super" part of the algebra is nilpotent, vanishing when raised to a high enough power

**Geometrical Description**:
- Regard the n-dimensional manifold M as embedded in an (n+1)-dimensional manifold M'
- Define **ε** as a 1-form on M', restricted to points of M
- The "body" quantities refer to directions within M, while the "soul" quantities refer to directions pointing away from M into M'

---

#### Exploring Geometrical Interpretation of Supersymmetry with Oddities in Superalgebra Convention for N=3.

**Superalgebra and Supersymmetry Concepts:**
- Picture clarifies ideas of supersymmetry and supermanifolds (Abhay Ashtekar, Chapter 32)
- 'Body' refers to intrinsic quantities in M
- 'Soul' refers to outward pointing quantities in M′

**Issues with Standard Approaches:**
- Oddities: anticommutation vs commutation of supersymmetry generators and forms
- Formal mathematical solution: symmetrical product instead of wedge product for consistency

**Applications in Particle Physics:**
- Simplest case N = 1 is usually adopted due to fewer superpartners per particle

**Supergroups and Internal Symmetries:**
- Transformations involving 'internal symmetries' and rotations
- Fibers of a bundle B over spacetime (Section 15.1) extended into neighboring space B′ with N greater dimensions.

**Exercises:**
1. Write down the sum and product of two such quantities when N = 3.
2. Show that the multiplicative inverse exists for an element a ≠ 0.
3. What power is taken when raising this element to a power?

---

### 31.4: Higher-dimensional spacetime

**Supergravity: Higher-Dimensional Spacetime**

**1970s Excitement about Supergravity:**
- Hoped to be renormalizable, unlike Einstein general relativity
- Original excitement came from cancellation of 1-loop divergences in theory with specific matter types

**Limitation of Supergravity:**
- Non-renormalizability reappeared at 2-loop level
- Fully renormalizable version still not obtained

**Increase in Spacetime Dimensionality:**
- Dimension increase to 11 seemed more promising
- Cannot be obtained for a fully renormalizable supergravity

**Kaluza–Klein Model:**
- Proposed by Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein in the early 20th century
- Extra dimensions considered as small, not directly perceived by larger beings
- Scale of tiny extra dimension: Planck distance (10−35 m) or slightly bigger

**Modern Higher-Dimensional Theories:**
- Some recent developments suggest larger scales for extra dimensions
  - Even up to a millimeter in diameter or not closed up at all
- Experimental tests have not found deviations from Newton's law down to half a millimeter.

**Physical Reasons for Believing in Higher-Dimensional Spacetime:**
- Kaluza–Klein model was proposed to geometrize electromagnetism, bringing it into the framework of 4-dimensional spacetime.
- An attractive and natural idea following Einstein's successful incorporation of gravitational field into curvature of spacetime.

---

#### Kaluza-Klein Theory: 5D Model Reducing to Standard Physics with Symmetry Restriction

**Kaluza-Klein Theory**

**Theory Overview:**
- Describes how unified 4D and 5D theories relate to standard relativity
- Applies vacuum equations (Ricci tensor = 0) in both theories
- In the 5D theory, symmetry required to avoid infinitely many degrees of freedom

**Freedom of Fields:**
- For a field with k components on a q-dimensional surface: infinite freedom ∞kq
- Standard relativity: k = 4, q = 3 → infinite freedom ∞4∞3
- Maxwell theory: same as standard relativity
- Combined Einstein–Maxwell theory: effective number of components per point is sum of each field separately, so 8 independently

**Challenge in Kaluza–Klein Model:**
- In a 5D theory under Ricci flatness condition (Rab = 0), the initial surface is 4D and q = 4
- This results in an enormously greater freedom ∞10∞4 compared to required value due to more functions of 4 variables than 3
- Symmetry imposed through continuous U(1) symmetry, reducing 4 back to 3 dimensions by assigning a Ricci-flat Lorentzian (pseudo)-metric to B instead of only assigning metric to M

**Killing Vector:**
- Expresses the symmetry in small dimension
- Essential for imposing continuous U(1) symmetry and reducing 5D space back to 4D spacetime

**Differences from Conventional Theory:**
- In Kaluza–Klein model, B itself is assigned a Ricci-flat Lorentzian (pseudo)-metric instead of only assigning metric to M

**Striking Fact:**
- Imposing Ricci flatness on B and U(1) symmetry provides most of the equations for Einstein–Maxwell theory in 4D space
- All that is needed is a Killing vector with constant non-zero negative norm to eliminate unwanted scalar field

**Reason for Popularity of Higher Dimensional Kaluza–Klein-Type Theories:**
- Main reasons come from string theory, which employs both supersymmetry and higher dimensions in comprehensive versions actively pursued today.

### 31.5: The original hadronic string theory

**String Theory and Hadronic Scattering**

**The Original Motivation for String Theory**
- Continuation of driving ideas in Chapters 24-26 to eliminate QFT infinities
- Historical motivation from observational curiosities in hadronic physics

**Hadronic Scattering Phenomena**
- Short-lived particles called resonances, last only for about 10^-23 seconds
- All possible activities must be considered for quantum amplitude calculation
- Three ways transformation might occur: intermediate particles (X), particle exchange (Y), and closed loops (Z)

**Duality in Hadronic Scattering**
- Each approach gives the same answer, suggesting physically same process
- Incomprehensible from standard Feynman-diagram perspective

**String Perspective for Understanding Duality**
- Nambu's conclusion based on Veneziano's formula and modeling particles as strings
- String history is a 2-dimensional surface, processes are different ways to look at the same process
- Equivalence of (a), (b), and (c) from Fig. 31.4 explained by topologically equivalent string diagrams in Fig. 31.5
- Higher-order processes involve more complicated topology with a corresponding number of loops (Fig. 31.6)

**Explanation of Regge Trajectories using String Model**
- Elastic string picture provides an explanation for straightness of Regge trajectories in Fig. 31.6

---

#### String Theory: A Unified Approach to Particle Physics

**The String Model**

**Observed Fact**:
- Hadrons exhibit remarkably straight lines (e.g., Fig. 31.6)
- No complete alternative explanation for this observation

**Improvements over Conventional Feynman Approach**:
- Addresses ultraviolet divergences by "smooth[ing] out" point particles with strings
- Closed loops in standard Feynman graphs are taken over by surfaces with higher topology (Fig. 31.5d)
- Provides better chance to represent physical total answer, rather than divergent integrals from Feynman diagrams
- Different particle varieties can be incorporated as vibrational modes of strings

**Riemann Surfaces**:
- String histories can be taken as Riemann surfaces
- Riemann surfaces have rich geometrical and analytical properties (recalled from Chapter 8)
- Control physical behavior via the use of complex structures, as in twistor theory

**Linking to Twistor Theory**:
- Twistor theory makes crucial use of complex (holomorphic) structures
- String theory also controls physical behavior with Riemann surfaces and complex curves

**Recent Developments**:
- Witten's recent work may be realizing early aspirations of linking string theory and twistor theory
- Does not represent a comprehensive new string theory, but refers to "mainstream" string theory in intervening sections.

---

### 31.6: Towards a string theory of the world

**String Theory: A Perspective**

**Background:**
- Ideas introduced in the late 1970s
- Debate among physicists regarding significance and progress
- Emotionally charged subject with strong opinions on both sides
- String theory seen as revolution in physical thought by some, others argue no progress towards observationally established facts

**Supporters' Viewpoints:**
- Michael Green: Compelling theory in a class of its own
- Edward Witten: Fell into the 20th century but part of 21st century physics

**String Theory Development:**
- Originated from experimentally observed hadronic physics
- Departed drastically from initial beginnings
- Little guidance from observational data since then

**Assessing String Theory:**
- Difficult to assess dispassionately due to aesthetic judgements and mathematical desiderata as the primary drivers for development
- Turns in theory taken without clear guidance from observational facts or local language understanding
- Tourist analogy: navigating unfamiliar city with aesthetic appeal as guide
  - Guide may have better insights than tourists but lacks prior knowledge of city or language
  - Some choices lead to sophisticated buildings, others may be misleading.

**My Viewpoint:**
- Presenting historical description of string theory developments and personal reactions
- Proposes a "tourist" analogy for understanding the route taken in theory development with aesthetic appeal as primary guide.

---

#### Mathematical Aesthetics and Theoretical Physics: Risks and Rewards

**Mathematical Aesthetics in Physics**

**Successive Choices of Turn**:
- Each choice of turn is a gamble
- Feeling that a different one held more promise than the guide's actual choice

**Physicists Demonstrating Power of Insights**:
- Great physicists have demonstrated power of special insights, often mathematical in character
- Example: Dirac's equation for the electron (Section 24.7) was an aesthetic leap into the unknown
- Subsequent confirmation through observation

**Einstein's General Relativity**:
- Partly driven by mathematical aesthetic considerations
- Beautiful mathematical structure contributes to its strength
- Initially no clear observational demand when first formulated
- Guided by physics, particularly the principle of equivalence (Section 17.4)

**String Theory**:
- Primarily mathematically driven
- Mathematical consistency crucial for physical theory to make sense
- Changes to overcome inconsistencies may depend on mathematical knowledge and aesthetic preferences
- Difficulties arise when changes are made without clear evidence, leading to potential failures and need for further changes

---

### 31.7: String motivation for extra spacetime dimensions

**String Theory: Motivation for Extra Dimensions**

**Anomaly Disappearance**:
- Early inconsistency in string theory was an anomaly that led to disastrous effects
- The anomaly disappeared when increasing the number of spacetime dimensions from 4 to 26

**Perspective on String Theory**:
- The author felt there should be a different way around this
- This was influenced by their perspective from twistor theory, which suggests spacetime has directly observed values in one time and three space dimensions

**Challenges with Original String Model**:
- The model had difficulties like tachyonic behavior (faster-than-light propagation)
- As the standard model gained success, physicists were less interested in such "far-out" suggestions

**Superstring Revolution**:
- In 1984, Michael Green and John Schwarz developed a scheme incorporating supersymmetry and reducing spacetime dimensionality to 10
- This removed the tachion problem and made string theory a quantum gravity theory rather than a strong interaction theory
- The new strings had a much smaller string tension, making them "pointlike" at the hadronic scale

**Technical Differences**:
- The original hadronic strings had a tension that increased with stretch, while new gravitational-scale superstrings have a constant tension independent of stretch

---

### 31.8: String theory as quantum gravity?

**String Theory as Quantum Gravity**

**Developments in String Theory:**
- Completely transformed perception of string theory
- Rapidly gained great popularity
- Claims made for a 'complete consistent theory of quantum gravity' (§31.8)
  * Finiteness claims not fully proved but regarded as unimportant by some proponents
- Regarded as the only game in town by prominent theoretical physicists and string theorists (Polchinski, 1999)

**Negative Reaction from Relativists:**
- Outlook rooted in deep interest in Einstein's general relativity
- Differences in central issues to be resolved for quantum–gravity union: finiteness vs. deep conceptual conflicts between principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity (§30.11, §31.10)
- Frustration with the fact that critical issues seem not recognized by string theorists

**String Theorists' Claims:**
- Quantum theory of gravity instead of general relativity or Einstein's theory
  * What do they mean by 'gravity' if not general relativity?
- Vacuum equation in 10 dimensions: Ricci tensor (Rab) = 0 with metric and other fields (antisymmetric tensor, dilaton; §31.9–§31.12)
  * String constant is very small (α′ ≈ 10–68 m2) and considered an excellent approximation for Ricci flatness in the 10-dimensional spacetime.

---

### 31.9: String dynamics

**String Dynamics and Equations**
- String theory is a theory about tiny strings running through a background spacetime
- The dynamics of the string are controlled by a Lagrangian, which is the surface area of the world sheet (history of the string) in spacetime divided by α′
- Classically, the world sheet behaves like a 'soap film' or minimal surface in the given background spacetime
- In quantum mechanics, anomaly issues arise and consistency conditions on the curvature of the 10-dimensional spacetime are needed for quantum strings
- A lowest mode of excitation of a closed string describes a massless particle of spin 2, which is now viewed favorably as a graviton in the new string theory
- The new string theory predicts gravity and has been hailed as an insightful theoretical advance by Edward Witten

**Limitations of String Theory**
- The theory is restricted to being a perturbative theory expressed in terms of power series
- Relativity practitioners view this as a serious limitation, as the considerations do not provide a theory with the same underlying principles as general relativity
- Some string theorists propose a 2-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) philosophy, but it is difficult to reconcile with the dynamical degrees of freedom in spacetime geometry
- The 4-dimensionality of our observed spacetime is often taken lightly and not seen as crucial
- The consistency conditions on the curvature of the background spacetime hold even where the string world sheet is not located, indicating that the classical system is not being quantized.

---

### 31.10: Why don’t we see the extra space dimensions?

**Why Don't We See Extra Space Dimensions?**

**The Issue**:
- In a 10-dimensional spacetime, Ricci flatness allows for an excessively large functional freedom compared to ordinary 4D field theories.
- This "explosion of functional freedom" is due to the additional spatial dimensions (6 dimensions) and the assumption that they are "exceedingly 'small'".

**Potential Solutions**:
1. **Quantization of String Theory**:
   - String theorists hope that quantization of strings may impose additional constraints, reducing functional freedom.
2. **Compactification**:
   - The expectation is that quantum-mechanical considerations will effectively "kill off" degrees of freedom related to extra spatial dimensions due to their small size.
3. **Product Manifolds**:
   - In a product manifold A × B (where A and B are (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds), the metric is the direct sum of the metrics on A and B individually.
   - If both A's and B's metrics are Ricci-flat, then the direct-sum metric on A × B is also Ricci-flat.
4. **Perturbations**:
   - Perturbations away from 𝕄 × Y (the product of a flat Minkowski spacetime with a compact, small Ricci-flat space) can be described by fields on 𝕄 × Y.
5. **Normal Modes**:
   - Normal modes are analyzed using an initial value problem, representing 𝕄 as Euclidean 1D and 3D spaces.
   - The normal modes of E3 (Euclidean 3-space) are continuous momentum states, while the modes on Y (the compact Ricci-flat space) form a discrete family.
6. **Exciting Normal Modes**:
   - Exciting one of these modes requires an enormous amount of energy except for specific zero-energy modes that will be ignored for now.

#### Extra Dimensions in String Theory are Experimentally Inaccessible at Present Cosmological Epoch

**Y-Space Energy and Extra Dimensions in String Theory**

**Reasoning for Large Expected Energy**:
- Based on minute scale of Y (~10^-35 m) and its wavelength comparable to Planck distance
- Leads to a Planck frequency ~ 10^-43 seconds
- Energy required to excite such modes: around 10^12 joules, much larger than ordinary particle interactions
- Arguments suggest these modes remain unexcited in present-day processes

**Background on Y-Space and Extra Dimensions**:
- Six of universe's dimensions settled into a roughly Planck-scale Y
- Remaining three spatial dimensions expanded to give 3D universe
- Y-spaces were undisturbed from early stages of the universe

**Analysis of Perturbation Modes on Y-Space**:
- **S1** as a circle with small radius **ρ** and coordinate **θ**
- Models of Y are Fourier modes **e**in**θ**, where n is an integer
- Ordinary Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) for 𝔼3
- Looking for eigenstates of the Laplacian operator on 𝔼3 × S1
- Replaces certain terms in Laplacian with **n2/ρ2** for each mode analysis
- Leads to a modified Klein–Gordon equation with increased mass

**Mass of Particles in Extra Dimensions**:
- Any observed particles have much smaller masses than Planck value
- New particle in extra dimensions would have mass at least of Planck order
- These particles lie beyond reach of presently feasible particle accelerators

**Miscellaneous Exercises**:
- [31.3]: Hints for understanding the given expressions
- [31.4]: Why the replacement can be made in Laplacian terms?
- [31.5]: Justification for the mode analysis replacement.

---

### 31.11: Should we accept the quantum-stability argument?

**Quantum Stability Argument in String Theory**

**Questions about Quantum-Stability Argument**:
- Is this reasoning really appropriate?
- Why should three spatial dimensions behave so differently from the remaining six?

**Moduli Problem**:
- Zero-energy modes lead to a serious difficulty referred to as the "moduli problem"
- This problem is normally ignored by string theorists
- Moduli are parameters that define the shape of Y-space, and zero-energy modes refer to varying these moduli
- Allowing variation can result in singular Y-spaces

**Limitations of Ignoring Moduli Problem**:
- Energy from local particle interactions is only a small fraction compared to energy available in the universe
- Modes of excitation spread uniformly over 𝔼 3 × Y, not limited to a local region
- Quantum particles need not be spatially localized

**Analogy with Hosepipe**:
- Hosepipe modes include vibrations along its length (𝔼 3 modes) and distortions of cross-sectional shape (Y modes)
- Amplitude of Y mode vibration decreases as pipe radius increases, approaching zero in the limit of infinite radius
- Suggests that a classical description might be more appropriate for very large quantum numbers

**Classical Limit and State Reduction**:
- The classical limit and state reduction issues cannot be fully resolved within present-day quantum theory
- Physicists should know when to use quantum vs. classical descriptions

#### Quantum vs Classical Approach for Large Angular Momentum Systems

**Angular Momentum and Classical vs Quantum Descriptions**

**Large Angular Momentum**:
- Classical description is more appropriate due to well-defined rotation axis
- Treating as quantum system with large j value results in many spin directions, usually pointing all over the place
- In practice, classical description should be used for very large angular momentum and provides a good picture of physical reality

**Distinction from Hosepipe Vibrations**:
- Small distance ρ alone is not an appropriate measure for when to use quantum or classical descriptions
- For fixed ρ, the description of local hosepipe vibrations becomes more "classical" as R increases
- This is because larger R requires involvement of more excitons and higher vibrational quantum numbers (modes of Y)

**Lack of Clear Criteria**:
- No definitive criteria for when large systems become well described classically while small ones behave according to quantum rules
- Without such a theory, it is unclear how perturbations of Y behave in an actual universe with "small" Y
- Quantum picture of very large numbers of quanta where individual quantum affects geometry of Y hardly at all and large quantum numbers may provide more insights

### 31.12: Classical instability of extra dimensions

**Classical Instability of Extra Dimensions**

**Singularity Theorem**:
- Applies to perturbations of 𝕄 × Y, where Y is a 'small' Calabi–Yau space
- Shows that any generic Ricci-flat (1 + 6)-spacetime Z evolves from Y must be singular
- Normal expectation is that this obstruction arises due to diverging curvature, but the theorem does not directly show this

**Perturbations Affecting Only Y**:
- Z starts out close to the 'time-evolution' 𝔼 1 × Y, but deviates strongly at later times
- Singularity occurs in a comparable timescale (~ 10–43 seconds) if perturbation size is of the same order as Y
- Disturbances that significantly spill over into 𝕄 part are even more dangerous to our 'ordinary' picture of spacetime

**Quantum Mechanics and Singularities**:
- Quantum mechanics cures singularities in classical theories, but singularities can persist after quantization
- String theory demands a different requirement than Ricci flatness, which may or may not evade the singularity theorem

**Mathematical Challenges**:
- The full string theory requirement is an infinite system of differential equations of unbounded differential order
- Requires an infinite number of parameters per point on the initial 9-surface, leading to excessive functional freedom

---

### 31.13: Is string QFT finite?

**String Theory: Finite QFT Questionable?**

**Background:**
- String theory's claims: reproduces Einstein's general relativity in a sensible 'classical limit' and is a consistent finite quantum field theory (QFT)
- Arguments against string theory's claims, focusing on the finite QFT aspect

**Issues with Lorentzian vs. Riemannian Metrics:**
- String world sheets have timelike worldsheets with a Lorentzian metric but mathematics is carried out using positive definite metrics (Riemann surfaces)
- Wick rotation used to obtain Lorentzian string theory from Riemann version, but justification depends on no approximations made in computations and background spacetime being flat

**Finiteness Claims:**
- No mathematical demonstration of finiteness provided for all ultraviolet and infrared divergences
- Finiteness claims only refer to ultraviolet divergences, established only at the 2-loop level
- Uncertainty regarding infrared divergence elimination

**Summation Problem:**
- Even if finite amplitudes are obtained for each fixed topology, summing them up results in a divergent intended finite theory. This divergence is not a problem for string theorists but raises questions about trusting perturbative calculations and the overall approach to quantum gravity.

---

### 31.14: The magical Calabi–Yau spaces M-Theory

**The Magical Calabi–Yau Spaces and M-theory**

**Background:**
- String theory aims to unify physics by considering the universe as a 10-dimensional space curled up into specific compact 6-manifolds (Y spaces)
- Early hopes were for unique answers from stringent requirements of supersymmetry, dimensionality, Ricci flatness, and physical requirements
- However, vast numbers of alternatives emerged
- Calabi–Yau spaces proposed as potential solutions due to their unique properties:
  - Kähler manifolds with both real Riemannian metrics and complex structures
  - Ricci-flat metrics and constant spinor fields for supersymmetry generators

**Calabi–Yau Spaces:**
- Named after Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau, who studied them as Kähler manifolds
- Essential for string programme: possess unique symmetries and constant spinor fields
- No continuous symmetries, but particle symmetries refer to rotation of constant spinor fields among themselves
- Non-uniqueness issue: tens of thousands of classes with infinitely many distinct spaces within each class
  - Moduli provide zero-energy modes of oscillation, but can lead to instabilities (Fig. 31.11)

**Types of Calabi–Yau Theories:**
- Five distinct possible overall schemes for interrelating supersymmetry's bosonic and fermionic modes: Type I, IIA, IIB, Heterotic O(32), and Heterotic E8 × E8
  - Differences lie in how right-handed and left-handed disturbances relate to each other
- Type I theories employ both open-ended strings and closed loops; others operate only with closed ones.

---

#### String Theory and Mathematics: Evidence for Interconnectedness

**String Theory Developments**

**Heterotic Strings**:
- Left- and right-moving disturbances belong to two spacetimes of different dimensionality (26 and 10)
- Seen as the geometrically appropriate picture, but left-moving disturbances behave like older 'bosonic strings' in a 26-dimensional ambient spacetime
- Theoreticians are not troubled by apparent inconsistencies in spacetime dimension, viewing it as an "energy-dependent" effect

**Proliferation of Different String Models**:
- Caused many theorists to despair of progress due to inconsistencies between models
- However, remarkable developments indicated possible deep interrelationships between these apparently very different models

**The Second Superstring Revolution**:
- In 1995, Edward Witten outlined a program for developing string theory, transforming how the subject is viewed
- Revealed that different string theories have deep relations to one another through "symmetry operations" (strong–weak duality or mirror symmetry)
- Different Calabi–Yau spaces turn out to be dual to one another in various ways
- Relationships between different models are not all proven as mathematical results, but conjectures with circumstantial evidence have stimulated pure-mathematical research

**Example: Counting Rational Curves in Calabi–Yau Spaces**:
- Norwegian mathematicians had developed methods to count rational curves in a specific set of complex 3-manifolds (Calabi–Yau spaces)
- Using mirror symmetry, physicists obtained the same numbers as the mathematicians, indicating the relationship between the two approaches
- A computer code error was later discovered, confirming the agreement between the two methods

---

#### Unification of String Theories: M-theory & Beyond

**M-Theory and Membranes**

**Overview**:
- M-theory aims to supersede string theories and incorporate various related ideas
- Encompasses strings, membranes (p-branes), and D-branes in the undefined M-theory
- Supports 11-dimensional supergravity theory

**Membranes**:
- Have p spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension
- Involved with ordinary strings (1-branes) as part of M-theory
- Higher-dimensional structures like D-branes can also be involved

**Relationship to String Theories**:
- M-theory is intended to encompass all previous string theories
- Dimensional mystery lies in M-theory's relation to various 10-dimensional string theories

**Higher Dimensions and F-Theory**:
- Suggestions of moving to even more dimensions (F-theory with 12 dimensions)
- Differences in functional freedom between numbers of dimensions not convincingly addressed
- Cavalier attitude towards spacetime dimensions justified as energy effects

**M-Theory and Supergravity**:
- Encompasses 11-dimensional supergravity theory, considered roughly as an 11-dimensional theory
- Fits into the picture of M-theory in some sense, but dimensional mystery remains.

### 31.15: Strings and black-hole entropy

**Black Hole Entropy and String Theory**

**Bekenstein-Hawking Formula**:
- Assigns entropy to black hole proportional to its horizon's surface area
- Previous arguments did not unambiguously equate this with Boltzmann's counting of degrees of freedom

**Strominger-Vafa Calculation**:
- In 1996, Strominger and Vafa provided a calculation using strings and membranes to support the interpretation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula as "counting degrees of freedom"
- The initial excitement was due to an overblown interpretation of a specific 5D result
- Later results apply to ordinary 4D spacetime, but still refer to the extremely special case of "extremal holes" with zero Hawking temperature and additional supersymmetric fields
- Calculations were performed in flat space rather than the curved black-hole metric

**Reissner-Nordstrøm Metric**:
- String theorists study a different type of black hole, patterned on the Reissner-Nordstrøm solution of the Einstein equation
- This is spherically symmetrical and characterized by an electric charge parameter e rather than rotation (Kerr parameter a)
- The condition for this to represent a black hole rather than a naked singularity is m >= |e|, with zero temperature requiring m = |e|

**BPS States**:
- The string calculations are concerned with BPS states, where supersymmetry, stationarity, and minimal energy determine the solution
- These may have relevance to string theory and other areas of study, but have yet to be shown relevant to the physical world

**Challenges and Limitations**:
- The specific calculations of string degrees of freedom are performed in flat space, which is puzzling for understanding black hole physics
- Respect must be paid to the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole, including its event horizon and "information" capture

---

#### String Theory and Black Hole Entropy: A Comparative Analysis

**String Theory and Black Hole Entropy**

**Overview:**
- In string theory, G (string coupling constant) affects black hole entropy calculations
- Small G limit gives Bekenstein–Hawking value for a black hole
- Scaling arguments used to show relation persists as G increases
- BPS states used to obtain precise value of A in formula
- Dilaton field value determines gs (string coupling constant)
- Arguments do not provide an actual string-theoretic derivation of S BH
- Unease among general relativists due to lack of role for horizon property and negative specific heat issue

**String Theory:**
- G depends on a parameter called the string coupling constant, gs
- In small G limit, log of degrees of freedom counts give entropy same as Bekenstein–Hawking value for black hole
- Scaling arguments show relation persists as G increases to obtain precise value of A in formula
- Dilaton field's expectation value determines gs

**BPS States:**
- Used to enumerated all contributing states instead of string configurations
- Logarithm of number gives precise value of A in extremal case
- Entropy holds for perturbations away from extremality and slight corrections
- Same holds for rotation and 4D spacetime

**Issues with Argument:**
1. Black holes have negative specific heat for small angular momentum, making it difficult to apply argument without positive specific heat assumption.
2. Unease among general relativists due to lack of role for horizon property in the string-theoretic approach and contrast with loop variable discussion in §32.6.
3. String theoretic calculations provide surprising relationships but fall short of independent justification for Bekenstein–Hawking entropy formula.
4. Loop variable approach to this problem might offer a more impressive quantum gravity-based attack on the issue.

### 31.16: The ‘holographic principle’

**The 'Holographic Principle' and ADS/CFT Conjecture**

**Perturbative Nature of String Calculations**:
- The string arguments referred to above, like all string calculations, are of a perturbative nature.

**Promotion of the Holographic Conjecture to Holographic Principle**:
- Certain ideas have been proposed with the intention of providing exact results in string theory.
- These ideas depend on various instances of the 'holographic conjecture', which has somehow got promoted to the holographic principle.

**Holographic Principle**:
- Analogous to a hologram, where a 3-dimensional image is perceived when a 2-dimensional surface is viewed.
- Most familiar form of this 'holographic principle' is the ADS/CFT (Maldacena) conjecture.

**ADS/CFT (Maldacena) Conjecture**:
- M = AdS5 × S5, where AdS5 is a 10-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and S5 is a 5-sphere.
- **ε**, the 'scri' (conformal infinity) of AdS5, is not the boundary of M but rather its conformal infinity.
- Proposes that string theory on AdS5 × S5 is equivalent to a supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory on ε.

**Challenges with Holographic Principle**:
- The functional freedom of ordinary fields on M and ε is vastly different due to the extra dimensions in M.
- Attempting to match spacetime symmetry to an internal group of Yang–Mills potentials is misconceived.
- The excessive degrees of freedom come about precisely because there is no specified symmetry on the S5 part of M, which would be respected by fields on M.

**Support for ADS/CFT Conjecture**:
- Correspondence between BPS states on the two sides and other coincidences that need explaining.
- Hope that it might provide a handle on what a string theory could be like without resorting to usual perturbative methods.
- Easier calculations on the ε side due to it being conformally flat, the universal covering space of compactified Minkowski space.
- Derivation of Bekenstein–Hawking black-hole entropy formula is a conjecture based on remarkable agreements between 'entropy calculations' done in different ways rather than an actual derivation.

---

### 31.17: The D-brane perspective

**D-brane Perspective in String Theory**

**Discomfort with Higher-Dimensional Spacetime**:
- Enormous increase in functional freedom in higher-dimensional theories (∞ P x ∞ M for a (1 + M) dimensional spacetime)
- Need to find a means of freezing out this extra freedom
- Recall the "hosepipe" analogy: what we perceive as a "spacetime point" is a fully dynamical entity, which provides us with enormous extra freedom

**Kaluza-Klein Theory**:
- Kaluza and Klein resorted to eliminating this freedom by decree, asserting the presence of a Killing vector taking us around the "hosepipe", reducing spacetime to a 4-dimensional one
- Mathematically, a respectable procedure but not seriously put forward in string theory

**D-branes**:
- D-branes are timelike structures of 1 + q dimensions (i.e., q space dimensions and 1 time dimension) that are stable solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity
- Represent a "BPS state" (boundary-preserving state), so they possess supersymmetric Yang–Mills 'charges' and have minimum energy, subject to this
- Feature in many modern string-related discussions, treated as classical objects within the full spacetime of 1 + 9 or 10 dimensions
- The D stands for "Dirichlet", by analogy with a Dirichlet boundary value problem

**New Perspective with D-branes**:
- Some theorists assert we might "live on" or even "coincide with" a D-brane, so our perceived spacetime is a 4-dimensional subspace within the higher-dimensional space
- This drastically reduces the functional freedom we need to anticipate, only being aware of degrees of freedom that directly impinge on the D-brane
- The hierarchy problem (gravitational forces much smaller than other forces) may be addressed by the existence of multiple D-branes with different geometries

---

### 31.18: The physical status of string theory?

**String Theory's Status as a Physical Theory**

**Background:**
- Enigmatic aspects to the status of string theory as a future physical theory
- Some claims are strongly asserted with apparent confidence, but need to be taken with caution
- Remarkable mathematical relationships between seemingly different 'physical situations'

**Mathematical Significance:**
- Deep dualities constantly surprising mathematicians with new predictions
- Mathematical structures, symmetries, and answers match on both sides
- Undiscovered reasons behind these relationships
- Some may be of purely mathematical interest without real connection to nature

**Witten's Role:**
- Most impressive figure in string theory research since the late 1980s
- Initiated several important developments and theories
- Inspired new work by combining ideas from twistor theory and string theory
- Remarkable mathematical insight and understanding, denies focusing on mathematics alone
- Successes come from peering into the ways of nature through QFT, supersymmetry, and string theory

**Assessment:**
- Proper assessment requires addressing Witten's contributions to string theory
- Extraordinary quality of intellectual achievements
- Open debate about the status of string theory as a physical theory.

---

#### Mathematical Coincidences in Physics and Math Theories

**Mathematical Relationships in Physics and Mathematics:**

**Witten's Work and Impressions:**
- Witten and colleagues uncovered deep mathematical relationships between string theory and Calabi–Yau spaces
- Some similarity with Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, where two different calculations yield same results
- Impressed by the findings but not convinced of their significance for scientific theories

**Voigt's Theory and Heisenberg's Remarks:**
- Woldemar Voigt constructed a theory of spectral lines using incorrect oscillator model in 1912
- Fifteen years later, Heisenberg and Jordan found correct approach using quantum mechanics, obtaining same formulae as Voigt for frequencies and intensities
- Reason behind this was purely formal and mathematical

**Supersymmetry:**
- Theory that unifies fermions with bosons to resolve inconsistencies in quantum field theory
- Introduced by physicists like Witten, Seiberg, and others
- Simplified proofs in Donaldson theory using Seiberg-Witten theory

**Notes:**
* The hierarchy problem: enormous discrepancy between strengths of interactions (electromagnetic vs. gravitational)
* Supersymmetry resolves inconsistencies but doesn't explain tiny particle masses or the puzzle of gravity
* Tendency for N to be a power of 2 in supersymmetry, not related to number 2N of elements in the supersymmetry algebra.

#### Quantum Gravity Theories and String Theory: Historical Overview

**Twistor Theory and String Theory: Connection to Gravity**

**Deser's Last Hope for Renormalizability of Supergravity:**
- Deser (1999, 2000) proposed a possible route to the renormalizability of supergravity based on ideas from string theory.
- This work is connected to the unification of quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity.

**Einstein–Maxwell Equations:**
- The equations include Einstein's field equations with Maxwell's energy–momentum tensor as source, together with free Maxwell equations on a curved spacetime background.

**Bundle Theory:**
- In conventional bundle description: the metric on a base space M could be 'lifted' back into a bundle B over it.
- However, this is not an essential aspect of the structure of a bundle.

**Twistor Theory and String Theory:**
- Ideas combining twistor theory and string theory have been developed but do not provide a unified physical viewpoint.

**Regge Poles:**
- Veneziano (1968) first conceived the model to explain Regge poles in physics.

**Supersymmetry:**
- With supersymmetry, the anomaly is removed when setting 8 – σ = 0, where σ is the number of space dimensions minus time dimensions.

**Anomalies:**
- The relevant number that anomalously appears in quantum commutators (and must be set to zero) is 24 – σ or 26 with supersymmetry.

**Hadronic Strings:**
- A hadronic string exhibits a difference from an ordinary rubber band, as the 'natural length' of a hadronic string would itself be zero.

**Quantum Gravity:**
- Some physicists argue that the sought-for quantum/gravity union must involve a change in the rules of QFT.
- The response from the QFT community tends to be less sympathetic, while relativity researchers express encouragement for this standpoint.

**Dilaton:**
- The term 'dilaton' refers to a quantum version of dilation arising from degrees of freedom available in a change of scale in the metric.

**Moduli:**
- Dine (2000) reflects on moduli in relation to string theory.

**Coherent States:**
- One might prefer to stay within a QFT framework and use a coherent state instead of a classical description, but this does not evade the issues being raised here.

**Exceptional Cases:**
- There are exceptional cases of zero-curvature Y with topology of a 'hypertorus' S1 × S1 × S1 × S1 × S1, but they are not favored by today's string theorists.

**Singularity Theorem:**
- The theorem applies when each timelike or null geodesic encounters 'generic' curvature somewhere along it (k [a R b]cd [e k f] k c k d ≠ 0).
- This condition is satisfied in any 'generic' spacetime. It also applies when the Ricci tensor satisfies an appropriate non-negative energy condition and for a compact spacelike hypersurface or point p whose future light cone C meets itself in all directions.

### 32. Einstein’s narrower path  loop variables

**Canonical Quantum Gravity**

**Background:**
- Einstein's theory of general relativity in 4-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime
- Goal: truly quantum context without supersymmetry
- Challenges: complexities with coordinates and constraints

**Approaches:**
1. Canonical quantization (Chapter 21)
   - Direct way to approach quantizing Einstein's theory
   - Difficulties: non-polynomial Hamiltonian, complicated equations
2. Ashtekar variables, loop variables, spin networks (Chapter 32)
   - Simplifying structure of equations in general relativity
   - Reduced constraints to polynomial form with the help of Amitabha Sen's ideas

**History:**
- Canonical approach followed by various researchers since Dirac in 1932
- Complicated non-polynomial nature of Hamiltonian made progress difficult until Ashtekar's advance in 1986.

---

### 32.2: The chiral input to Ashtekar’s variables

**Chiral Input to Ashtekar's Variables**

**Asymmetrical Treatment in Original 'New Variables'**:
- Striking feature: asymmetric treatment of right-handed and left-handed parts of graviton
- Recall that massless particle has two states of spin: positive and negative helicity
- Graviton, being a particle of spin 2, has respective helicity states: s = 2 and s = –2
- Ashtekar's formalism treats these two states differently, leading to left–right asymmetry

**Spin vs. Symmetries**:
- Spin value of a quantum particle relates to symmetries and field equations
- Geometric interpretation:
  - Spin-2 nature of gravity compared to spin-1 electromagnetism (light)
  - Gravitational waves involve spacetime distortion, with negative rotation sending it back to itself

**Helicity States**:
- For a massless field, plane waves can be composed of right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized parts
- Helicity values for spin s are ±σ (±2 in case of gravity)

**Tensor Descriptions**:
- Maxwell field tensor F and its dual *F
- Weyl conformal tensor C and its dual *C
- Dualization on ab indices yields the same result as dualizing cd indices

**Complex Wavefunctions**:
- In quantum theory, complex wavefunctions represent photon or graviton wavefunctions
- Positive frequency condition for wavefunctions in Minkowski space is not problematic

---

#### Quantum Gravity and Chiral Asymmetry in Spin Foam Models

**The Ashtekar Framework and Self-Dual and Anti-Self-Dual Parts**

**Self-dual and anti-self-dual parts:**
- Described by positive frequency self-dual quantities (+ F, + C) and positive frequency anti-self-dual quantities (- F, - C)
- In original Ashtekar framework, play different roles

**Attitudes towards asymmetry**:
1. Unimportant feature of useful mathematics in simplifying Hamiltonian
2. Probing left/right asymmetrical nature of the universe

**Nature's Left/Right Asymmetry:**
- Manifested in weak interactions (§25.3)
- Electromagnetism contains remnants, but indirectly seen via electroweak theory
- No reason to expect gravity to directly or indirectly possess such features unless a unifying relation with other forces is established

**The Role of Quantum Gravity Theory:**
- Aims at something more than just gravitation
- Laid the basic framework for all of physics, replacing classical spacetime as an approximation
- If 'something' fundamental has chirality (as in heterotic string theory and Ashtekar/twistor frameworks), chiral asymmetries in weak interactions are more readily comprehended.

**Question Answers:**
1. **Explanation of self-dual and anti-self-dual parts**: The original Ashtekar framework distinguishes between the roles of self-dual and anti-self-dual parts of the Weyl curvature or Maxwell tensor, despite no evident left/right asymmetry in gravitation. This could be viewed as an unimportant feature simplifying the Hamiltonian or probing a deeper left/right symmetrical nature of the universe.
2. **Zero result when contracting self-dual and anti-self-dual indices**: If two indices of a self-dual f are both contracted with any pair of indices of an anti-self-dual Weyl (or Maxwell) tensor, the result is zero.

---

### 32.3: The form of Ashtekar’s variables

**Ashtekar's Variables in General Relativity**

**Chirality and Ashtekar Variables**:
- Chirality comes from an asymmetrical choice of one of two kinds of 2-spinors in Lorentzian 4-space
- The unprimed index refers to the zig (negative-helicity) part of the electron, while the primed part is the zag (positive-helicity) part
- Spacetime formalisms that select either the unprimed or primed spinor as more fundamental incorporate a basic chirality and distinguish the two helicities at a fundamental level
- In Ashtekar's approach, canonical variables are chosen with respect to a spacelike 3-surface S
- The **canonical variables** consist of:
  - Components of the (inverse) 3-metric γ intrinsic to S
  - Components of the unprimed spin connection Γ taken on S

**The Role of Canonical Variables**:
- In the quantum theory, the **momentum variables** are replaced by iħ∂/∂xa, similar to the xa representation in §21.2
- Correspondingly, in the Γ representation, the γ fields are replaced by iħδ/δΓ
- The **connection** Γ has a part (Γ1) that refers to the intrinsic curvature of S and another part (Γ2) that refers to the extrinsic curvature

**Technical Difficulties**:
- The fibre group SL(2,ℂ) in the original Ashtekar approach is non-compact and has unwanted infinite-dimensional irreducible representations, leading to problems for constructing a quantum gravity theory
- To address this, a modified connection (Γη) = Γ1 + ηΓ2 has been used, where η is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
- The resulting quantum theories may not be equivalent to the original quantized version of Einstein's theory

---

### 32.4: Loop variables

**Loop Variables in Loop Quantum Gravity**

**General Covariance and Loop Variables**:
- Expressing general quantum state using basic states that can be described discretely within initial 3-surface S
- These basic states are expressed through linear superposition
- When carrying an unprimed spinor around a closed loop in S, there is a linear transformation of the spin space (defined by complex 2x2 matrix T)
- The trace (sum of elements on the diagonal) of this matrix is a basis-independent complex number, representing a property of the spin connection Γ within the choice of loop

**Loop Variables in General Relativity**:
- Carlo Rovelli, Lee Smolin, and Ted Jacobson developed the idea of Wilson loops, which are traces of connections along closed loops in S
- These **loop variables** for general relativity are essentially the eigenstates of these Wilson loops

**Geometric Character of Basic Quantum-Gravity States**:
- These basic states are very peculiar from the point of view of ordinary metric geometry
- They are not "smooth geometries" like classical general relativity
- The **metric** is concentrated along the loop in a kind of delta function, disappearing completely outside the loop
- This is different from the curvature being concentrated along the loop as in Regge calculus

**Test Surface Measurements**:
- Imagine a 2D test surface T that intersects various loops
- Each intersection point contributes an area value of 8πGηħ√j (where j is the loop's "spin" value)
- These area contributions are added up to describe the loop-variable description of an approximately classical spacetime

**Comparison with String Theory**:
- In string theory, calculations are almost always performed in a flat Minkowski space background, focusing on weak fields
- The loop-variable approach is fundamentally non-perturbative and deals with **delta functions in the area measure along the loops**
- This topological description makes no difference in "close" loops, focusing only on linking/knotting relations and discrete spin values

---

### 32.5: The mathematics of knots and links

**Knots and Links: Mathematics of Loop Variables in Quantum Gravity**

**Overview:**
- The loop-variable picture of quantum gravity leads to studying knots and links, a branch of mathematics focusing on untangling strings.
- Criteria exist for determining if a closed loop is knotted or unknotted.
- Recent years have seen the development of more refined procedures inspired by physics ideas.

**Diagrammatic Algebra:**
- Knots and links can be understood as a generalization of diagrammatic tensor algebra.
- Index lines make a difference when crossing other lines.
- The Kauffmann algebra provides elegant generalizations of combinatorial schemes for spin-network theory.

**Quantum Groups and Topological Quantum Field Theory:**
- Various mathematical structures arise from this diagrammatic algebra, sometimes called q-deformed or quantum groups.
- There's no clear relation between these 'quantum groups' and quantum theory.
- Another possible connection is topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), where field equations disappear but information exists in global structure and glitches that can act as sources for the vanishing field.

**Loop Variables vs Topological QFT:**
- Loop variables provide a system somewhat resembling TQFT, but with non-vanishing field equations.
- It's unclear if TQFTs will play significant roles in physical models due to the absence of non-trivial field equations.

**Potential Application:**
- There is an possibility that ideas from topological QFT could be applied to twistor theory, which might lead to interesting results. However, progress in this area has been limited so far.

---

### 32.6: Spin networks

**Spin Networks**

**Introduction:**
- Loop states don't provide suitable orthonormal basis for 3-geometry
- Need to pass to a generalization with intersecting loops
- Solution lies in certain structures close to spin networks studied in the 1950s

**Spin Networks:**
- Describes physics using discrete combinatorial quantities based on total spin
- Total spin: scalar quantity measuring whole amount of spin, not component
- Magnitude of total spin is the same as area expression
- Natural numbers for allowed values of n (even for bosons, odd for fermions)
- Intimately related to directional aspects of space

**Pure Probabilities:**
- Idea was to build up discrete combinatorial structure leading to physical space
- Particles/subsystems: n-units representing total spin 
- Simple example: two EPR-Bohm 1-unit pairs (A,B), (C,D)
  - Probabilities of forming 0 or 2 units when combining units not independent
- Original idea: any probability comes out as a rational number

**Spin Network:**
- Initially produced from initial 0-units without bias towards direction
- Subsequently, pairs of units brought together to form single units and record spin values
- Individual units allowed to split into pairs of units

**Visualization:**
- Can be visualized as happening within some spacetime
- No actual background spacetime presupposed in original theory
- Build up all required spatial notions from the network of spins and probabilities.

#### Quantum Combinatorics of Spin Networks and Loop Variable Approach to Spacetime Quantization.

**Spin Networks in Quantum Gravity**

**Background:**
- Spin networks: combinatorial system for calculating probabilities, no presupposed background spacetime manifold
- Originally developed to provide notions of geometry (Euclidean 3-geometry) from quantum probabilities

**Components:**
1. **Spin lines and vertices**: three lines meet at each vertex, uniquely specifying the connection
2. **Combinatorial procedure for calculating probabilities** using rules from standard quantum mechanics of spin
3. **Distinguishing quantum probability vs. probability through ignorance** by repeating transfers of a 1-unit and selecting situations with same probabilities
4. **Geometry theorem**: angle-geometry defined by quantum probabilities is the geometry of angles in Euclidean space
5. **Differences between original spin networks and loop variable approach:** different motivations, no place for gravity in original ones; dimensionally different measures (spin vs. area)

**Spin Networks in Loop Variable Quantum Gravity**
1. **Nodes with four or more lines coming together**: ambiguities require an additional specification (intertwining operator)
2. **Intertwining information encoded in 'X'-type vertex being a linear combination of 'H'-type 3-edge vertex pairs**
3. **Networks embedded in a structureless 3-surface:** topological linking and knotting properties significant for encoding additional information (harder to express than individual nodes)
4. **Static description vs. dynamical evolution:** solving constraint equations within the surface S, but difficulty in accommodating Einstein's theory fully (Hamiltonian constraint)
5. **Impressive results achieved despite unresolved dynamic issues**

**Significant Developments:**
- Thomas Thiemann's work on addressing the Hamiltonian evolution problem
- Use of loop variable formalism to arrive at impressive results in other areas.

#### Quantum Gravity: Barbero-Immirzi Parameter Controversy and Real Value Implications

**Black Hole Entropy and Spin-Network Ideas**

**Advantages of spin-network approach over string theory:**
- Provides a more direct and realistic-looking method for addressing black hole entropy than string theory (Section 31.15)
- Uses Schwarzschild or Kerr vacuum solutions of the Einstein 4-dimensional theory to describe black hole geometry
- Counting gravitational quantum states can be explicitly carried out using spin networks with appropriate approximations

**Comparison with Bekenstein–Hawking formula:**
- When a black hole becomes reasonably large, the answer for entropy agrees with the Bekenstein–Hawking formula SBH = A (where k = c = G = h = 1)
- To obtain Hawking's precise factor, one needed to take the curious value η = log2/π√3 for the Barbero–Immirzi parameter

**Numerical 'coincidences':**
- Two separate infinite sequences calculated in different ways have to agree term-by-term, reflecting a deep inner consistency of quantum geometry ideas

**Barbero–Immirzi parameter:**
- Previously seen as a mathematical convenience for making progress when the 'geometrically correct' theory demanded η = ± i
- Some proponents of loop variable approach take the view that such a real value may be the 'correct' one for quantum gravity after all, though this is not universally accepted
- With any real value for η, the chiral aspect of the theory disappears and spinor transport becomes an obscure mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic parts

#### Quantum Gravity: Loop Variables, Spin Foams, and Twistor Theory

**Chapter 32: Loop Quantum Gravity and Related Theories**

**Gravitational Phenomena and Probability Issues**:
- If R is an objective gravitational phenomenon, gravity cannot be separated from probability issues of spin-network theory
- It may be necessary to fully incorporate state reduction into the formalism for a full combination of loop-variable and spin-network ideas
- This could potentially provide a lead into an appropriate gravitational OR scheme as recommended in Chapter 30

**Loop Quantum Gravity Developments**:
- Loop quantum gravity has addressed electromagnetism in this formalism
- There are less radical ways to make spin networks of loop quantum gravity more "4-dimensional"
- Spin foam theory is an ingenious higher-dimensional version of spin networks, which can be pictured as a time-evolving spin network
- This idea has been further developed and modified by several others
- There are also possible connections with twistor theory, which will be interesting to develop more fully

**Quantum State Reduction**:
- The issue of quantum state reduction is related to the structure of spacetime singularities and their asymmetry under time-reversal
- A start has been made in examining what loop-variable approach says about the effect of quantum theory on spacetime singularities
- However, no hint of the necessary time-asymmetry arising has been seen

#### Exploring Non-Commutative Geometry and Twistor Theory in Physics

**Category Theory and Non-Commutative Geometry**

**Category Theory**:
- Powerful mathematical framework, deceptively simple
- Based on "arrows" connecting "objects"
- Combinatorial appearance, similar to other ideas mentioned (e.g., twistor theory)
- Extensions include n-category theory
  - Refines notion of homology from topology
  - Relates to loops, links, spin-foams, q-deformed structures
- Potential role in superseding conventional spacetime notions

**Non-Commutative Geometry**:
- Idea developed by Alain Connes and colleagues
- Extends notion of smooth real-valued functions on a manifold (A) to non-commutative algebras
  - Cannot be reconstructed as a "manifold" in the same way as commutative algebra
- Example: Quantum mechanical angular momentum components L1, L2, L3
  - Generates a "non-commutative sphere" S2
- Aims to produce a physical theory including the standard model of particle physics
- Model uses a product of two algebras (A1 × A2)
  - Commutative algebra of functions on spacetime (A1) with positive-definite metric
  - Non-commutative algebra arising from internal symmetry groups (A2)
  - Does not directly incorporate Lorentzian ideas of special or general relativity

### 33.2: Twistors as light rays

**Twistors as Light Rays**

**Complex Number Structure in Quantum Mechanics**:
- Amplitudes in quantum mechanics are complex numbers, leading to complex Hilbert spaces
- Complex numbers have a strong interconnection with spatial geometry, particularly for spin particles and the Riemann sphere

**Riemann Sphere in Relativity Theory**:
- The field of vision of an observer can be viewed as a Riemann sphere
- This fact has significance in twistor theory

**Spin Networks and Twistor Theory**:
- Spin networks are built up from EPR pairs
- "Quantum information" representing quanglement can travel along spin-network lines
- Time is not initially specified in spin-network theory, allowing for flexibility in time direction

**Desire to Exploit Complex Numbers in Twistor Theory**:
- Twistor theory seeks to exploit the magic of complex numbers as possibly reflecting the underlying structure of nature
- This includes the holomorphic character of the positive-frequency condition in quantum field theory

**Twistor Representation of Spacetime**:
- A twistor represents a light ray in Minkowski spacetime
- Events are described by the family of light rays passing through them, reversing the normal spacetime relationship between events and light rays

---

#### Introduction to Twistor Theory for Quantum Gravity.

**The Twistor Space in Twistor Theory**

**Background:**
- The twistor space ℙ ℕ is a five-dimensional real manifold, whose points represent light rays in spacetime.
- It is non-locally related to the four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime 𝕄.
- Spacetime points are regarded as holomorphic objects in twistor space, following a complex number philosophy.

**Relationship between Spacetime and Twistor Space:**
- Not a point-to-point transformation but a non-local correspondence.
- The full richness of twistor geometry is revealed gradually through the development of its relationship with spacetime concepts.

**The Celestial Sphere:**
- A Riemann sphere (complex 1-dimensional space) representing an observer's total field of vision or celestial sphere.
- Spacetime points are thought of as holomorphic objects in twistor space.

**Extending the 'Holomorphic Philosophy':**
- Assigning spin and energy to light rays leads to a six-dimensional space ℙ 𝕋, which can be interpreted as a complex space.
- This space is divided into two complex manifold pieces representing massless particles of positive and negative helicity.

**Differences from Conventional Quantum Theory:**
- In conventional quantum theory, the focus is on quantizing the metric tensor gab in spacetime, leading to uncertainties about null cones and causality.
- Twistor theory suggests that appropriate 'quantization' procedures should be applied within twistor space rather than within spacetime.
- In this approach, events become fuzzy while light rays remain intact.

**Complex Number Magic in Twistor Theory:**
- Classical feature of spacetime geometry: the celestial sphere can be regarded as a Riemann sphere, hinting at unifying spacetime structure with quantum mechanics.
- The full complex magic of twistor theory is specific to the 4-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime geometry of ordinary relativity.

#### Discussing Quantum Uncertainties and the Conformal Group in Relativistic Spin-Network Theory

**Perspective on Quantized Spacetime**
- Common viewpoint: spacetime with 'fuzzy' metric leading to uncertainties in light cone and spatial displacement (Fig. 33.7a)
- Twistorial perspective: retain existence of twistor space, but condition of intersection becomes subject to quantum uncertainties (Fig. 33.7b)

**Missing Concepts in Original Spin-Network Theory**
- No reference to spatial displacement or distances
- Angles arise as a limit of pure spin-network theory
- Role for linear momentum needed to incorporate translational displacements and actual distances (§18.2)

**Contemplation on Poincaré Group and Conformal Group**
- Late 1950s and early 1960s: actively thinking about these concepts, but worried about the unpleasant implications of the non-semi-simple nature of the Poincaré group (see §13.7)
- Extension to conformal group proposed as a potential solution for a more satisfactory structure in twistor theory (Fig. 33.7c)
  - Symmetry group of space ℙ ℕ of idealized light rays
  - Non-reflective part is also the symmetry group of each of the spaces ℙ 𝕋 + and ℙ 𝕋 −, describing massless particles with helicity and energy.

**Why Five Degrees of Freedom for Light Rays?**
[33.1]
- Question left unanswered in the text.

---

### 33.3: Conformal group

**Conformal Group and Compactified Minkowski Space**

**Background:**
- The conformal group is important in physics due to its role in massless fields (e.g., Maxwell field)
- Acts on a slightly extended version of Minkowski space called compactified Minkowski space 𝕄 #
- Obtained by adding an 'infinite element' – a complete light cone at infinity
- Resulting space has greater symmetry (conformal group) than ordinary Minkowski space

**Compactified Minkowski Space (𝕄 #)**
- 4-dimensional real compact manifold with Lorentzian conformal metric
- Obtained from Minkowski space by identifying past and future null infinities J − and J +
- Points on J − are considered the same as antipodal points on J +
- Light cone of a point a– on J − focuses back to a + on J +, identified
- All three points representing spatial and timelike infinities i–, i0, i+ also identified as i

**Symmetry Group (Conformal Group)**
- Has a 15-dimensional symmetry group – the conformal group
- Greater symmetry than Minkowski space's Poincaré group

**Description of Compactified Space (𝕄 #)**
- Can be described as a 'light cone' K in a pseudo-Euclidean 6-space 𝔼2,4 with signature + + – – – –
- Section by the null 5-plane w – υ = 1 gives a clearer understanding of the space's geometry.

**Picture Depiction:**
- Depicting K in a misleading way as two distinct pieces is one of the main issues with the given picture.

---

#### Compactified Minkowski Space: Geometry of Light Cone Generators

**Paraboloid Intersection as Compactified Minkowski Space**

**Intersection of Paraboloid and Flat Minkowski Space:**
- The paraboloid is a 4-manifold, identified with the space of generators (straight lines) of the 'light cone' K in pseudo-Euclidean 𝔼 2,4.
- It can be visualized as the 'celestial sphere' for an observer at the origin of E2,4, where each generator that does not lie in the 5-plane w – υ = 0 meets the paraboloid in a unique point.

**Identifying Paraboloid with Flat Minkowski Space:**
- The family of generators in the non-visible dimension (time) is parallel to w – υ = 1 and does not intersect the paraboloid, providing the points of J.
- The metric ds² on the paraboloid is identical to that of ordinary flat Minkowski 4-space.

**Properties of Paraboloid Intersection:**
- It has a conformal Lorentzian metric which is locally provided by any local cross-section of K.
- The pseudo-orthogonal group O(2,4) preserves the paraboloid's conformal structure and sends it back to itself.
- There are exactly two elements in O(2,4) that act as the identity on the paraboloid: the identity element and its negative.

**Topology of Paraboloid Intersection:**
- The topology of 𝕄 # is S1 × S3 (a sphere with a three-dimensional cross-section).

**Comparison to Odd Number of Spacetime Dimensions:**
- In an odd number of spacetime dimensions, there would be a difference due to the presence of imaginary spatial dimensions.

**Conformal Metric and Points in J:**
- The conformal metric provided by any local cross-section is the same as that of any other, as points in J agree with the definition given above (see §18.4 and Fig. 18.9 for hints).

**Proof of Result:**
- The result follows from the fact that the conformal transformations preserve the conformal structure of the paraboloid, as shown in Exercise [33.5].

### 33.4: Twistors as higher-dimensional spinors

**Twistors as Higher-Dimensional Spinors**

**Description of Twistors**:
- A reduced spinor (or half spinor) for O(2, 4) in Minkowski space
- Defined as a 4-dimensional entity in "twistor space"
- Lack a clear geometrical or physical picture without further explanation

**Twistors in Odd Spacetime Dimensions**:
- Twistor theory should exist for any even number of spacetime dimensions
- In odd spacetime dimensions, the entire 2n -dimensional spin space must be used instead of reduced spinors
- Misses key physical properties like chirality that are present in 4 dimensions

**Advantages and Disadvantages of Twistors**:
- Refer to global spacetime transformations (conformal group) rather than local quantities
- Difficult to handle compared to vectors, tensors, or spinors due to their global nature
- Aim is to obtain a formalism that can replace the spacetime manifold
- Disadvantage: Difficult to apply to general curved spacetimes

**Motivation for Twistor Theory**:
- Seeks hidden harmonies between relativity and quantum mechanics
- Exploits the "magic of complex numbers"
- Focuses on Lorentzian 4-dimensional space due to its conformal and complex manifold properties
- Different from other dimensions in terms of twistor space being a complex manifold

**Condition for an Infinitesimal O(2, 4) Matrix**:
- The explicit condition on a 6 × 6 matrix representing an infinitesimal element of O(2, 4) is not mentioned in the provided text.

---

### 33.5: Basic twistor geometry and coordinates

**Twistor Geometry and Coordinates**

**Minkowskian 4-space**:
- Physical interpretation of a general twistor in ordinary Minkowskian 4-space (𝕄) using standard Minkowski coordinates: t, x, y, z
- The full twistor space 𝕋 is a 4-dimensional complex vector space
- Standard complex coordinates for a twistor Z are Z0, Z1, Z2, Z3
- Twistor Z is incident with spacetime point R if the key matrix relation holds:

**Twistor Norm**:
- Each twistor Z has a complex conjugate 𝗺 that is a dual twistor
- The Hermitian scalar product of a twistor and its dual can be used to obtain the (squared) twistor norm:
  - **α Z α = 0**: Twistor is null (incident with a point in real Minkowski space 𝕄)
- **Z0:Z1:Z2:Z3** provide homogeneous coordinates for the projective twistor space ℙ 𝕋
- The null projective twistors constitute the space ℙ ℕ, which is the subspace of the null twistors in the complex vector space 𝕋

**Relation between ℙ ℕ and 𝕄**:
- Two points P, R incident with the same non-zero twistor Z must be null-separated from each other
- Null twistors represent light rays (null straight lines) in 𝕄
- A light ray can have multiple representations as λZα, where λ is a non-zero complex number
- The locus of events incident with a null projective twistor is a light ray or generator of the J line at infinity

**Representation of Events in Twistor Space**:
- Points (events) in 𝕄 are represented by projective lines in the null projective space ℙ ℕ, which is a Riemann sphere

---

#### Geometry in Minkowski space represented through twistor space and light rays.

**Projective Geometry in Minkowski Space: Twistor Space Perspective**

**Representation of Points and Lines**
- In projective geometry (ℙℕ), a point is represented by a line intersecting I, the exceptional line.
- Two spacetime points are null separated if their corresponding projective lines in ℙℕ intersect.

**Interpretation of Minkowski Space**
- Complex structures represent the geometry of Minkowski space in terms of ℙℕ, taking light rays as more primitive than spacetime points.

**Basic Loci and Twistor Correspondence**
1. Fix a point (projective null twistor) Z in ℙ 𝕄:
   - Points incident with Z constitute a light ray.
2. Fix a point R in 𝕄 #:
   - Points incident with R form a complex projective line, which is a Riemann sphere.
3. Null-separated points P and R along the light ray Z have corresponding intersecting Riemann spheres P and R, with vertex I representing infinity.
4. The vertex I of the light cone at infinity specifies spacelike/timelike infinity.
5. Any other point Q of J is represented by a projective line Q meeting I.

**Mathematical Equivalence**
- Show that the equation given by αZα = 0, with Z2 and Z3 not both vanishing, corresponds to an event in Minkowski space.
- Conversely, demonstrate that such an event exists for any event represented by this equation.

---

### 33.6: Geometry of twistors as spinning massless particles

**Twistor Theory: Geometry of Massless Particles as Spinning Points in Projective Space**

**Background:**
- Twistor theory is based on complex number magic and projective space geometry to describe massless particles with spin.
- The fundamental idea is that adding one more real dimension transforms ℙℕ into a complex manifold, ℙ 𝕋.

**Interpreting Extra Dimensions:**
- Photons have more structure than just light rays in Minkowski space: energy and spin (helicity).
- Twistors represent these massless particles with nonzero spin as points in ℙ 𝕋 + or ℙ 𝕋 −, depending on the helicity.

**The Role of Spinors:**
- The first two components Z0 and Z1 of a twistor correspond to a 2-spinor ω and its dual spinor π.
- These spinor parts are associated with momentum and angular momentum respectively.
- Under displacement, they undergo transformations that maintain the incidence relation between twistors and spacetime points.

**Helicity:**
- Scalar quantity related to helicity: half of twistor norm.
- Origin-independent for massless particles unlike angular momentum.

**Geometrical Picture of a Non-Null Twistor:**
- Represents a classical spinning massless particle in complexified Minkowski space.
- Associated with an α-plane (self-dual complex 2-plane) and its dual β-plane.
- Complex conjugation interchanges points with planes, enabling real spacetime representation of non-null projective twistors.

#### Geometric Visualization of Spinning Massless Particles Using Twistors

**Complex Spacetime Description of Twistors and Dual Twistors**
- For any non-zero twistor `Zα`, there exists a complex plane called an **a-plane**, which is everywhere self-dual.
- For any non-zero dual twistor `Wα`, the points in `ℂ𝕄#` incident with it form a 2-dimensional anti-self-dual plane, called a **β-plane**.
- Only for null twistors or null dual twistors are there real points on these loci. These correspond to a light ray.

**Realization of Non-Null Twistor Zα**
- Passing to the complex conjugate `α` defines a complex projective plane in `ℙ𝕋`.
- The intersection with `ℙℕ` is a 3-dimensional real locus, defining a **Robinson congruence**: a 3-parameter family of light rays.
- In ordinary Euclidean 3-space, this represents a system of oriented circles and one straight line filling the space. Each particle moves in the direction of the tangent to the circle it lies on.
- As time progresses, the entire configuration propagates with the speed of light in the (negative) direction of the straight line, representing the motion and angular momentum of a spinning massless particle.

**Twistor Norm and Incidence Relation**
- The relation of incidence between a twistor and a spacetime point is preserved under the transformation.
- The twistor norm is also preserved.

**Phase Freedom and Particle Energy Encoding**
- There is **phase freedom**, allowing for different particles with the same helicity `s>0` to have different energies.
- The particle's energy is encoded in the location of the point in `ℙ𝕋+`.

**Exercises**:
- Show that the incidence relation and twistor norm are preserved under the transformation.
- Explain why there is phase freedom and why the particle energy is encoded in the location of the point in `ℙ𝕋+`.

### 33.7: Twistor quantum theory

**Twistor Quantum Theory**

**Basics of Twistor Theory**:
- Outlines basic geometry of flat space twistor theory
- Explores how to unify spacetime structure with quantum-mechanical principles
- Regards all spacetime notions as subsidiary to those in twistor space
- Twistor variables are mixtures of position and momentum, requiring new quantization rules

**Quantization Rules**:
- **Twistor variables** (Zα) and **(α)** do not commute
- Cauchy–Riemann equations assert that twistor wavefunctions are **holomorphic** functions of Zα
- Quantum role of complex-conjugate variables (α): appear as differentiation, preserving holomorphicity at quantum level

**Helicity and Homogeneity**:
- **Helicity operator Y** is called the Euler homogeneity operator
- Eigenfunctions of Y are homogeneous, with degree of homogeneity equal to eigenvalue
- A massless particle's twistor wavefunction must be both **holomorphic** and **homogeneous** of appropriate degree

**Interpreting Twistor Wavefunctions**:
- For linear (non-graviton) wavefunctions, interpretation works smoothly
- Important subtlety: interpreting the **twistor function f(Zα)**, usually referred to as a twistor wavefunction, requires understanding Lorentz transformations and Hilbert space operators.

---

### 33.8: Twistor description of massless field

**Massless Fields: Twistor Description**

**Massless Particle Wavefunction Equation**
- Schrödinger equation translates to massless free-field equation for general spin S
- For helicity S = n, there are quantities ψ AB…D and ψ A′B′…D′
  - Symmetrical in all indices
  - Positive frequency, satisfying equations (1) and (2)
- Spin 0: wave equation □ψ = 0

**Relation to Twistor Functions**
- Explicit contour-integral expression gives solution of massless free-field equations using twistor function f(Z α)
- Requires positive frequency condition for correct results
- Integration eliminates p, leaving indexed quantity ψ… at a chosen spacetime point R
- Contour lies within line R in twistor space (Fig. 33.16)
- Twistor functions are not ordinary functions but elements of holomorphic sheaf cohomology

**Subtleties**
- Important subtlety: twistor functions should be interpreted as holomorphic sections, not just functions
- Positive/negative frequency splitting crucial for active manifestation and curved twistor spaces.

**Massless Fields Equations in Different Dimensions:**
- When n = 2 (spin 1), becomes Maxwell's free-field equations in anti-self-dual and self-dual cases, respectively
- When n = 4, becomes weak-field Einstein equation split into anti-self-dual and self-dual parts.

### 33.9: Twistor sheaf cohomology

**Sheaf Cohomology**

**Definition and Overview:**
- Sheaf cohomology: study of how functions change as we move from one patch to another in a manifold (or more generally, topological space)
- First sheaf cohomology: focusing on infinitesimal deformations of transition functions between patches
  *Think of a manifold constructed with infinitesimal shifts between patches*
  *Vector fields or functions describe these shifts*
  *Consistency conditions apply on overlaps and triple overlaps*
- Not just vector fields, any class of function (holomorphic in twistor theory) can be considered

**Components:**
1. **Transition Functions:**
   - Differ from identity by infinitesimal amount
   - Subject to consistency conditions on overlaps and triple overlaps
2. **Infinitesimal Deformations:**
   - Vector fields F ij describe shifts between patches U i and U j
   - Consistency relation: F ij + F jk = F ik holds on triple overlaps
3. **Trivial Infinitesimal Deformations:**
   - Changing coordinate systems in each patch gives trivial deformations
   - Vector field Hi – Hj in each patch is irrelevant (factored out) when calculating cohomology
4. **Rules of First Sheaf Cohomology:**
   - Collection {fij} represents a first cohomology element on Q, reduced modulo quantities hi–hj
5. **Definition and Properties:**
   - Cohomology idea applies to twistor functions provided by a collection {fij} of holomorphic functions
   *Each individual fij is defined on the overlap between U i and U j*
   *Collection {fij} reduced modulo hi–hj represents the cohomology element
6. **Limit of Finer Coverings:**
   - Holomorphic sheaf cohomology always vanishes in any Stein set
   *No need to consider specific choice of covering when referring to a cohomology element on Q*
7. **Magic of Sheaf Cohomology:**
   - Cohomology element remains unchanged regardless of the choice of Stein covering.

#### Cohomology Theory in Twistor Functions and EPR Effects.

**Twistor Functions and Contour Integrals**

**Two Patches**:
- Twistor function: f(Zα) = f12 = -f21
- **Equivalence of functions**: f(Zα) is equivalent to g(Zα) if their difference h1 - h2 is trivial
- Appropriate contour integral of f(Zα) is the same as that of g(Zα) when they are equivalent

**More Complicated Patchings**:
- Non-locality: Cohomology element defined on a region Q can be restricted to a smaller region Q'
- Cohomology element disappears completely in sufficiently small open region surrounding a point
- Reminiscent of non-local features of EPR effects and quanglement
- **Branched contour integral**: Applicable to spacetime evaluation of twistor functions with more than two patching sets

**Cohomology Elements**:
- Non-local object defined on a space Q
- Fundamentally non-local, can always be restricted down to a smaller region where it vanishes
- Similar to an entire (complex) vector bundle over Q

**Elementary Example: Impossible Object ('Tribar')**
- Drawing of a 3D object that cannot exist in ordinary Euclidean space
- Locally, there is nothing impossible about the drawing
- Impossibility is non-local and disappears if considering small enough region
- Can be expressed as a specific cohomology element

**Sheaf Cohomology**:
- Applications beyond holomorphic functions
- Sheaves refer to the type of function one is concerned with, but applies more generally
- Many other types and definitions of sheaf-cohomology elements, all mathematically equivalent
- Platonic notion that seems to have a 'life of its own' beyond any particular representation.

### 33.10: Twistors and positive/negative frequency splitting

**Twistors and Positive/Negative Frequency Splitting**

**Positive-Frequency Condition in Twistor Theory**:
- Recall how Riemann sphere S2 is split into southern and northern hemispheres S– and S+, respectively
- Divides function on equator S1 into positive- and negative-frequency parts
- Projective twistor space ℙ 𝕋 achieves this globally by analogy with Riemann sphere

**Massless Fields in Twistor Theory**:
- Represented as **first cohomology elements** on ℙ 𝕋
- Each cohomology element can be expressed as a sum of positive-frequency and negative-frequency parts
- Positive-frequency part describes massless field that extends to forward tube (region of 𝕄+)

**Analogy Between Twistor Space and Riemann Sphere**:
- Both have "hemispheres" ℙ 𝕋 + and ℙ 𝕋 –, analogous to S+ and S– on Riemann sphere
- Massless fields represented by first cohomology elements on ℙ 𝕋
- Possible link to string theory via Riemann surfaces and "pretzel twistor spaces"

**Historical Significance**:
- Positive-frequency requirement was a key motivation for original formulation of twistor theory in 1963
- Unique property arising from spacetime's four-dimensionality with Lorentzian signature
- First cohomology elements play a fundamental role in generating deformations of twistor space

**Demonstrating the Result**:
- Show that a complex position vector ra for point R in 𝕄 is represented by projective line in ℙ 𝕋 + if and only if its imaginary part is past-pointing and timelike.

### 33.11: The non-linear graviton

**Non-linear graviton**

**Twistor Functions**:
- Cohomology elements are passive, 'painted on' twistor space
- Describe spacetime fields that reside on space-time and do not influence other fields

**Active Influence**:
- Twistor function can provide active influence by having the 'paint dry' and distorting the space
- Vector field F is constructed from the passive twistor function f
- Exponentiating the infinitesimal deformation of one patch over another results in a finite deformation and curved twistor space

**Curved Twistor Space**:
- Curved twistor space T is a fiber bundle over π-space, with each fiber being a complex symplectic 2-space
- The absence of π derivatives ensures that the projection from T to π-space is consistent
- The holomorphic cross-sections of T define spacetime points, which correspond to lines in projective twistor space ℙ𝕋

**Spacetime Representation**:
- Each spacetime point corresponds to a unique holomorphic cross-section of the bundle T
- In the flat case, this is represented by the map from π to Z = (ir π, π)
- The curved twistor space T also has a 4-complex-parameter family of holomorphic cross-sections, which defines a 4-dimensional complex manifold M

---

#### Construction of Left-Handed Graviton in Complex Twistor Space.

**33.26d Shunting U1 and U2 to Get Deformed Projective Twistor Space**
- We shunt the U1 and U2 relative to each other according to vector field, resulting in the deformed projective twistor space ℙ T (Fig. 33.26e, f)
- Original 'straight lines' in U1 and U2 are broken and do not give cross-sections

**Kodaira's Theorem and Construction of M Space**
- Kodaira's theorem tells us there is a new 4-parameter family of holomorphic curves (holomorphic cross-sections) in ℙ T
- The required space M is constructed based on these cross-sections
- M can be assigned a metric g, and its Weyl curvature is anti-self-dual and Ricci-flat

**Null Cones of the g Conformal Structure**
- Points P* and Q* are null separated if and only if their corresponding lines in ℙ𝕋 intersect (Fig. 33.26g)

**Interpreting the 'Spacetime' M**
- In flat case, we can identify real spacetime points with cross-sections of 𝕋 lying in ℕ
- However, in curved case, M is a complex manifold and cannot be regarded as complexification of Lorentzian real spacetime

**Physical Interpretation of the Complex Anti-Self-Dual Ricci-Flat 4-Space (Left-Handed Graviton)**
- Represents a non-linear graviton wavefunction that is a solution to the actual non-linear Einstein vacuum equation, not just its linear approximation.
- Twistor theory unifies quantum theoretic ideas with spacetime structure in unexpected ways.

**Local vs. Global Structure of Twistor Space**
- Any sufficiently small neighborhood of a point Z in twistor space T has the same structure as any chosen point Z' in flat twistor space 𝕋 (not on infinite region I)
- This reflects the fact that cohomology element defined by a twistor function disappears when restricted to small enough regions. There are no 'field equations' stored locally in twistor space.

---

### 33.12: Twistors and general relativity

**Twistor Theory and General Relativity**

**Non-linear graviton construction**:
- Central to twistor theory development since mid-1970s
- Cried out for advances in two directions:
  - Corresponding construction for right-handed non-linear graviton
  - Combining left- and right-handed constructions for mixed polarizations
- **Non-linear graviton**: Seen as a theory where standard rules of quantum theory need to be "bent" to obtain general relativity

**Difficulties with the initial construction**:
- Only one helicity state (left-handed) was incorporated in the initial construction
- Needed a solution for "googly problem" - exponentiating -6 homogeneity twistor functions to obtain right-handed non-linear graviton

**Recent developments and tentative solution**:
- Developments provide an appropriate construction for left- and right-handed parts of the graviton
- Proposal for constructing spacetime points from purely twistorial structure, ensuring Ricci flatness

**Other advances and future directions**:
- Ward's construction led to considerable mathematical interest in integrable systems
- Advances towards a full solution may point to treating general (mixed-helicity) gauge fields within the twistor formalism.

### 33.13: Towards a twistor theory of particle physics

**Twistor Theory and Particle Physics Development**

**Key Points:**
- Twistor theory is not yet a full-blown physical theory, but progress is being made towards its development.
- Two main areas for further study are:
  * Perturbative approach to QFT using twistor diagrams (developed by Andrew Hodges and students)
    - Achieves success in avoiding infinities encountered with conventional Feynman procedures
    - Lacks an independent underlying principle to guide contour integrals
  * Twistor particle theory (developed by Zoltan Perjés, George Sparling, Lane Hughston, Paul Tod, and Florence Tsou)
        - Massless particles described by single twistor variable, f(Zα)
        - Massive particles require more variables, e.g., Xα..., Zα...
        - Expression for momentum and angular momentum involves summing individual contributions from all twistors
        - Internal symmetry group arises from transformations among these variables that do not affect total momentum and angular momentum
          - Includes groups like U(2) and SU(3), which generalize electroweak interactions and strong interactions
        - Striking relationships with standard classification of particles according to the Standard Model noted but scheme stagnated due to technical reasons
- Recent developments on the ‘googly problem’ could potentially open up the subject again, especially if applied to gauge fields.
- Twistor theory may tie in significantly with Chan–Tsou proposal for a particle physics model described briefly in §25.8.
  * Requires dual group to each (non-Abelian) particle symmetry group, in addition to the original gauge group
  * Suggests that dual form of gauge group should play a significant role beyond just the original gauge group.

**Future Progress:**
- Successful progress in this area is expected to have an important impact on the QFT programme of twistor diagram theory.

### 33.14: The future of twistor theory?

**The Future of Twistor Theory**

**Disclaimer**: The author's perspective on twistor theory does not reflect that of the larger physics community due to their extensive involvement in the field. The community of physicians knowledgeable about twistor theory is small compared to those familiar with string theory or supersymmetry. Twistor theory is not a mainstream activity of theoretical physicists today, yet it has had a significant impact on pure mathematics.

**Impact on Pure Mathematics**: Twistor theory has influenced the theory of integrable systems, representation theory, and differential geometry through its rigorous and fruitful mathematical structure. For example:
- Work by Merkulov and Schwachhöfer solved the 'holonomy problem' using methods from the non-linear graviton construction.
- Twistor theory is valuable in constructing hyperkähler manifolds, Zoll spaces, etc.

**Criticism of Twistor Theory**:
- There is no hard reason to believe twistor theory provides the route modern physics should follow based on observational data.
- The strongly chiral nature of the theory may take things too far in terms of spatial asymmetry, as there is no physical evidence for a left-right asymmetry in gravitational physics.

**Similarity with String Theory**: Twistor theory's formalism generates algebras that are identical to those of dual-twistor descriptions. This suggests that any conclusions reached using a twistor description (Zα variables) might also be obtained using a dual-twistor description (W α = α variables), with no left–right asymmetry in gravitation emerging. However, when describing weak interactions, left–right symmetry is required.

**Lack of Physical Predictions**: Twistor theory does not make unambiguous physical predictions and can be compared to the Hamiltonian formalism of classical physics, which provided a new outlook on classical physics leading to quantum mechanics. The author hopes that twistor theory might provide a foundation for future physical developments.

**Incompatibility with String Theory**: Twistor and string theories are mathematically incompatible as they stand because they operate with different numbers of spacetime dimensions. However, re-interpretations of string theory that regard extra dimensions as 'internal' rather than spacetime may provide a consistent viewpoint but are at variance with the driving force behind string theory.

**Recent Work**: Recent work by Edward Witten combines ideas from twistor theory and string theory in a 4-dimensional context, suggesting fascinating possibilities for new outlooks on Yang–Mills scattering amplitudes.

**Development of Twistor QFT**: Twistor theory requires new ideas to develop a full quantum field theory (QFT) due to the evaporation of field equations.

#### Exploring the Cosmological Implications of Twistor Theory

**Twistor Theory Predictions and Holomorphic Philosophy**

**Underlying Motivations of Twistor Theory:**
- Universe may have negative spatial curvature (K < 0)
- This expectation based on Big Bang's uniform nature resembling FLRW models, which are conformally flat and describe by a flat twistor space
- Holomorphic philosophy provides powerful driving force for theory development

**Limitations of Twistor Theory:**
- Present constructions can only accommodate Einstein vacuum equation with Λ = 0
- Future challenges: addressing real-number aspects of physics, non-holomorphic behaviour, and non-analytic phenomena

**Encouragement from Hyperfunctions:**
- Non-analytic behaviour can be represented elegantly within the context of holomorphic operations through hyperfunction theory

**Status of Holomorphic Philosophy:**
- Provided powerful driving force for twistor theory development
- Future challenges remain regarding real number aspects and non-holomorphic behavior

**Additional Notes:**
- Twistor theory says nothing about quantum state reduction yet
- Previous motivating inputs behind the theory include questions related to nonlinear graviton, emergence of probability values, real spacetime points, and accommodating non-analytic behaviour.

#### Twistor Theory: Mathematical Structure of Space-Time and Particle Interactions

**Moussouris' Approach to Quantum Theory**
- In his Oxford D.Phil thesis in 1983, John Moussouris developed a scheme based on Penrose's ideas using additional labels for lines of the network in addition to mass and spin
- Required an extra label attached to the lines
- Sections related: 33.18 (Penrose), 33.19 (Penrose & Rindler), 33.20 (Harvey, Penrose & Rindler)

**Spacetime and Angular Momentum**
- Two null directions specified at each point in spacetime: light ray direction and particle momentum direction
- These are principal null directions for self-dual or anti-self-dual part of angular momentum (See Wald, Huggett & Tod)

**Twistor Theory and Penrose's Contributions**
- Developed by Penrose and Rindler in 1986
- Owes a significant debt to Sir Michael Atiyah for early realization
- Addresses cohomology concepts (Čech cohomology) using contour integrals on projective space ℙℕ
- Allows mixed helicity states description
- Profound connection with topological QFT (See Penrose, Eastwood et al.)

**Technicalities and Subtleties**
- Fields may be hyperfunctional if original field is not analytic (Bailey et al.)
- Holomorphic fibration instead of holomorphic product space for the construction (Penrose)
- Under normal circumstances, but see Huggett & Tod, Ward & Wells, Penrose & Ward

**Ambitwistors Approach and Its Limitations**
- Reflection-symmetric approach using ambitwistors (Penrose, LeBrun et al.)
- Describes classical variables instead of wavefunctions
- Encountered mathematical awkwardness in non-linear fields description
- Some significant partial successes but technical difficulties remain

**Significance of Twistor Theory**
- Implicitly solves field equations using homogeneous twistor functions for free massless fields
- Lagrangian formulation faces challenges due to the loss of ability to violate field equations in conventional quantum formulations.

**Mathematical Applications of Twistors**
- Used in mathematics, particularly in topology and geometry (Hodges, Baston & Eastwood, Mason & Woodhouse)
- Merkulov and Schwachhöfer's work on the algebraic structure of twistor space
- Gindikin's research on the relationship between the Penrose transform and Morse theory.

**Future Directions and Challenges**
- Reassessment needed to understand the true essence of Lagrangians in physical theory, especially regarding divergence problems (Penrose)
- Addressing these challenges may relate to concerns expressed at end of §26.6 about the nature of quantum path integrals.

#### Quantum-Gravity Challenges: Experimental Limitations and Future Prospects

**Fundamental puzzle in QFT and quantum gravity**
- Unresolved by conventional approaches to quantum gravity or string theory
- Author's attitude: less disturbed by this than many theorists

**Vacuum fluctuations and changes in foundations of quantum theory**
- Expects changes in foundation of quantum theory when a better quantum theory of gravity is developed
- Changes may include state vector reduction happening objectively (gravitational OR)

**Observed quantum phenomena**
- Consistent with expected changes, as they involve low energies and spontaneous state reduction not to be expected until measurement takes place

**Experiments testing gravitational OR scheme**
- Future experiments, such as FELIX space-borne proposal or related experiments, could test gravitational OR scheme and change outlook on quantum mechanics

**Problems with testing conventional quantum-gravity proposals**
- Experimental situations involve extremely high energies, beyond capabilities of any existing or projected particle accelerator
- Absence of experimental data has led to a consensus that real progress requires a quantum theory that encompasses gravity
- Current theoretical physics research focused on mathematical desiderata without physical guidance.

### 34.2: Mathematically driven fundamental physics

**The Interplay between Mathematical Ideas and Physical Behavior**
- **Progress in Physical Science**: Achieved through finding a balance between mathematical theory and precise observation of physical behavior
- **Mathematical Coherence**: Not a sufficient criterion for being 'on the right track', as aesthetic considerations play an important role
- **Aesthetic Criteria**: Subjective, but can guide researchers towards plausible proposals for new fundamental physics theories
- **Mathematical Beauty and Coherence**: Objective to some extent, but appreciation can be subjective depending on one's expertise
- **Physical Considerations**: Usually carry greater importance than mathematical qualities in the absence of experimental guidance
- **Example: Quaternions vs. Hamiltonians**:
  - **Quaternions**: Beautiful mathematical property of forming a division algebra, but had limited direct effect on mainstream physics
  - **Hamiltonians, Hamilton's Principle, and Hamiltonian Equations**: Influenced the development of quantum mechanics and QFT
- **Beauty in Mathematics for Physics**:
  - Good mathematics finds applications in disparate fields, often long after initial physical motivation
  - Precision and reliability of mathematical ideas from Nature stimulated by their agreement with physical laws
  - Subtlety of mathematics involved in Nature's laws is remarkable
- **String Theory**: Stimulates beautiful mathematical research but does not yet have observational evidence to prove its physics application

---

### 34.3: The role of fashion in physical theory

**The Role of Fashion in Physical Theory**

**Carlo Rovelli's Survey**:
- Quoted survey carried out by Carlo Rovelli, reported at International Congress on General Relativity and Gravitation (1997)
- Count of articles on quantum gravity published the previous year:
  - String theory: 69
  - Loop quantum gravity: 25
  - QFT in curved spaces: 8
  - Lattice approaches: 7
  - Euclidean quantum gravity: 3
  - Non-commutative geometry: 3
  - Quantum cosmology: 1
  - Twistors: 1
  - Others: 6
- Author's own research focus reflects the preponderance of string theory articles

**Scientific Plausibility vs. Fashion**:
- Majority rule in scientific research not ideal
- Importance of **mathematical coherence and agreement with observation** over popularity
- Influence of fashion on research:
  - New, exciting ideas spread quickly through communication networks
  - Competitiveness can lead to "bandwagon effects"
  - More impact for established, well-funded research areas
- Fashion plays a role in other areas like notation and formalism

**Example: Dirac vs. van der Waerden Spinor Calculi**:
- **Dirac (1928)**: Discovered electron's equation using 4-spinors
- **van der Waerden (1930)**: Developed more flexible and polished 2-spinor calculus
- Dirac later appreciated the power of van der Waerden's formalism but most researchers followed his original approach
- Researchers redid Dirac's work using tensor/4-spinor methods, which are now commonly quoted instead of Dirac's original work

---

#### Fashionable Theories and Expensive Experiments Influencing Physics Research

**Impact of Fashion on Theoretical Physics Research:**
* Dirac did not always follow fashion, but others sometimes were influenced by it
* Example: Bruno Zumino's experience with supersymmetry research
	+ Wrote a paper using 2-spinors to formulate an idea
	+ Abdus Salam published the same idea later using 4-spinors instead
	+ Zumino's paper overlooked due to Salam's publication
* Difficulty for young researchers:
	+ Overwhelmed by complex mathematical ideas in modern physics research
	+ Struggle to compare multiple lines of work
	+ Depend on established researchers' preferences when making choices
* Fashion influences experimental physics as well
	+ Expensive experiments require government or commercial funding
	+ Committees favor established perspectives for decision-making
	+ Difficulty in changing directions due to financial and political considerations.

### 34.4: Can a wrong theory be experimentally refuted?

**Experimental Refutation of Theories**

**Traditional Picture of Scientific Progression**:
- A wrong theory can be experimentally refuted, leading to the formulation of a new direction
- This is the traditional picture of how science progresses

**Challenges with Experimental Refutation**:
- In modern particle physics, there are theories like supersymmetry that have no experimental support but are still considered part of the "standard" model
- These theories predict the existence of "superpartners", which have not been observed yet due to symmetry-breaking mechanisms
- This makes it difficult to dislodge a popular theoretical idea through traditional methods of crucial experimentation, even if it is wrong

**Un-Popperian Character of Theories**:
- High expense of experiments makes it harder to test theories
- Some theories, like GUT or string theory, make predictions that are "quite safe from refutation" due to the mass-energies involved

**Dirac's Monopole Theory**:
- Dirac's argument that a magnetic monople could explain the fact that particles have integral multiples of a fixed electric charge
- The theory is un-Popperian and can only be established by the discovery of a monopole, not refuted by its absence

**Cosmological Theories**:
- Theories about the universe beyond our observable horizon are "un-Popperian" as they cannot be directly confirmed or disproved
- Even if K = 0 is the most Popperian of these theories, it still requires other justifications for acceptance

---

#### Fashion Influence on Inflationary Cosmology Debate

**Inflationary Cosmology: Status and Critique from a Popperian Perspective**

**Background:**
- Fashionable yet almost considered part of standard model of cosmology (§28.4)
- Claimed adherence to Popper's refutability principle with K = 0 as an implication
- Detailed predictions about microwave background, particularly scale invariance

**Challenges:**
- Observations suggest matter density falls short of required flatness (K ≠ 0)
- Inflation theorists began to accommodate K < 0
- Hawking school perceived ways for negative cosmological constant within their scheme
- Controversy over observations: BOOMERanG vs. Vahe Gurzadyan's analysis

**Implications:**
- Exotic proposals, such as 'quintessence' and a new phase of inflation (Steinhardt et al., 1999)
- Strong influences of scientific fashion on theoretical research
- Objectivity vs. subjectivity in understanding physical world

**Key Points:**
1. **Inflationary cosmology**: Fashionable, almost part of standard model of cosmology since the 1980s.
2. **Popper's refutability principle**: Originally claimed that K = 0 is an implication; however, observations challenging this assumption have led to modifications in theories.
3. **Observational evidence**: Over the years, there have been inconsistencies between observational data and predictions made by inflationary models, particularly regarding spatial flatness (K).
4. **Quintessence proposal**: A new ingredient introduced to provide an effective cosmological constant through a dynamical 'dark energy'.
5. **Scientific research influences**: Strong influences of scientific fashion on theoretical research can lead to controversial interpretations and analyses of observational data.
6. **Objectivity vs. subjectivity**: Objective physical world versus our gropings for understanding its nature, where social pressures, funding, and human weaknesses play significant roles in the chaotic and often mutually inconsistent pictures we are confronted with today.

---

### 34.5: Whence may we expect our next physical revolution?

**Expectations for Future Physical Revolution**
* Current progress towards fundamental understanding of physics: pessimistic in popular accounts, but realistic and considerable progress is still possible
* Huge amount of observational data awaiting analysis
* Clues to Nature's ways hidden in modern observations
* New perspectives needed to address issues raised by measurement paradox in quantum mechanics and non-locality (EPR effects)
* Possible developments: FELIX experiment, tests for higher dimensionality in spacetime, theoretical considerations
* Frameworks like twistor theory may provide insights but have not yet significantly advanced our understanding
* New insights and perspectives needed: 'new Einstein' or immensely puzzling experimental findings?
* Teamwork and fashionable ideas common in current research; mathematical aesthetics crucial for deeper physical understanding, especially at fundamental levels.

---

#### Reconciling Diverse Theories in Quantum Physics: Challenges and Possibilities

**Criteria for Achieving Reliable Mathematical Framework**
- Difficulty in laying down criteria due to contradictory mathematical approaches
- Different developments guided by their own set of aesthetic criteria
- Synthesis as a potential solution?
  * Bringing all these approaches together
  * Distilling what is appropriate from the body of all of them taken together
- Reasonable argument against synthesis:
  * Contradictions between different approaches are too great
  * One approach can survive, with others discarded
- Truth likely lies somewhere in between
- Possibility of finding importance in theories whose major tenets will eventually have to be abandoned

**Common Ground Among Some Theories**
- Loop variable approach (Chapter 32) and twistor theory (Chapter 33) share significant features
- Combination of ideas from both could lead to a way forward

**Differences Between String Theory and Other Approaches**
- Insistence on higher dimensions in string theory violates the holomorphic philosophy of twistor theory
- String theory has not provided a consistent (1+3)-dimensional theory until recently
  * Recent shift: applications of string-theoretic ideas to ordinary (1+3)-dimensional spacetime taken seriously.

---

### 34.6: What is reality?

**Reality: A Quest for Understanding**

**Key Insights:**
- The search for physical reality remains elusive despite scientific progress
- Some question whether a truly objective, independent reality exists
- Modern scientists evade the 'what' question about reality
- Physical reality is often seen as reflecting mathematical laws
- Platonic world of mathematical ideals may provide a kind of reality to mathematical notions

**Three Worlds and Three Mysteries:**
- Reality can be understood in terms of three interconnected worlds: Platonic-mathematical, physical, and mental
- Each world has its own kind of reality, founded on the one that precedes it
- The cyclic aspect of these worlds is a mystery, where each seems to encompass the succeeding one while depending only upon a small part of its predecessor.

---

### 34.7: The roles of mentality in physical theory

**Role of Mentality in Physical Theory**

**Distinctive Worlds:**
- Three worlds: mental, physical, and mathematical
- Each possesses its unique existence
- Cannot be studied in isolation from others

**Mentality in Physical Theory**
- Role of consciousness in understanding reality
  - Anthropic principle (AP)
    * Universe must support conscious mentality
    * Constraints on physical laws or parameters
    * Difficulties: little knowledge about consciousness
  - Quantum mechanics interpretations
    * Copenhagen interpretation
      * Wavefunction exists in observer's mind
      * Depends on a perceiving being
      * Stopgap positions: environmental decoherence and many-worlds interpretation
        **Environmental decoherence**
          * Inaccessible information is not lost objectively
          * Throws us back to conscious observer question
          * Many-worlds interpretation remains incomplete
        **Many-worlds interpretation**
          * Dependent on proper understanding of conscious observers
          * Behavior of objective world depends on consciousness
    * Consistent histories approach (CHA)
      * Implicitly dependent on some notion of observer
    * Wigner's point of view: consciousness might violate U evolution
  - De Broglie-Bohm interpretation and some fundamental changes in quantum mechanics rules do not necessarily depend upon a conscious observer.

---

#### Quantum Consciousness and Gravitational Orchestrated Reduction

**Viewpoints on Objective Reduction (OR) and Consciousness**

**Adherent of Spontaneous OR with Gravity**:
- Believes in spontaneous OR process occurring without conscious observer
- Multiple manifestations lead to classical world emerging on large scale
- No need for conscious observer during measurement

**Role of Consciousness**:
- Real physical process arising in the world
- Fundamentally uses actual OR process
- Controversial position, reversed from those who envision consciousness causing OR

**Experimental Testability**:
- Brain structures like A-lattice neuronal microtubules and synaptic clathrins may be relevant
- Large-scale quantum coherence required across brain regions
- Conscious event involves partial state reduction (orchestrated OR) of quantum system
- Encouraging preliminary results from tests on binding problem by Andrew Duggins

**Emergence of Consciousness**:
- Some argue consciousness emerges as epiphenomenon, no importance for precise physics underlying processes
- Opposes this view, arguing that consciousness depends on missing (gravitational) OR theory
- Demands non-computational theory to accommodate conscious mentality

**Current Status**:
- Theoretical ideas for producing an OR model are in a preliminary stage.

### 34.8: Our long mathematical road to reality

**Unity of Mathematics and Physical Reality: A Journey Through Time**

**Key Insight:**
- Mathematical unity with physical world since ancient Greece (Figs. 1.3 and 34.1)
- Deep underlying simplicity for ultimate goal
- Successful understanding of universe operations at deepest levels

**Mathematical Concepts:**
1. Real number system
   * Ancient Greeks to Archimedes, Fermat, Newton, Leibniz, Euler, Cauchy, Cartan, etc.
2. Geometry: Euclidean and beyond (Lambert, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Riemann)
   * Minkowski's spacetime geometry in general relativity
3. Calculus and differential equations
   * Archimedes to Einstein, Euler, Cauchy, Cartan, etc.
4. Statistical ideas (Maxwell, Boltzmann, Gibbs, Einstein)
5. Quantum theory foundation: complex numbers vs real numbers

**Complex Numbers:**
- Recurring theme in understanding universe at deepest levels
- Questionable universal role in quantum mechanics
  * Some physicists view it as mathematical utility
- Mystery needing explanation for its importance in physics
- Nothing more 'natural' about real numbers than complex numbers from a mathematical perspective.

**Complexity in Physics:**
- Real structures play significant part in physics despite being non-holomorphic in standard formalism of quantum mechanics
  * Hermitian operators, unitary quantum evolution, orthogonality between states
- Important property of complex numbers: holomorphicity (complex analyticity)
  * Broken during conversion of 'quantum information' into 'classical information' through measurements.

---

#### Discussion on Symmetry and Broken Symmetry in Quantum Theory

**Orthogonality of Alternatives in Measurement and Quantum Theory:**
- Non-holomorphicity enters at point of measurement introduction into quantum theory
- Real numbers, including background spacetime, play a role in formalism of quantum theory
- If gravitational OR turns out to be true basis for state reduction, real number (non-holomorphic) structure of actual spacetime could relate to operation z ↦ z
- Twistor theory may have lessons regarding reliance on holomorphic operations versus a discrete underlying structure
- Deep mathematical issues concerning physical reality's mathematical basis are at stake

**Symmetry in Modern Physical Theory:**
- Utility of symmetry in both relativity and quantum theories is undeniable
- Symmetry debated as fundamental or incidental/approximate feature in particle physics
- Exact symmetry necessary for bundle connection idea (electroweak theory)
- Difficulties with invoking early universe for symmetry breaking apply to U(2) symmetry of electroweak and larger symmetries in GUT theories
- Debate on which type of broken symmetry situation will be more significant in future theory
- Riemann sphere example shows exact symmetry group can emerge without initial imposition
- Pure number constants of Nature: debated between arising from early universe or deeper underlying theory
- Chiral asymmetry of weak interactions built into standard model vs. massive neutrinos and possible spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios.

### 34.9: Beauty and miracles

**Mathematics and Physical Theory**

**Beauty and Elegance in Physics Research:**
- Driving forces influencing theoretical research
- Often unmentioned due to fear of being seen as unscientific
- Examples: Euclidean geometry, Newtonian dynamics, Maxwell's electromagnetism, Einstein's general relativity, quantum mechanics
- Question if the undoubted mathematical beauty would stand alone without reference to the physical world
- Many beautiful developments in mathematics with minimal relation to physics (Cantor's theory of the infinite, Gödel's theorem, category theory)
  - Some speculation for future connections in 21st century physics
- Examples: Fermat's Last Theorem, Riemann's ζ-function and distribution of prime numbers
- Intriguing connections with physics but not physical theories
- Question if all of Platonic mathematical world lies at the base of 'first mystery'
- Difficulty perceiving what kind of mathematics finds a deep role in governing physical behavior.

**Mathematical Beauty as Ambiguous Guide:**
- Role of aesthetic judgements in research decisions
- Subtle character, personal matter to follow most attractive lines of research.

#### Quantum Gravity Miracles and Their Interpretations in Supergravity and String Theory

**Miracles in Mathematical Theories of Physical World**
* Occasional discoveries in mathematical research have a profound impact beyond mere mathematical elegance, called 'miracles'
* Examples: supergravity theory and mirror symmetries in string/M-theory (§31.2, §31.14)
  * Supergravity: non-renormalizable divergences canceled out with the introduction of supersymmetry but returned when calculating to higher orders
  * Mirror symmetries: seemingly unrelated string theories united into M-theory through magic calculations like those by Candelas and colleagues
* Importance of miracles in physical theory development
  * Can provide impressive confirmation, as in Dirac's spin equation or Einstein's general relativity theory
  * Less clear impact for purely mathematical miracles like supergravity or mirror symmetry
* Caution needed when using miracles as guides to correctness of an approach to a physical theory (§33.14)
* Personal experience with twistor theory: discovery of homogeneous functions and non-linear graviton construction considered 'miracles' but may not be unambiguous indicators of its validity
* Recent developments in applying string theory to standard 4D spacetime physics, changing the nature of Riemann surfaces (projective twistor space) could have significance for understanding the relevance of past miracles in M-theory.

- Weak force responsible for some dramatic events
  - Volcanic eruptions (Krakatoa in 1883, Thera/Santorini around 1628 BC)
  - Potential impact on ancient Greek culture growth

**Physics and Quasars**
- Most violent explosions in the universe caused by weakest force: gravitation (about 10–40 of electric force, in a hydrogen atom)
- Black holes fuel quasar's unbelievable power
- Distance from Earth prevents brightness perception.

#### Mysteries of Black Holes and Quantum Gravity

**Mysterious Objects in the Universe: Black Holes and Unresolved Issues**
* Spacetime singularities at black hole cores remain deeply mysterious, beyond present-day theories' capabilities to describe
* Other profound mysteries exist, such as the nature of reality and consciousness
* 21st century may bring new insights through different perspectives or powerful ideas

**Black Holes: Properties and Controversies**
* Cores of black holes: spacetime singularities with profound mysteries
* Other unresolved issues include economy versus consistency in mathematical structures

**Physics Theories and Alternative Perspectives**
* Need for subtle changes in perspective to advance understanding
* Playful ideas, such as those by Aldiss and Penrose (2000), have been proposed

**Relationship between Mathematics and Physics**
* Wigner's view: Unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in physical sciences
* Gleason's opposing view: Mathematics is the science of order
* Personal perspective closer to Wigner than Gleason

**Unified Theories and Significance of Riemann Hypothesis**
* Connection between the Riemann hypothesis, physics, and mathematics
* Relevance of Euler's ζ-function in physics through 'ζ-function regularization'

**Advanced Topics: Yang–Mills Processes and σ-Models**
* Tree Yang–Mills processes: genus-0 condition (no closed loops)
