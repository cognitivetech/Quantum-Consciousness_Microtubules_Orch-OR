# Plant Microtubules Development and Flexibility 2nd Edition Volume Editor: Peter Nick

> Plant microtubules are key elements of cell growth, division and morphogenesis. In addition to their role in plant development and architecture, they have emerged as regulatory elements of signalling and important targets of evolution.
> 
> Since the publication of the first edition of Plant Microtubules in 2000, our understanding of microtubules and their manifold functions have advanced substantially. Consisting of the following three parts, this book highlights the morphogenetic potential of plant microtubules from three general viewpoints: Microtubules and Morphogenesis: control of cell axis during division and expansion, cross-talk with actin filaments, mechanical properties of the cell wall. Microtubules and Environment: the role of microtubules during the sensing or response of environmental factors such as pathogens or abiotic stresses. Microtubules and Evolution: complexity and specialization of plant microtubules in the context of plant evolution. - [Plant Microtubules (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Plant-Microtubules-Development-Flexibility-Monographs/dp/3540771751?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Crossed-Wires: Interactions and Cross-Talk Between the Microtubule and Microfilament Networks in Plants

**Plant Cell Microtubules**
- Cytoskeleton in plant cells comprises:
  - Distinct, dynamic arrays of microtubules (25nm diameter) and actin microlaments (7nm diameter)
  - Conserved basic structures and proteins occur in all eukaryotic organisms, including plants
- No presence of intermediate filaments in plant cells

**Microtubule-Microlament Interactions**
- Early studies based on static images showed coalignment of microlaments with microtubules
- Functional and molecular studies revealed:
  - Coordination between dynamic microtubules and microlaments is necessary for growth and development
  - Cross-talk exists between the two networks
- **Microtubulemicrolament cross-talk**: any type of relationship between microtubules and microlaments

**Direct Interactions**
- Section 1: Reassessment of early work on colocalization between microtubules and microlaments
- Section 2: Proteins mediating direct microtubulemicrolament interactions, e.g., Kinesin-like proteins

**Indirect Interactions**
- **Microtubulemicrolament coordination**: organelle movement and shaping
  - Both networks play a role without direct involvement with each other
- **Rop-signalling pathway**: indirect but specific interactions between networks

**Review Conclusion**
- Microtubules and microlaments function independently in many roles within plant cells
- When these two networks interact and cross-talk occurs, dissecting the relationship can be challenging.

### Microtubules and Pathogen Defence

**Plant Cell Monograph (11) P. Nick: Plant Microtubules**

**Key Points:**
- Plant cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure responding to external stimuli
- Pathogen attack is an external stress threatening plant survival
- Recent research indicates microtubules and microlaments are central players in plant defence responses
- Tubulin and actin inhibitors suppress cellular events related to plant defence, allowing non-pathogenic fungi to penetrate into non-host plants
- Cytoskeletal elements control responses conferring resistance to attempted fungal penetration
- Hypersensitive cell death involves elements of the plant cytoskeleton
- Several plant pathogens produce anti-cytoskeletal compounds during invasion, suggesting the plant cytoskeleton is an advantageous target for pathogens and symbionts
- Potential to enhance plant resistance to pathogens via artificial manipulation of cytoskeletal elements will be discussed

**Dynamic Reorganization of the Cytoskeleton During Pathogen Attack:**
- Plant cytoskeleton responds adaptively to external stimuli, including:
  - Gravitropic stimulation (Perbal and Driss-Ecole 2003; Wasteneys 2000)
  - Low temperature (Browse and Xin 2001)
  - Hormone treatment (Ishida and Katsumi 1991)
  - Wounding (La Claire 1989)
- Increasing evidence suggests the plant cytoskeleton is a key player in the defence against pathogens, including:
  - Viruses (Microtubules and viral movement)
  - Fungi
  - Oomycete species
  - Possibly bacteria

### Microtubules and Viral Movement

**Plant Cell Monograph: Plant Microtubules**

**Introduction:**
- Spread of plant virus infection relies on specialized movement proteins (MP) that target plasmodesmata for viral movement
- Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV): four major protein products: replicase proteins, MP, and CP
  - Replicases: not discussed in this article
  - CP: required for long-distance transport but not cell-to-cell movement

**Microtubules and Viral Movement:**
1. **Role of Microtubules (MT) during Infection:**
   - Additional contacts with MT cytoskeleton facilitate viral RNA transport
   - Studies on TMV MP: associates with membranes, endoplasmic reticulum actin network, and MTs
2. **Interactions Between MP and MT:**
   - Recent findings describe interactions between MP and MT during early and late stages of infection
3. **Importance in Virus Infection:**
   - Understanding these interactions crucial for developing strategies to control virus spread.

### Microtubules as Sensors for Abiotic Stimuli

**Peter Nick's Research: Microtubules as Sensors for Abiotic Stimuli**

**Key Findings**:
- Microtubules have complex and nonlinear dynamics, indicating they play a role in more volatile events beyond structural functions.
- Microtubules are subject to numerous signalling chains, especially in plants with tight control over morphogenesis.
- Microtubules not only receive signals but also actively participate in signal transduction.

**Challenges for Abiotic Stimuli Perception**:
- Physical stimuli must be transformed into biological outputs.
- The primary input energy is extremely small and needs to be amplified efficiently.
- Plant cells face challenges due to continuous internal and external pressure, requiring fine discrimination of mechanical energy changes.
- The lack of specialized sensory organs necessitates each cell producing sufficient sensory output on its own.

**Microtubules as Mechanosensors**:
- This research will emphasize the mechanosensory properties of microtubules.
- Proposed mechanism: Nonlinear dynamics of microtubule assembly provide a strong and sensitive amplifier for detecting minute mechanical stimuli.
- Examples of abiotic sensing using this mechanism: gravi- and cold-sensing adaptation to harsh environments.

### Plant Tubulin Genes: Regulatory and Evolutionary Aspects

**Plant Cell Monograph (11) P. Nick: Plant Microtubules**

**DOI:** 10.1007/7089_2007_160/Published online: 29 January 2008

**Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008**

**Plant Tubulin Genes:** Regulatory and Evolutionary Aspects
- **Diego Breviario**, Istituto Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria, CNR, Via Bassini 15, 20133 Milan, Italy (breviario@ibba.cnr.it)

**Abstract:**
- Plant tubulin genes encode for tubulin, a major cytoskeletal protein that forms microtubules (MTs).
- The post-genomic era has not diminished the fascination of investigating tubulin expression and subunit turnover, assembly into MTs, and control of MT dynamics and positioning.
- This area is referred to as "microTUBULOMICS," recognizing the various aspects influencing tubulin expression and interaction with proteins and drugs (Fig. 1).

**1. All Aboard - Tubulin Genes at the Nuclear Station:**
- Tubulin synthesis and availability are initially controlled at the nuclear transcription level.
- The plant cell can choose which tubulin isoforms from both alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin gene families to express, depending on the cell cycle, stage of development, tissue, organ, and stimuli.
- Nuclear mRNA transcription is regulated by promoters and 5'/3' sequences that annex the coding region (examples: Chu et al., 1998; Stotz and Long, 1999; Abe et al., 2004).
- The specificity of expression for a tubulin isotype can be determined by analyzing the promoter/regulatory sequence's activity pattern.
- Several laboratories have recorded the specific expression patterns of different tubulin gene nucleotides (overs, adpolleon, fungalization).

### Microtubules and the Evolution of Mitosis

**Plant Cell Monograph (11) P. Nick: Plant Microtubules**

**DOI:** 10.1007/7089_2007_161/Published online: 6 February 2008

**Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008**

**Abstract:**
- The organization of microtubules in plants differs significantly from animals
- Differences include structural organization and composition of associated proteins
- Evolutionary transition to multicellular plants involved rhythmic changes in division axis and mitotic microtubule arrays

**Background:**
- Microtubules play a crucial role in plant mitosis
- Structural differences between plant and animal microtubules
  * Higher plants have cortical microtubules or phragmoplast, while animals have centrioles
  - Centrioles progressively reduced in higher plants, absent in most seed plants
- Molecular composition of associated proteins deviate from important animal microtubule associated proteins (MAPs)

**Microtubules and Evolution:**
- Divergence between plant and animal microtubules rooted in prokaryotic ancestors
  * Walled eubacteria vs. mycoplasmas that lack a cell wall
- Lower eukaryotes exhibit variations on this theme
- Chromatin/nucleus relation with nucleus associated organelle (NAO) crucial for mitosis realization
- Higher Chlorophyta develop most microtubule structures characteristic for higher plants
  * Interpretation ambiguous due to possible convergent developments and limited understanding of phylogenetic relationships in many algae taxa

**Transition to Terrestrial Lifestyle:**
- Microtubular cytoskeleton of higher plants already developed at time of terrestrial shift
  * Progressive reduction of centriolar functions
  * Increasing predominance of acentriolar microtubule organization
- Evolutionary footprints still exist, difficult to interpret solely in terms of current function
  * Cytoplasmic occurrence of tubulin ancestor FtsZ in mosses or intranuclear tubulin.
