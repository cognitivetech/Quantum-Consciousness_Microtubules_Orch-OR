**Preparation of Microtubule Protein and Purified Tubulin from Bovine Brain**

**Isolation and Biochemistry of Tubulin**:
- Mammalian brain is the most commonly used starting material for tubulin purification
- Reasons to use mammalian brain:
  - High tubulin concentration in brain, especially in young animals
  - Microtubules readily assemble at 30-37C and depolymerize at cold temperatures (0-4C)
  - High content of assembly-promoting/stabilizing microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) like MAP2 and tau

**Protocols**:

**A. Optimal Starting Material and Initial Processing**:
- Freshness of Brains: Age and Sex of the Animals
  - Yield of polymerization-competent tubulin is highly dependent on brain freshness
  - Brains are obtained from a commercial slaughterhouse within 3 hours of kill
  - Immediately separate brains into 125g hemispheres and place in plastic bags buried in ice to reduce chill time

#### Purification of Microtubule Protein from Bovine Brains

**Factors Influencing Microtubule Protein (MTP) Yield in Brain Extracts:**

**Animal Age and Gender**:
- Older dairy cows at slaughter house (5-7 years old) yield less MTP per gram of fresh brain tissue compared to young steers
- Younger animals, especially those raised for beef (2 years old), produce more assembly-competent protein
- Important that younger animals are preferred over older ones for better yields

**Brain Condition**:
- Animals stunned with a pistol can result in skull damage and hemorrhage, reducing MTP yield
- Removal of damaged brain tissue is crucial to minimize the impact on surrounding tissue
- Meningeal removal increases protein yield by facilitating homogenization and reducing blood contamination

**Processing Speed and Temperature**:
- Rapid isolation of tubulin and associated proteins is essential for maintaining their integrity
- Polymerization at 30C instead of 37C ensures robust recovery of assembly-competent tubulin
- Precise temperature control during centrifugation steps is crucial to maintain optimal conditions

**Protocol for Purification of Microtubule Protein (Tubulin Plus Microtubule-Associated Proteins) in the Absence of Glycerol**:
- Procedure modifies Asnes and Wilson's method (1979) to isolate MTP from any brain source
- Flowchart illustrates the purification protocol, which involves several centrifugation steps
- Preparing crude brain extract (CBE), homogenizing, and removing impurities before obtaining soluble or pelleted MTP

#### Extraction and Purification of Non-Neural Tubulin from Various Sources

**Serine Peptidases and Protease Inhibitors for Isolating Tubulin from Nonneural Sources**

**Presence of Serine Peptidases in Leishmania Genome**:
- Benzamidine (1 mM) and PMSF (0.5 mM) are used in extraction buffers due to the presence of serine peptidases in Leishmania genome

**Polyphenol Oxidase Activity and Reducing Agents**:
- Plant cells have proteases and polyphenol oxidase activity which can degrade and crosslink proteins during purification
- Reducing agents like 15 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) inhibit polyphenol oxidase activity
- If buffer solution turns brown, add more DTT to sample

**Protease Inhibitors**:
- Use abundant protease inhibitors: antipain, aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 10 g/ml, BAME and TAME at 50 ml, and PMSF at 1 mM
- Make stocks of each using appropriate solvents rather than commercially available combination tablets
- Keep extraction buffer pH neutral and use Mg2+ and EGTA to further inhibit protease activity

**Cell Disruption Methods**:

**Vertebrate Tissues**:
- Homogenize cells/tissues in 2 ml/g of PME with appropriate protease inhibitors
- Sonication on ice is effective for cell lysis
- Check degree of cell lysis by microscopy

- Efficient tubulin purification requires >95% cell disruption

**Saccharomyces cerevisiae Disruption**:
- Most efficient method is using a microfluidizer device to disrupt 95% of cells

**Leishmania Disruption**:
- Extensive sonication required to liberate tubulin heterodimers from stable subpellicular and flagellar microtubules

#### Isolating Tubulin from Non-Neural Sources Protocol and Notes

**Microtubule Assembly from Eluted Tubulin**

**Step 5. Polymerize the tubulin and pellet microtubules:**
- Induced with GTP and DMSO for assembly
- Incubated at 37C for 60 minutes, then spun at 50,000 rpm/2g at 30C for 30 minutes
- Pelleted microtubules resuspended in cold PME buffer (~10 mg/ml or higher) and further solubilized via probe sonication (10-30 x 5s bursts at 10W)
- Tubulin solution incubated on ice for 30 minutes, then spun at 50,000 rpm/2g at 4C for 30 minutes to remove insoluble contaminants

**Step 6. Adjust the tubulin concentration, aliquot, and store:**
- Supernatant containing heterodimeric tubulin stored at -80C in 50l aliquots or drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen
- Tubulin concentration can be determined by UV absorbance or dilution in neutral SDS

**Isolating Tubulin from Nonneural Sources:**
1. **Ion exchange step**: Equilibrate DEAE resin, use enough for preparation, and optimize prep with SDS gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting.
2. **Optimizing the prep**: Determine all tubulin is absorbed from loading solution and sufficient elution volume to recover bulk of tubulin; keep more than arbitrary cutoff if necessary.
3. **Verifying presence of assembly-competent tubulin**: Perform microplate assembly assays using column fractions, DMSO (10% v/v), and GTP (1mM) for faster identification of tubulin-rich fractions.
4. **Quantifying concentration of tubulin per cell**: Prepare cell lysates, run dilution series with purified tubulin standards, and determine relative intensity by immunoblotting.

### Chapter 3: Characterization of Anti  tubulin Antibodies

**Characterization of Anti-b-Tubulin Antibodies**

**Introduction**:
- Tubulin antibodies are widely used in cell and molecular biology research
- This chapter outlines characterization practices for anti-b-tubulin antibodies

**I. The Characterization of AA2, a Pan-specific Anti-b-Tubulin Monoclonal Antibody That Reacts with All Vertebrate b-Tubulin Isotypes (Gene Products)**:
- **AA2**: A pan-specific anti-b-tubulin monoclonal antibody that reacts with all vertebrate b-tubulin isotypes
- **Epitope Recognition**: Located within the C-terminal domain of b-tubulin (amino acids 412-430)
- Highly conserved region in most human and mouse b-tubulin isotypes, except for the megakaryocyte-specific class VI b-tubulin (bVI)
- Generated using phosphocellulose-purified bovine brain tubulin as immunogen
- Specificity confirmed through Western blotting and peptide/protein affinity chromatography

**II. The Characterization of Isotype-Specific b-Tubulin Monoclonal and Polyclonal Antibodies**:
- **Isotype-specific b-tubulin antibodies**: Used for biochemical analyses and immunocytochemistry

#### Characterization of Glutamylated Tubulin Antibodies

**B-Tubulin Isotype-Specific Antibodies**

**Generation of B-Tubulin Isotype-Specific Antibodies**:
- Most isotype-specific antibodies were produced using synthetic peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)
- Each peptide was identical to the extreme C-terminal isotype-defining domain of a b-tubulin isotype
- MBP fusion proteins were constructed for each human and mouse b-tubulin C-terminal isotype-defining domain, which have advantages over synthetic peptides

**Failure in Producing Anti-BIV and Anti-BIo Antibodies**:
- Sequences of the synthetic peptides used as immunogens were identical to the last 36 amino acids for bI and bIV
- This high similarity may have contributed to the failure in producing specific anti-BIV and anti-BIo antibodies
- Other investigators have been successful in generating monoclonal antibodies specific for these two isotypes

**Overcoming Potential Cross-Reactions**:
- To overcome potential cross-reactions, a strategy was used of immunizing with truncated synthetic peptides that minimize the influence of flanking sequences
- This approach was used to generate anti-human bV and anti-mouse bV polyclonal antibodies
- More recently, this strategy was used to generate antibodies that recognize the -glutamyl link in glutamylated tubulin

**Glutamylation of Tubulin**:
- Tubulin is a substrate for several posttranslational modifications, including glutamylation
- Glutamylation results in the formation of a string of glutamate residues linked through the side chain of a glutamate residue in the polypeptide backbone
- The number of glutamate residues can vary from 1 to many, with the initial one added through a -carboxyl link
- Glutamylation is catalyzed by amino acid ligases belonging to the ATP-grasp superfamily of enzymes

---

#### Characterization of Anti-bIII Tubulin Antibodies Specificity and Competitive ELISA Testing

**Glutamylation of Tubulins in Brain**
- Glutamylated tubulin is a major posttranslational modification in mature rodent and bovine brain tubulin (>96%)
- Lower proportion of glutamylated tubulin in other organs (V. Redeker and A. Frankfurter, unpublished observations)
- Developmentally regulated, with increased number of residues during early postnatal development (Redeker et al., 2004)
- Produces heterogeneous population of glutamylated tubulin subunits
- Evidence for deglutamylation by unidentified hydrolases

**Studying Glutamylation of Tubulins**
- Custom synthesis of glutamylated and nonglutamylated peptides required (significant cost)
- Six specific g-Glu antibodies generated: two mouse monoclonals, four rabbit polyclonals
- Focus on bII and bIII isotypes, as they are the most abundant in brain
- 7D2, a mouse monoclonal antibody against a monoglutamylated peptide (Table II)

**Characterization of Anti-b-tubulin Antibodies 39**
- Initial characterization with dot blots: specificity for g-glutamyl linkage (Fig. 4)
- Competitive ELISAs confirm specificity: reaction with purified brain tubulin and monoglutamated peptide, not unmodified fusion protein or other peptides (Fig. 5)

**Table II**: Immunogens used for generating anti-g-glutamyl antibodies.

---

#### Characterization of Anti-b-tubulin Antibodies through Immunoaffinity Chromatography

**Characterization of Anti--Tubulin Antibodies**

**Competitive ELISA**:
- 7D2 preferentially reacts with monoglutamylated peptide, binding approximately one to two orders of magnitude less efficiently to diglutamylated peptide
- Does not react at all with triglutamylated or non-glutamylated peptides
- Purified adult rat brain tubulin was passed through a column loaded with 7D2 coupled to CNBr, and the retentate analyzed by mass spectrometry
- Identified primarily monoglutamylated bIII, and to a much lesser extent diglutamylated bIII

**Western Blot of Whole Human Organ Extracts**:
- 7D2 recognizes multiple polypeptides with masses ranging from ~25 to 200 kDa

**Native Electrophoresis: Methods A. Native Gels and Western Blotting**

**Techniques for Separating Proteins**:
- Blue native electrophoresis is a popular technique to study membrane proteins, but now used more widely
- Most native electrophoresis systems use acrylamide-gradient gels
- Native continuous-buffer system allows the addition of glycerol or nonionic detergents in the buffer

**Preparing the Gel**:
- Use 75-100 ml Erlenmeyer flask
- Mix ProtoGel (30% acrylamide/0.8% bisacrylamide) with MES, MgCl2, EGTA, APS, TEMED, and Milli-Q water
- Pour gel into gel cast and let polymerize for 30-60 minutes
- Change buffer in cathode chamber every 2 hours when running a 14 cm/216 cm gel

**Transferring Proteins**:
- After native electrophoresis, proteins can be transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane for immunodetection
- Transfer conditions are the same as conventional SDS gels

**Tubulin Stability Assessed Using Nondenaturing Gels**:
- Purification of tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins using reversible assembly methods
- Quality and quantity assessed by SDS-PAGE, but does not indicate aggregation state or competency for further experiments
- Freezing can cause tubulin aggregate formation, so gel filtration is recommended to polish tubulin dimers

**Gel Filtration Columns**:
- Use Superdex 200, Superose 6, or Superose 12 columns from Pharmacia GE Healthcare
- Tubulin is usually stored at 80C after purification through phosphocellulose column
- About 500 g of purified tubulin (12 g/l) is injected into the gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A

#### Temperature and Freezing Effects on Tubulin Stability

**Tubulin Stability and Denaturation: Effects of Freezing, Thawing, Temperature, and Solvents**
- Tubulin proteins form stable dimers when analyzed using nondenaturing gels (Fig. 2)
- Stability tests conducted on tubulin in buffer A revealed that:
  - Glycerol preserves tubulin from denaturation or aggregation after multiple freeze-thaw cycles (Fig. 3A and B)
    * 50% of total tubulin aggregated/unfolded after 8 freeze-thaw cycles with glycerol
    * Greater effect seen in presence of DMSO (20% unfolded after only two cycles)
  - Freezing and thawing has a greater impact on tubulin stability in the presence of DMSO compared to glycerol
- Tubulin's instability is believed to occur after several hours at 4C (Fig. 4A)
  * At both temperatures, dimers remain stable for 8 hours, but percentage of active dimers declines over time:
    * 65% remains after 20 hours at 4C and 30% at 30C (panel C)
    * After 30 hours, stability compromised due to degradation (panel B)
- **Pulse chase experiments** can be used to study tubulin folding kinetics and in vitro synthesized products.

**Tubulin Folding: Molecular Chaperones and Cofactors**
- Correct folding of tubulins and generation of functional heterodimers require molecular chaperones like prefoldin, CCT (chaperonin-containing Tcp-1), and various tubulin-folding cofactors (reviewed in Fanarraga et al., 2001, 2003)

**Tubulin Synthesis: Pulse Chase Experiments and Complex Formation**
- Full-length cDNA of a6-tubulin cloned into vectors for in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of 35S-methionine for 20 minutes at 30C (Fig. 5)
- After lag period, synthesis stopped by adding cold methionine and RNAse A

**Monitoring Subtilisin Digestion:**
- Progress monitored using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig. 7)
  * Aliquots of digested tubulin loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing gel
  * Single band observed for untreated tubulin dimers, slower migrating band for S-tubulin dimers due to greater net charge at pH 6.7 after removal of carboxy-terminal domain

**Stability Study of In Vivo Tubulin Complexes:**
- Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis used to examine stability of TBCA/b-tubulin complex in HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 1, complex V)
- Fresh soluble fraction vs. extract stored at 4C for 48 or 96 hours
- Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antiserum against TBCA showed that the complex was present in fresh extract but absent after storage, indicating instability under these conditions.

### Chapter 6: Mass Spectrometry Analysis of C Terminal Posttranslational Modifications of Tubulins

**Mass Spectrometry Analysis of C-Terminal Posttranslational Modifications of Tubulins**

**Introduction**:
- Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of tubulin's C-terminal isotype-defining domain play a major role in the heterogeneity of tubulins in brain and ciliary axonemes.
- These PTMs include polyglutamylation, polyglycylation, detyrosination, tyrosination, removal of penultimate glutamate residue, and phosphorylation.
- To document the relationship and functions of these PTMs, a tubulin C-terminal Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF) method was developed.

**Methods**:
1. Tubulin and microtubule proteins purification:
   - Simplified microtubule proteins and tubulin C-terminal peptides are purified.
2. Proteolytic cleavage and production of the C-terminal isotype-defining peptides:
   - Tubulins are subjected to proteolytic cleavage, generating the C-terminal peptides.
3. Purification of C-terminal peptides:
   - The purified C-terminal peptides are further separated based on their isotype and PTMs.
4. MALDI-MS analysis of C-terminal peptides:
   - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is used to analyze the purified C-terminal peptides, generating a complete picture of all tubulin isotype-specific C-terminal peptides together with their respective PTMs.
5. Structural characterization of polymodifications:
   - Complementary MS-based approaches are presented to document the structure of highly heterogeneous posttranslational polymodifications.

**Results and Discussion**:
1. Tubulin C-Terminal Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF) method:
   - Direct MALDI-MS analysis of purified tubulin C-terminal peptides can reveal changes in PTMs between samples with different tubulin assembly properties or consecutively to modification site mutations.
2. Posttranslational polyglycylation of axonemal tubulins from Paramecium cilia:
   - The presence of glutamate residues at position 403 in the C-terminus of a-tubulin correlates with its capacity to form axoneme microtubules.
3. Posttranslational polyglutamylation of brain tubulins:
   - Brain tubulin isoforms can exhibit up to six glutamate residues at position 401 in the C-terminus.
4. Changes in PTMs consequently to polymodification site mutations:
   - Mutation of a-tubulin's penultimate glutamate residue (position 402) interferes with its phosphorylation at Ser172.

**Conclusion**:
- The PMF method allows for the comparison of tubulin isoform compositions and documenting changes in PTMs between samples with different tubulin assembly properties or consecutively to modification site mutations or enzyme inactivation.

#### Paramecium Axonemal Tubulin Polyglycylation Analysis via MALDI-TOF MS

**Characterization of Tubulin Isotypes using PMF Method**

**Tubulin C-Terminal PMF**:
- Achieved first biochemical characterization of a4A-tubulin isotype (Redeker et al., 1998)
- Direct MS analysis of complete tubulin C-terminal peptide pools offers possibility for quantitative comparison between glutamylation or glycylation levels
- However, ionization efficiencies and retention times of isotype-defining peptides may differ
- Tyrosinated tubulin peptides give a signal twice higher than nontyrosinated form, so not possible to quantify isotypes using this approach alone
- Additional strategies (e.g., labeled synthetic peptides) needed to address limitations

**Limitations of C-Terminal PMF**:
- Detection of low abundant peptides can be inhibited by ion suppression signal phenomenon
- Underestimation of some tubulin isotypes due to this effect
- To detect low abundant peptides, complexity of peptide mixture needs to be reduced using high-resolution reversed-phase HPLC separation
- Peptides can also be affinity purified using antibodies directed against specific PTMs or isotype-defining peptides for further characterization

**Polyglycylation of Axonemal Tubulins from Paramecium**:
- Identified on axonemal tubulin from Paramecium cilia (Redeker et al., 1994)
- Mass increments of 57 Da observed for glycine residues in MS analysis of isolated fractions
- Up to 34 additional glycine residues detected using high-resolution 2D HPLC separation
- Tubulin C-terminal PMF revealed predominant hexaglycylated a- and b-tubulin isoforms in Paramecium
- Longer polyglycine chains may regulate protein-protein interactions by altering steric hindrance
- Modification sites identified using MS/MS to understand functional role of polyglycylation

#### Tubulin Polyglycylation Structural Characterization in Paramecium

**Structural Characterization of Polyglycylation in Tubulin Isotypes**

**Observations**:
- C-terminal peptides from b-tubulin and short a1/a2-tubulins observed, with differences in theoretical vs. experimental masses corresponding to multiples of 57 Da (mass of one glycine)
- Predominant tubulin peptides are hexaglycylated, with some detecting up to 31 additional glycine residues

**Structural Elucidation**:
- Localization of modification sites within a peptide sequence determined by MS/MS on MALDI-TOF and nanoESI Q-TOF instruments
- Fragmentation rules established for posttranslational polyglycylated peptides, with glycine residues behaving like nonmodified ones
- High-energy collision rules extended to low-energy fragmentation obtained with nanoESI Q-TOF MS
- Polyglycylation identified on last 4 glutamate residues of a single tubulin molecule, independently of total additional glycine residues

**Developmental Changes**:
- Tubulin isotype expression changes between neonatal and adult rat brain:
  - a1A/B-, bI-, bII-, and bIII-tubulins expressed in neonates, while a4A and bIV are expressed later and only detected in adults
- High levels of glutamylation on predominantly nontyrosinated a4A-tubulin observed in adult brains

#### Microtubule Tubulin Polyglutamylation Changes During Neuronal Development

**Neonatal vs Adult Rat Brain Tubulin Isoforms**
- During development, a significant increase in polyglutamylation is observed for b-tubulins:
  - Neonatal bII- and bIII-tubulins have a maximum of two additional glutamates
  - Adult bI-, bII-, bIII-, and bIV-tubulins bear up to three, six, four, and five additional glutamates, respectively
- a-Tubulin polyglutamylation is already abundant in very young neurons but accumulates during differentiation
  - No significant change in glutamylation levels during cell differentiation

**MALDI Mass Spectra Analysis of C-Terminal Peptides from A- and B-Tubulins**
- MALDI mass spectra of the C-terminal peptides of a-tubulins (A and C) and b-tubulins (B and D) show:
  - Presence of additional glutamate residues corresponds to mass increments of 129 Da
  - Glutamylation of b-tubulin is very low in young neurons and accumulates during differentiation
- Difficulty in isolating individual tubulin isoforms as multiple isotypes cannot be easily separated into single protein spots

**Polyglutamylation and Microtubule Stability**
- Changes in glutamylation concomitantly increase microtubule stability
- Polyglutamylation may facilitate MAPs binding, with longer polyglutamyl chains modulating interaction with structural and motor MAPs like Tau, MAP1B, and MAP2
  - Structural analysis of glutamylated peptides is more challenging than for polyglycylated peptides due to the high acidity of glutamate residues and the tendency for glutamate modifications to readily fragment, similar to phosphorylation
- Fragmentation of polyglutamylated peptides can be improved using N-terminal derivatization with TMPP or techniques like electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and electron captured dissociation (ECD)
- Characterizing the lateral glutamate chains remains a challenging question
  - Optimized reversed-phase separation and synthetic peptides mimicking all possible structures of lateral chains for bi- and triglutamylated peptides have been used to study this further

#### Tubulin Glutamylation Analysis of Fish Brain Microtubules

**Tubulin Glutamylation: Role of TTLs**
- **Tubulin Glutamylation**:
    - Initiated by glutamylases that add first glutamate residue to g-carboxyl group of specific glutamate in primary sequence
    - Elongated by addition of subsequent glutamate residues via -carboxyl peptide bonds
- **TTLLs**: Gene family coding for TTLs containing a catalytic domain homologous to TTL but carrying out tubulin glutamylation
    - Reveals common catalytic property in adding an amino acid to a glutamate residue in isotype-defining C-terminal domain
- **TTLL Glutamylases**:
    - Some have predominant chain initiating activity, others present important chain elongating activity
- **Tubulin C-Terminal PMF Method**:
    - Observed increased level of heterogeneity in -tubulins from adult brain
    - Attributed to posttranslational excision of penultimate glutamate residue, generating D2-a-tubulin and making tubulin nontyrosinatable

**Tubulin Glutamylation and Cold Stability of Antarctic Fish Brain Tubulins**
- **Cold Adaptation**:
    - Microtubule assembly from Antarctic fish tubulins is efficient at low temperatures (/C)
    - Mammalian tubulins depolymerize in these conditions
- **Characterization of - and b-Tubulin C-Terminal Peptides**:
    - Revealed differences in tubulin glutamylation between cold-adapted fish brain tubulin and neonatal/adult rat brain tubulins
    - Fish brain a-tubulins are more heterogeneous, with nonglutamylated isoforms being more abundant but maximal side-chain lengths longer than mammalian
    - Number of b-isoforms observed in fish brain is lower and similar to adult fish brain tubulins, with nonglutamylated isoforms being most abundant and shorter glutamyl side-chain length
    - High levels of nontyrosinated a-tubulins further trimmed by elimination of one or two C-terminal glutamate residues
- **Proposed Mechanism**:
    - Changes in tubulin glutamylation could act synergistically with unique residue substitutions in Antarctic fish tubulins to contribute to their cold adaptation

**Modifications Consecutive to Polymodification Site Mutations**
- **Cilia and Flagella**:
    - C-terminal tubulin sequences and polymodifications play important role in proper organization and motility of axonemal structures
- **Tubulin Variants with Multiple Substitutions**:
    - Produced to inactivate glycylation sites by substituting them with aspartate or alanine residues in Tetrahymena thermophilus - and b-tubulins
- **Axonemal Tubulin Composition Analysis**:
    - Revealed differences between Tetrahymena and Paramecium axonemal tubulin, with T. thermophilum being glycylated and highly glutamylated (up to 11 additional glutamates)
    - Suggests either distinct modification sites for each polymodification or lateral chains containing both glutamate and glycine residues
- **Changes in PTMs of Mutants**:
    - bEAAA 440 variant exhibits significant loss of polymodifications, with predominant b-tubulin isoform being monoglycylated instead of tetraglycylated in WT

**Methods for Tubulin PTMs Characterization:**
- MS techniques used in combination with other methods to study tubulin polymerization and modifications include:
  - Tubulin C-terminal peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF)
  - Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of entire tubulins
 
**Tubulin C-terminal Peptide Mass Fingerprinting:**
- Rapidly provides a complete picture of molecular heterogeneity in tubulin isoforms and modifications
- Yields information on:
  - Qualitative expression of isotypes
  - Characterization of PTMs for each isotype
  - Multiple modifications, polymodifications, and modification sites

**Limitations:**
- Cross-talk between tubulin subunits may require fingerprinting of individual isoforms to interpret functional or structural changes following modification site mutations or enzyme inactivation
- Ion suppression phenomenon in MS for low ionization properties or low abundance peptides can be mitigated with high-resolution reversed-phase separations and miniaturized chromatographic methods.

**Importance of Tubulin PTMs:**
- Polyglycylation and polyglutamylation may stabilize the B-subfiber of outer doublets and regulate intraflagellar transport
- Suggests an important role in axonemal microtubule assembly and axonemal motility.

#### Taxol-stabilized Tubulin Purification Method

**Microtubules Purification using Taxol-Based Methods:**
- Microtubules are pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 30 minutes at 37C and stored at -80C.
- Discussion: The method for isolating tubulins using Taxol can be monitored via SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using a pan-alpha-beta tubulin antibody. This method may exclude some forms of tubulin that do not assemble in the presence of high Taxol concentrations.
- Purification of tubulin by cycles of assembly/disassembly excludes tubulin species incorporated into cold-stable microtubules.
- The protocols cannot be used to isolate tubulin for subsequent in vitro assays but are suitable for analyzing the tubulin content in a cell line or tissue that will be used as a source of soluble and functional tubulin.
- Glutamate addition provides favorable conditions for tubulin assembly, removing MAPs and contaminants from microtubule pellets.

**Electrophoretic Separation of Tubulin Isotypes:**
- Electrophoresis is an effective method to separate tubulin isotypes for further analysis.
- A-and b-tubulins have similar molecular weights, so modifications are needed to separate them via SDS-PAGE using a mixture containing SDS and longer chain alkyl sulfates.
- Isoelectric focusing (IEF) can be employed for high-resolution separation of individual tubulin isotypes due to their distinct isoelectric points within the narrow pI range.
- Narrow-range IPG gels and an Ettan IPGphor II system were used for IEF. Gels were stained using Pierce GelCode Blue Stain. Images obtained using a Microtek ScanMaker 9800 XL.

  * Clarify tubulin samples by centrifugation before assembly
  * GTP or GMPCPP induced assembly: incubate at 6.0 mg/ml in MEM buffer for 30 minutes at 37C
    + Add Taxol and discodermolide (or other drugs) to determine drug binding effects
    + For GDP tubulin dimers, prepare by inducing polymerization into microtubules and resuspending in cold buffer containing 1 mM GDP
  * Initiate HDX by diluting samples 20-fold in deuterated MEM buffer at 37C for certain time periods (5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes)
    + Quench exchange aliquots with ammonium phosphate buffer to minimize back exchange during HPLC

- MS/MS may not provide sufficient sequence information for large peptides
- Combination of various enzymatic digestions yields better results
- Molecular pharmacology studies often performed with brain tubulin due to practical reasons but nonneuronal sources are more physiologically and pharmacologically representative.

2. **Curved Conformation**: Bound to cellular depolymerizer RB3 or microtubule-destabilizing ligands (colchicine, podophyllotoxin, or vinblastine)
* Kink between two dimers bound to RB3 fragment
* Indistinguishable kink between monomers within each dimer
* Different tubulin monomer conformation compared to straight protofilament: rotation of intermediate domain with respect to N-terminal domain, displacement along the dimer axis of core helix H7
* Depolymerizing factors may have effects beyond sequestration of GDP state of tubulin

**GDP Tubulin Polymer Stabilization and Cryo-EM Studies:**
- Obtained a structure of low-energy state of GDP-bound tubulin using tight winding of doublespiral where every turn corresponds to slightly open double-layer ring
- Free GDP tubulin protofilament is incompatible with lateral contacts in microtubules due to bending at interfaces (intra- and interdimer)

**Tubulin Conformation: Nucleotide State vs. Lattice Contact vs. Combination of Both:**
- Andreu et al. argued that nucleotide has no effect on tubulin conformation based on FtsZ structure and bacterial tubulin homolog studies
- Hyman et al. showed that GTP-bound tubulin is less curved than its GDP-bound counterpart, suggesting exchange of GDP for GTP results in a change from more kinked to smoothly curved conformation
- Nogales and Wang proposed two-step straightening model: GTP exchange results in smooth curvature that allows association of protofilaments into assembly intermediates with lateral contacts, leading to final straightening.

#### Structural Studies of Microtubule Interactions and Kinetochore Formation in Budding Yeast

**Microtubules: Kinetochore Interactions and Dam1 Complex**

**Role of Microtubules in Cell Division:**
- Essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis
- Stores energy for movement through depolymerization

**Kinetochore Function:**
- Network of protein complexes on centromeric chromatin
- Connects chromosomes to microtubules
- Ensures accurate chromosome distribution to daughter cells

**Dam1 Complex:**
- Involved in mitotic spindle function for budding yeast
- Consists of ten subunits (Dam1, Duo1p, and others)
- Essential for regulated microtubule kinetochore attachment
- Interacts with checkpoint kinase Ipl1

**Microtubule-Dam1 Complex Interactions:**
- Dam1 complex assembles into rings and spirals on microtubules (Miranda et al., 2005; Westermann et al., 2005)
- Ring structure allows processive movement following depolymerizing ends (Westermann et al., 2006)
- Energy for processive movement comes from conformational change in tubulin during microtubule disassembly

**Structural Studies:**
- Dam1 complex assembly visualized through electron microscopy
- Ring structure enables efficient energy transfer and tracking of depolymerizing ends (Fig. 2, right panel)

**Proposed Structure of Microtubule Disassembly Intermediate: GDP Tubulin**
- Curved protofilament peels at end of shortening microtubules is a structural intermediate in disassembly process
- High concentrations of divalent cations form stable tubular assemblies without need for depolymerizers (Fig. 3, left)
- Recapitulates shape of horn-like protofilament structures at depolymerizing microtubule ends.

#### GDP-Bound Tubulin Cryo-EM Structure and Its Interdimer Interactions

**Cryo-EM Studies of Microtubule Structural Intermediates and Kinetochore Microtubule Interactions**

**Helical Reconstruction of GDP Tubulin Assemblies**:
- Cryo-EM analysis of well-ordered GDP tubulin assemblies provided the first structural characterization of an unconstrained tubulin polymer in the absence of depolymerizing factors or drugs.
- Helical reconstruction allowed for the description of protofilament structure, revealing distinctive intra- and interdimer interactions.
- The two interfaces (GTP and GDP) have distinct bending angles and flexibilities.

**RB3-Bound Tubulin Structure**:
- RB3-bound tubulin showed a small rearrangement at the intradimer interface, possibly due to the presence of colchicine.
- The interdimer interface may get locked into an intradimer-like state by the RB3 alpha helix.
- EM and X-ray studies indicated that the bending angles of the intra- and interdimer interfaces are incompatible with microtubule lateral contacts.

**GTP Tubulin Assembly Intermediate**:
- **Polymerization Interference by GMPCPP**:
  - At low temperatures, GTP tubulin forms small oligomers that appear slightly curved.
  - Increasing magnesium concentration stabilizes these oligomers and leads to the formation of ring-like structures, especially with GDP.
  - The presence of non-hydrolyzable GMPCPP allows for the study of a new polymer form with laterally associated, slightly curved protofilaments.
- **Proposed Mechanism**:
  - At low temperatures, slow tubulin interactions prevent microtubule closure and hydrolysis, allowing the GTP tubulin (GMPCPP) to continue polymerizing.
  - This stabilized assembly form may correspond to a GTP-specific intermediate in microtubule growth.

**Dam1 Complex Self-Assembly**:
- The architecture of the Dam1 complex and its microtubule-driven self-assembly are essential for understanding its role in regulating chromosome attachment and segregation during mitosis.
- Two assembly forms have been observed: a closed ring structure and a double spiral with each turn corresponding to a slightly opened ring.
- The physiological oligomeric form is likely the closed ring based on the number of Dam1 copies estimated from in vivo fluorescence studies.

#### Cryo-EM Analysis of GDP Tubulin Helical Tubes and Reconstruction

**Cryo-EM Studies of Microtubule Structural Intermediates and Kinetochore Microtubule Interactions**

#### Fourier Bessel Alignment of Double-Layered Tubes for Structural Analysis

**Double-Layer Microtubule Reconstruction**

**Overview**:
- Systematic overlap of Bessel terms from inner and outer layers on layer lines makes traditional helical reconstruction methods impossible
- Iterative Fourier Bessel method developed to determine relative orientation of tube images and produce 3D reconstructions

**Data Preprocessing**:
- Tube image is cut from original micrograph into a box about four times wider than the tube itself
- In-plane curvature corrected using straightening algorithm in Phoelix package
- Images are cut into three parts: tube, ice on one side, and averaged ice on the other for background estimation
- Power spectrum of each tube is analyzed to extract layer lines up to a resolution of 8 nm
- Layer lines reassigned to a common selection rule from average of all tubes

**Alignment and Averaging**:
- Tubes with out-of-plane tilt > 5 degrees discarded
- Alignment cycle uses half-weighted focal pairs for datamerging and averaging
- Equator not used in alignment process
- Radial scale refined during alignment
- Iterative Fourier Bessel alignment algorithm leads to stable solution after a dozen iterations
- Set of inner-layer and outer-layer alignment parameters used for final averaging
- Contrast transfer function (CTF) corrected during averaging

**Final Reconstruction**:
- Obtained reconstructions of both layers up to a resolution of 10 nm (one turn of the outer-layer reconstruction shown in Fig. 1, bottom left panel)
- Atomic models of tubulin obtained from electron crystallography and X-ray crystallography used for docking experiments into 3D reconstructions
- Manually fitted atomic models converted to density maps, low-pass filtered to 23 nm, and threshold filtered to masks
- Densities compared by Fourier shell correlation, indicating they are practically indistinguishable within a resolution of 15 nm
- Helical symmetries applied to docked atomic models to generate longer protofilament model using HLXBUILD program in Situs

#### Cryo-EM Analysis of GMPCPP Tubulin Helical Structures

**GMPCPP Tubulin Helical Ribbons and Tubes**

**Summary**:
- Helical ribbons and tubes of GMPCPP-bound tubulin are obtained by incubating tubulin with this nucleotide at low temperatures (4-15C) for several hours (up to 4 h) in the presence of high concentration of magnesium ions (830 mM)
- Frozen-hydrated helical tubes can then be imaged by cryo-EM
- Images of two tubes corresponding to the same helical family were analyzed using traditional helical methods to obtain a reconstruction at 18 nm resolution

**Cryo-EM Studies of Microtubule Structural Intermediates and Kinetochore Microtubule Interactions**

**Generating GMPCPP Tubulin Ribbons and Tubes**:
- The slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue guanylyl-(ab)-methylene-diphosphonate (GMPCPP) was used to bind tubulin
- To obtain GMPCPP-bound tubulin:
  - Bovine brain tubulin is incubated at 37C for 30 min in CBII buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM GTP to form microtubules
  - Microtubules are pelleted, resuspended in cold CBI buffer, and allowed to depolymerize in ice for 20 min
  - The solution is then centrifuged at 4C to remove insoluble aggregates
  - GMPCPP is added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the solution is incubated for 10 min on ice
  - The GMPCPP tubulin is diluted to 2-3 mg/ml in CBI buffer with MgCl2 ranging from 4 to 30 mM
  - The solution is incubated at different temperatures: 4C, 15C, 25C, and 37C
    - At 4C, GMPCPP tubulin self-assembles slowly into helical ribbons at magnesium concentrations higher than 8 mM
    - When MgCl2 is as high as 20 mM, spiral ribbons are observed after just 30 min of incubation
    - At higher temperatures (but lower than 20C), formation of spirals is faster
    - For incubation times longer than a couple of hours, more abundant and fast-growing ribbons assemble into well-ordered helical tubular crystals of GMPCPP tubulin
    - At concentrations of MgCl2 lower than 6 mM, the assemblies become rare
    - When incubation temperature is higher than 20C, GMPCPP tubulin forms mainly microtubules, with more helical ribbons coexisting at high MgCl2 (20 mM)
- The most parsimonious explanation for how divalent cations promote tubulin self-assembly is the shielding of the negative charges in tubulin C-terminal tails by ions, facilitating the coming together of tubulin subunits

**Overall Morphology of Ribbons and Tubes**:
- Spiral ribbons and tubes can have various diameters
- Curvature of protofilaments is invariant - the longitudinal bends between tubulin subunits are well-defined and do not change as the assemblies grow
- Spiral ribbons are composed of parallel, paired tubulin protofilaments
- Pairing is a strong tendency for protofilaments under these assembly conditions
- Even in early stages, small oligomers of about 5-8 dimers interact laterally and robustly in a paired fashion

**Reconstruction of GMPCPP Tubulin Tubes and Model Building**:
- Samples of GMPCPP tubulin tubes were vitrified and imaged by cryo-EM
- The final average reconstruction resulted in a model with a resolution of 18 nm

**Direct Conversion of GMPCPP Tubulin Tubes into Microtubules**:
- After the formation of GMPCPP tubulin ribbons at 15C, increasing the temperature to 37C resulted in the conversion of the tubes to microtubules
- Fluorescence microscopy was used to prove that this conversion was direct, without involving a depolymerization step

---

#### Cryo-EM Reconstruction of Dam1 Complex around Microtubules

**Three-Dimensional Cryo-Electron Microscopy Reconstruction**

**GMPCPP Tube Samples**:
- Pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 10 minutes below room temperature and washed once with CBI buffer containing 15 mM magnesium
- Resuspended in CBI buffer with 15 mM magnesium and incubated at 37C for over 3 hours to ensure conversion of helical ribbons and tubes into microtubules
- Diluted, fixed, and viewed by fluorescence microscopy using a 60 C2Nikon objective on a Nikon Eclipse fluorescence microscope

**Fluorescence Microscopy**:
- Viewing area examined using two different filters to record the patterns of fluorescein-tubulin (green) and rhodamine-tubulin (red)
- Merged images showed no overlap, indicating the GMPCPP tubes had not depolymerized to dimers or small oligomers before microtubule formation
- As a control, the two fluorescent tubulins were mixed before assembly and incubated at 37C in the presence of GMPCPP to form microtubules
- Control images showed perfect overlap, as expected from random mixing of tubulin dimers with the two labels

**Microtubule Dam1 Kinetochore Complex Assemblies**:

**Summary**:
- In the presence of microtubules, the yeast kinetochore Dam1 complex assembles into rings or helical spirals around microtubules
- EM analysis of the ring revealed it to consist of 16 Dam1 complexes
- Segments of well-ordered doublespirals of Dam1 helical assemblies were studied by cryo-EM and helical reconstruction methods to provide a 3D structure at a resolution of 30 
- A new algorithm has been developed to deal with the disorder and symmetry heterogeneity of this sample, opening new possibilities in characterizing the Dam1 complex

**Preparing Ring and Spiral Assembly of Dam1 Around Microtubules**:
- Dam1 complex binds more readily to GMPCPP microtubules made from GMPCPP-bound tubulin
- Dam1 complex diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in CBI buffer with 2 mg/ml GMPCPP microtubules at room temperature for 10 minutes
- Samples negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate and examined by EM revealed rings around the microtubules
- Analysis of end-on views showed a 16-fold rotational symmetry of the rings
- For helical spiral formation, Dam1 complex was dialyzed against a low-salt buffer before addition

**Cryo-EM and Helical Reconstruction of the Dam1 Spiral Assembly Around Microtubules**:
- Frozen-hydrated samples transferred to a cryo-holder cooled by liquid nitrogen and examined on a Philips CM200 or Tecnai F20 microscope
- Segments of Dam1-wrapped microtubules showing tight order were used for helical reconstruction
- Out of hundreds of segments, two showed clear helical diffraction to resolution better than 40 
- The axial repeats of the microtubule and the Dam1 complex spirals were not a multiple of each other, requiring parallel, independent reconstructions

#### Cryo-EM Analysis of Dam1 Complex Structures Around Microtubules

**Analysis of Two Dam1 Ring Segments Using SUPRIM and Home-Modified MRC Software**
* Identified two Dam1 ring segments with 15-fold and 16-fold spirals around a 14-protofilament and 16-protofilament microtubule, respectively.
* Each particle processed independently, showed clear two-fold symmetry with axis perpendicular to helical axis.
* Choosing the same two-fold axis for both data sets resulted in pairs of corresponding peaks being close to 0 or 180 degrees.
* After out-of-plane tilt correction and origin alignment, merged layer lines from the four sides were analyzed below first zero of CTF.
* Most densities were within radii 150-350 nm indicating radial separation of Dam1 complex density from microtubule density.
* Two-fold symmetry applied on merged layer lines resulted in a 3D map of the Dam1 complex spiral around a 16-protofilament microtubule.

**New Image Analysis Methodology Development**
* At saturating concentrations, Dam1 forms tightly packed spirals with each turn closely matching lock-washer rings.
* Conventional helical reconstruction methods struggle to analyze these Dam1 spirals due to lack of long-range helical order and extreme layer line broadening.
* Single-particle helical reconstruction approach developed by Egelman could potentially overcome limitations but requires modifications for symmetry mismatch between Dam1 and microtubule assemblies.
* New approach (Ramey et al., 2009) uses single-particle analysis, removing microtubules from short segments, then applies image alignment and classification techniques to determine helical parameters.
* Yielded a 30 nm reconstruction of Dam1 complex in good agreement with previous traditional Fourier Bessel method results.
* Method has general applicability for studying other microtubule-associated proteins that assemble around microtubules.

#### Microtubule Depolymerization and Dam1 Complex Interactions

**Single-Particle Approach in Dam1 Spirals Analysis**
- Overview of approach:
    - Helical segments boxed and preprocessed to remove microtubule
    - Segments aligned and classified for reduced heterogeneity
    - 2D averages used for symmetry estimation, creating initial model for refinement by single-particle methods

**Microtubule Formation from Structural Intermediates**
- Proposed that Dam1 ribbon structures can directly convert to microtubules without breaking down into individual subunits
    - Ribbon structure has protofilament arrangement explaining sheet structure of Chretien et al. (2006)
    - Conversion involves rolling lateral interface over highly conserved region on protofilament surface
- GDP tubulin tube: structural intermediate during microtubule disassembly
    - Energy released from GTP hydrolysis becomes constrained lattice energy in the microtubule body
    - Drives microtubule depolymerization, generating force for work (Janosi et al., 2002; Molodtsov et al., 2005)

**Dam1 Ring Complex and Microtubule Ends**
- Flexible electrostatic interaction between Dam1 ring and microtubule lattice suggests stochastic switching to different E-hooks
    - Implications for kinetochore function: robust connection with highly processive, mobile attachment
- Disagreement on whether Dam1 complexes use biased diffusion or forced walk mechanism for function (Grishchuk et al., 2008; Westermann et al., 2006)
    - Studies using nonencircling oligomers and single complexes suggest that a ring may not be necessary for function (Gestaut et al., 2008; Grishchuk et al., 2008)
- Dam1 complexes number at budding kinetochore: 16-20, agreement with number seen in single ring (Joglekar et al., 2006)
- Experiments using Dam1-coated beads showed that complex can follow both growing and shrinking microtubule ends, forming a ring that interacts with peels at end of depolymerizing microtubules.
    - Ring transmits tension to peels, stabilizing microtubule against depolymerization direction (Asbury et al., 2006)

#### Characterizing Dam1 Oligomerization and Microtubule Interactions in Yeast Kinetochore Complexes

**Dam1 Microtubule Affinity and Oligomerization State**
- Davis et al. developed a fluorescence-based assay to measure Dam1 microtubule affinity with high sensitivity at extremely low concentrations of tubulin (Gestaut et al., 2008)
- Reported values 30-fold greater than previously described in the nanomolar range
- Single-molecule experiments showed that at low concentrations of Dam1, short oligomers of 14 copies can follow both assembling and disassembling microtubule ends, although with reduced processivity

**Cryo-EM Studies of Microtubule Structural Intermediates and Kinetochore Microtubule Interactions**
- Issue of Dam1 oligomerization state and its relevance further analyzed by McIntosh et al. (Grishchuk et al., 2008)
- Proposed that Dam1 ring oligomers are unable to diffuse but can track depolymerizing ends
- Smaller oligomers diffuse with rates inversely proportional to their sizes
- Single rings able to track microtubule ends, but larger assemblies not
- Presence of one tracking ring reduces depolymerization rate, encountering a second results in halting until one disassembles
- Dam1-coated beads show two distinct behaviors depending on availability of soluble Dam1 complexes:
  - Without soluble Dam1: beads bind only to GMPCPP section and increase depolymerization rate with increasing Dam1 decoration, track ends by rolling rather than sliding
  - With soluble Dam1: beads bind along microtubule length and reduce depolymerization rate, form complexes with soluble Dam1
- Phosphomimetic mutants impaired for ring formation but able to track depolymerizing ends in vitro are deleterious in vivo, suggesting smaller oligomers are deficient in a cellular context.

### Chapter 9: High Resolution Imaging of Microtubules and Cytoskeleton Structures by Atomic Force Microscopy

**High-Resolution Imaging of Microtubules and Cytoskeleton Structures by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)**

**I. Introduction to AFM Imaging of Biomolecules**
- AFM is a nanometer-scale resolution microscope that can image biomolecular interactions in liquid environments
- Advantages over other techniques like electron microscopy: three-dimensional imaging, near native conditions, real-time tracking
- Focus on nucleic acids, especially DNA and RNA, but fewer studies on cytoskeleton structures, particularly microtubules

**II. Rationale**
- AFM principle and operating modes in air or liquid
- Substrates and surface treatments for microtubule imaging
+ Mica is a popular substrate for biomolecules, suitable for microtubule imaging
+ Buffer composition plays a role in adsorption of biomolecules on mica
- Characteristics of microtubule imaging by AFM: significant height, fragile structure, surface influence
- Useful applications: control of tubulin functionality, observation of microtubules in interaction with partners

**III. AFM Principle and Operation Mode**
- **AFM principle**: scanning probe microscope that measures forces between a sharp tip and a sample surface
- **Modes of operation**: contact mode, intermittent contact mode, tapping mode
+ Contact mode: constant force between tip and sample
+ Intermittent contact mode: short contact periods to reduce damage
+ Tapping mode: oscillating tip reduces friction and improves resolution

**IV. Practical Aspects of Microtubules Adsorption on Surface and AFM Imaging**
- **Material for AFM imaging**: choice of substrate, cleaning and preparation, coating with protein or other materials if needed
- **Material and methods for microtubule assembly**: methods to assemble microtubules in solution, such as using taxol or glutaraldehyde stabilization
- **Substrate for microtubule imaging**: mica is a popular choice due to its smooth surface and ability to interact with multivalent counterions
- **Buffer conditions for microtubule adsorption on mica**: specific buffer composition required for adsorption of biomolecules on mica

**V. AFM Imaging in Air of Microtubules**
- **Control of the tubulin purity**: important to ensure high-quality microtubules for imaging
- **Evidence of microtubule structural changes**: observed in AFM images of microtubules in air without stabilizing agents

#### Atomic Force Microscopy Principles and Biomolecule Imaging

**AFM Imaging Technique**

**Principle of AFM:**
- Uses a sharp tip (nanometer scale) mounted on a flexible cantilever
- Scanning tip over sample surface controlled by piezoelectric ceramic
- Interaction forces between tip and sample detected with angstrom resolution
- Images generated from recorded deflection angles

**AFM Operating Modes:**
- Contact mode: tip touches sample, fixed during XY scan
  * Not suitable for biomolecule imaging due to high lateral forces and potential deformation
- Noncontact mode: long-range attraction force used for scanning without contact
  * Unsuitable for biological samples under normal atmospheric pressure
- Intermittent-contact mode: oscillating tip touches surface intermittently, adjusting Z position for constant amplitude
  * Less aggressive than contact mode and suitable for improving resolution of biological sample images

**AFM Imaging in Liquid vs. Air:**
- **Liquid cell**: advantages include near physiological conditions and absence of capillary forces
  * Challenges: adsorption of biomolecules on surface, tip dragging if not firmly attached, long image acquisition times
- **Air imaging**: less demanding than liquid, can provide higher resolution due to fixed molecules on surface after drying.

**AFM Imaging Process:**
1. Sample preparation: biomolecules interact in solution and a small volume is deposited on mica or other suitable substrate
2. Incubation for few minutes to allow diffusion and spreading
3. Rinsing with purified water to remove buffer components and avoid salt crystallization
4. Fixation of biomolecules using fixation buffer like 0.02% w/v uranyl acetate to prevent release during rinsing.

#### Microtubule Assembly and AFM Imaging on Mica Surface

**Microtubules Adsorption on Surface and AFM Imaging**

**A. Materials for AFM Imaging:**
- Multimode Tapping Mode Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) from Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA
- Olympus silicon cantilever AC160TS with nominal spring constants of 9 N/m to 75 N/m and resonant frequency of about 300 kHz
- High-resolution imaging between 36 and 75 N/m

**B. Materials and Methods for Microtubule Assembly:**
- Tubulin purified from sheep brain as previously described (Castoldi and Popov, 2003)
- Thawed tubulin stock undergoes an additional polymerization cycle in polymerization buffer: 50 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.8, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol
- Incubation at desired concentrations (from 20 to 40 mM) in polymerization buffer for 10 minutes on ice
- Addition of 1 mM GTP and transfer to 37C for 15 minutes

**C. Substrate for Microtubule Imaging:**
- Glass, mica, gold, and silicon surfaces have been used for noncovalent or covalent immobilization of biomolecules
- Most popular substrate is muscovite mica due to its highly negative charge
- Weak electrostatic attachment to mica obtained by adding multivalent cations (e.g., Mg2+) in the buffer
- Adsorption strength can be modulated by varying the concentration of multivalent cations
- Other methods for microtubule adsorption include chemical modifications of mineral substrates or amino-derivatized substrates, but these may affect resolution due to softness and roughness

**D. Buffer Conditions for Microtubule Adsorption on Mica:**
- Multivalent cations compensate for the effect of monovalent salts that cannot contribute to attraction force between biomolecule and mica surface
- Presence of 5 mM MgCl2 in polymerization buffer is sufficient for microtubule adsorption on freshly cleaved mica

**E. Protocol for Microtubule Imaging in Air:**
- After microtubule assembly, a 10 mL aliquot is deposited on mica and incubated for 20 seconds to allow diffusion and adsorption
- Mica surface plunged into uranyl acetate solution (0.02% w/v) for fixation
- Sample rinsed with pure water and dried
- Scan rate of tip varies between 1.5 and 2 Hz per line depending on scan area
- High concentration of biological material can preclude high-resolution imaging, but microtubules require a high concentration of building blocks to assemble above the critical concentration (Cc). Possible solutions: dilution after assembly or decreasing incubation time. However, these methods may not represent native conformation or composition of sample. Therefore, preferred method is to deposit sample without any dilution during a sufficiently long time to allow adsorption of majority of microtubules.

#### Imaging Microtubules in Liquid with AFM

**High-Resolution Imaging of Microtubules and Cytoskeleton Structures**

**Protocol for Microtubule Imaging in Liquid AFM**:
- Requires a higher sample volume (200 L) and more microtubules
- Tubulin is assembled in polymerization buffer containing 20 mM taxol for microtubule stabilization
- Microtubules are then pelleted at 25,000 g/cm^2 for 10 minutes at 37C to remove non-polymerized tubulin
- Supernatant is discarded and the pellet is gently resuspended in polymerization buffer containing 10 mM taxol and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes to prevent microtubule opening
- Microtubule-stabilized sample (20 L) is deposited on mica surface and placed in the liquid cell
- The liquid cell is then filled with 100 L of buffer (50 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.8, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2)
- Unpolymerized tubulin should be removed by centrifugation before microtubule adsorption on mica to avoid altering the image quality and affecting imaging conditions

**Imaging Conditions**:
- AFM imaging in liquid can have faster scan rates (6-10 Hz per line) due to the lower quality factor of the vibrating cantilever in liquid compared to air
- 30 seconds to 2 minutes per frame is sufficient for image acquisition of a 10/11. L 10. L 10. M 10. M 10. M Fig. 2 The collapse of microtubules on the mica surface due to drying, even when stabilized with taxol or glutaraldehyde, is problematic for functional studies as it prevents observation of dynamic behavior.

#### High-Resolution AFM Imaging of Microtubule Assembly and Interactions

**AFM Imaging in Air of Microtubule Structures**

**AFM as a Quality Control Tool for Tubulin Purity**:
- AFM allows imaging microtubules without using large quantities of biological material (10 g of tubulin)
- Large-scale images can detect the presence of small or large aggregates, reflecting the purity of the sample
- Light scattering measurements cannot discriminate different families of polymers/aggregates in the sample
- AFM imaging of an aliquot after polymerization documents different structures in a few minutes

**AFM Imaging of Microtubule Structural Changes**:
- **Polyamines**: Small cationic molecules that can promote microtubule nucleation and elongation via facilitated diffusion
- Presence of polyamine (spermine) in the polymerization buffer leads to a higher plateau value, as observed by AFM imaging
- AFM reveals the formation of microtubule bundles, attributed to an electrostatic interaction between tubulin C-terminal domains and the tetravalent cations

**AFM Imaging of Intermediate Structures**:
- Microtubules elongate very quickly (10 m/min), which is not compatible with AFM's long acquisition times
- AFM in air can provide information on intermediate structures during microtubule assembly
- By deposing aliquots of tubulin sample at short time intervals after warming, AFM users can detect different populations of intermediate structures and analyze the successive steps of assembly

**AFM Imaging of Tubulin/Microtubule:Protein Interactions**:
- Free tubulin and microtubules interact with various proteins (microtubule-associated proteins, molecular motor proteins) and drugs (taxol, vinblastine, colchicine)
- High-resolution AFM images can provide information on the localization of these partners along the microtubule wall and their impact on the microtubule structure

---

#### High-resolution AFM imaging of microtubuleprotein interactions and RNP binding

**AFM Imaging of Microtubule Interactions**

**YB-1 Protein Interaction with Tubulin/Microtubules:**
- YB-1 protein interacts with tubulin and microtubules, promoting assembly
- AFM used to detect height differences between complexes: 8nm (YB-1 & tubulin) vs 0.7nm (YB-1 alone) or 4nm (tubulin alone)
- Height differences easily detected due to AFM's high resolution
- Presence of YB-1 during microtubule assembly promotes formation and reduces Cc, leaving morphology unaltered
- Taxol stabilization and centrifugation necessary to avoid large complexes or aggregates of free tubulin
- Intermediary structures like tubulin rings are of great interest for deciphering partner role in microtubule assembly

**Binding of mRNA to Microtubules Mediated by YB-1:**
- YB-1 interacts with both nucleic acids and microtubules
- AFM used to study RNPs (mRNPs) interaction with microtubules
- In presence of sufficient YB-1, mRNPs colocalize with microtubules and cluster on their walls
- Higher clusters observed as proportion of YB-1 increases
- No interaction between anionic mRNA and microtubules in absence of YB-1.

**Conclusion:**
- AFM is a powerful tool for studying biomolecules or microtubules' interactions with partners
- Allows visualization at single microtubule level using only few micrograms of tubulin per sample
- Provides insights into macromolecular assemblies on microtubules when various partners can be distinguished.

### Chapter 10: Using Computational Modeling to Understand Microtubule Dynamics A Primer for Cell Biologists

**Using Computational Modeling to Understand Microtubule Dynamics: A Primer for Cell Biologists**

**Introduction**:
- Experimental approaches have limitations in understanding microtubule behavior and mechanism
- Mathematical and computational modeling can provide insights into microtubule dynamics
- This chapter provides an introduction to modeling types and their applications

**Mathematical and Computational Modeling: A Primer**:
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Researcher uses equations or sets of linked equations to predict system behavior
- **Computational Modeling**: Subset of mathematical modeling that uses computers to simulate the behavior of a system
- Most cell biologists have used these approaches without realizing it

**Deterministic Models vs. Stochastic Models**:
- **Deterministic Models**: Predict specific outcomes given initial conditions

#### Modeling Biological Systems Understanding Teaching and Prediction

**Convergence between Statistical Mechanics and Classical Thermodynamics**
- Observation of convergence between conclusions from statistical mechanics and classical thermodynamics is strong evidence that understanding is becoming deeper
- Example: Actin polymerization in cell migration simulation
  - Reasonable starting point for level of detail: actin monomer as unit
  - Additional details may require more computational power but are irrelevant
  - Insufficient detail can give misleading results
- Multiple models at different scales can be powerful in understanding a system

**Appropriate Level of Detail in Models**
- Determine appropriate scale based on conceptual model and units
- Considerations:
  - More detail requires more computational power
  - Insufficient detail can result in misleading results
- Explicitly state assumptions, even if mathematically or computationally expedient
  - Biologically justifiable assumptions are necessary for model utility and validity conclusions

**Use of Models to Understand Microtubule Dynamics**
- Test present understanding by building a model based on existing knowledge
  * If observed behavior is not reproduced, either there's a mistake in the model or current understanding is wrong
  - Can be used to tune understanding and direct experiment
- Useful teaching tool for gaining intuitive understanding of complex systems
  - Computational models allow quick observation of results that would be impractical or impossible in real life
- Predict behavior in biotechnological, engineering, or medical contexts once sufficiently well-verified

**Types of Models in Cell Biology**
- Two basic classes: quantitative replication and prediction (simulates reality) and proof of principle models
  * Complete description rarely exists for biological systems more complex than protein ligand interactions
    * Incomplete models can still have practical utility as long as researchers are mindful of assumptions and limitations.

#### Exploring Microtubule Dynamics with Stochastic Modeling

**Computational Modeling of Microtubule Dynamics**

**Approach**: Researcher uses data to limit possible values for parameters and computer exploration to find best fit
- Example: Odde (1997), VanBuren et al. (2002)
- Challenges: Too many unknowns, results may predict ranges instead of specific values
- Important to differentiate arbitrary from strongly predicted parameter values
- Testing multiple parameter sets to assess robustness

**Determining Right Level of Detail**: Simple vs detailed models
- Coarsening simulation vs adding complexity
  - Faster but less appropriate for investigations of mechanism
  - Slower but more appropriate for studying specific phenomena

**Examples of Stochastic Modeling Classes**:
- **Class 1 Models**: Filament level, behavior imposed by modeler
  - Useful for investigating function of microtubule dynamics (Holy and Leibler, 1994; Glicksman et al., 1993)
- **Class 2 Models**: Mechanism investigation, dynamic instability parameters evolve from other events in the model
  - Differ in detail level and rules governing assembly
  - Some models assume 5-start helix or linear protofilament structure, others assume GTP hydrolysis is stochastic or tightly coupled to assembly.

**Conclusion**: Proof-of-principle models show that given mechanisms could lead to dynamic instability behavior. Experimentalists must decide which model best reflects reality based on available evidence and research needs.

#### Exploring Microtubule Dynamics Class 2 vs Class 3 Models and their Implications

**Investigating Microtubule Dynamics: Modeling Approach**

**Approach 1:**
- Investigate inconsistencies with data in models' assumptions
  * Examine if a model has nonphysiological helical interactions between tubulin subunits (Chen and Hill, 1985)
  - Limitations: models with incorrect assumptions may still be useful for certain contexts but cannot provide comprehensive information on stabilizing cap or dynamic instability mechanism

**Approach 2:**
- Evaluate plausibility of mechanisms and fit to experimental data
  * Important distinction between known and unknown parameters
    + More free parameters make it easier to fit a model to data
  * Reproduce results across various conditions for convincing evidence of relevance
  * Observation that inconsistent models may explain existing data equally well indicates the need for more data and collaboration between modelers and experimentalists

**Class 3 Models:**
- Simulates a class 2 system with competition among microtubules for common pool of tubulin
  * Allows investigation into effects on individual microtubules based on system characteristics (number of microtubules, presence of constraints)
  * Differences from Class 2 models: evolving free tubulin concentration versus locked value
    + Dramatically different behavior regarding mass increase over time and steady state reach
  * Importance for understanding microtubule behavior when free tubulin changes with time or environment.

**Class 3 Models vs Class 2:**
- Both needed to investigate microtubule dynamics fully
  * Class 2: comparison to experimental situations with known free tubulin concentration (in vitro early pre-steady state)
  * Class 3: investigation of situations where free tubulin changes with time or environment.

**Challenges in Class 3 Models:**
- Computationally intensive due to simulation of many detailed microtubules in parallel.

**MT Length Changes:**
- Analyze length changes and growth rates for each time interval
- Investigate variance to understand unconventional polymer growth theory
- Repeat analysis for multiple values of time scale or apply algorithm for varying intervals
- Detect repeated displacement events using pairwise-distance distribution function

**Detection Limits:**
- Critical to understand forces acting on bead: trap, linkage, viscous, thermal
- Theoretical spatial resolution improves with decreasing compliance, drag coefficient, and filter cutoff frequency
- Resolution may also improve with smaller beads or higher applied force (assuming strain hardening in bead MT linkage)

#### High-resolution microtubule polymerization assay with potential sources of artifacts

**Assay for Studying MT Polymerization Dynamics with High Spatiotemporal Resolution**
- Describes a technique for studying MT polymerization dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution and interpreting the data.
- Promises to yield insights into MT polymerization dynamics and their modulation by MAPs and MT drugs.

**Assay Considerations**:
- **High bandwidth**: Facilitates stationary-trap or force-clamp data analysis, but may require filtering for spatial resolution and lower temporal resolution.
- **Temporal resolution**: Determined by detector bandwidth or filter cutoff. Events not resolved in time will be detected with a delay or missed.
- **Control MT experiment**: Should be performed using a GMP-CPP-stabilized MT without free tubulin to assess detection limits and potential artifacts.

**Potential Artifacts**:
- **MT sticking**: Can be verified by pulling the MT away from the barrier wall after each experiment.
- **Nucleation**: Substantial nucleation may occur, causing a rapid decrease in free tubulin concentration. Nucleation is sensitive to free tubulin concentration and stimulated by certain factors like g-tubulin or taxol.
- **MT ends**: Other MT ends not under investigation can cause artifacts, such as the opposing end striking a different wall or an out-of-plane MT hitting the barrier. Data should be inspected for signs of these events.
- **Drift**: Barrier movement due to stage drift may result in underestimation or overestimation of MT growth rates. Depending on the tweezers design, drift in the z-direction may affect trap stiffness and sensitivity. It can also change the bead detection system zero position and introduce error.
- **Barrier shape**: Small details in the barrier shape may cause artifacts. These can be addressed or avoided through proper barrier design.

- Used to study microtubule growth or shrinkage, and the mechanism of MAPs on microtubules (Brouhard et al., 2008; Helenius et al., 2006; Varga et al., 2006, 2009)
- Fluorescent microtubules immobilized onto glass surfaces using antibodies and fluorescent MAPs or tubulin
- Observation of single molecules on the microtubule through localization
- TIRF illumination allows for a thin layer (/C24100 nm) above the glass surface to be exclusively illuminated, resulting in visualization of single fluorescent molecules and reduced background signal

**TIRF Theory**
- Fluorescent molecules excited using an evanescent field generated by total internal reflection (Axelrod et al., 1984)
- Intensity decays exponentially with distance (z) perpendicular to the glass surface and into the lower refractive index aqueous solution, called the penetration depth or decay length (d), which depends on wavelength, refractive indices, and angle of incidence

**Two-Color TIRF Implementation**
- Achieved in a through-the-objective-based configuration (Axelrod et al., 1984; Conibear and Bagshaw, 2000; Gell et al., 2006)
- Laser beam focused onto the back focal plane of a high numerical aperture microscope objective
- Narrow collimated beam impinges on the coverglass/solution surface at an adjustable angle to create evanescent field for TIRF illumination.

#### Dual-Color TIRF Microscopy Setup and Reagents for Studying Microtubules

**Dynamic Microtubule Assays Using TIRF**

**Microscope Components and Setup**:
- Two lasers: one at 491 nm and one at 561 nm (Cobolt Calypso and Jive)
- Laser beams collimated and focused using a dual-band polychroic mirror
- Emitted fluorescence collected by the same microscope objective and directed to an electron multiplying CCD camera
- Beam splitter in front of the camera for simultaneous dual-color imaging

**TIRF Microscope Practical Tips**:

#### Fluorescent Labeling Strategies for Dynamic Microtubule Assays

**Microtubule Assays: Fluorophore/Protein Labeling**
* Successful experiments depend on fluorophore choice, experimental approach, and available instrumentation
* Considerations for labeling strategies and dyes (Gell et al., 2006; Hunter et al., 2003; Hyman et al., 1991; Selvin and Ha, 2007)

**A. Common Labeling Strategies:**
* Chemical posttranslational dye labeling: amine or thiol-reactive dyes used for covalent binding to primary amines, N-terminus, or cysteine groups of expressed proteins. Pros: Protein expressed once for multiple labeling reactions; Cons: Harsh conditions; unspecific and unknown labeling site; potential for multiple sites labeled in an uncontrolled manner; requires optimization per biomolecule. Successfully used for tubulin (Hyman et al., 1991) and kinesin-1 (Mori et al., 2007).
* Fusions with intrinsically fluorescent proteins: Make a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein (GFP) or its variants and the gene of interest. Pros: Excellent specificity; control over number of labels; defined stoichiometry; wide spectrum availability; Cons: Time-consuming genetic modification; repeated if different colors required; potential for overexpression failure; photo-physical properties not ideal (Dickson et al., 1997); may alter protein activity. Successfully used to label various MAPs (Brouhard et al., 2008; Helenius et al., 2006; Varga et al., 2006).
* Fusions with SNAP-tag or similar systems: A small enzymatic protein expressed as a fusion with the protein to be labeled, whose substrate carries the dye that becomes covalently attached to the SNAP-tag. Pros: Specific labeling; proteins can be singly labeled or unlabeled; ready-to-use labeling substrates available for various chemical dyes; optimized photo-physical properties; Cons: Time-consuming genetic modification procedure; requires reliable overexpression system; potential for altering protein activity. Successfully used to label kinesin-1 (unpublished).
* Check labeled molecule's activity is comparable to the wild type before use.

**B. Dye-Selection Considerations for Multicolor, Dynamic Microtubule Assays:**
* High quantum yields and extinction coefficients at laser wavelengths used are desirable for single-molecule detection.
* Literature values should be used as a guide; photo-physical properties change depending on the molecule conjugated to and solution used.
* Commonly used dyes in literature include TAMRA (Helenius et al., 2006; Varga et al., 2006).
* Problems encountered with some dyes, such as Atto 425, when labeling microtubules; control experiments necessary to check functionality.
* Fluorescent labeled tubulin commercially available (Cytoskeleton Inc.).

#### Anti-bleaching and Oxygen Scavenging Cocktails for Single-Molecule TIRF Microscopy

**Single-Molecule TIRF Microscopy: Monitoring Microtubules and MAPs**

**Monitoring microtubule growth/shrinkage and a single MAP at single-resolution**
- Choose dyes with non-overlapping emission spectra for effective signal separation
- Shorter wavelength dye for the MAP to limit contrast issues in TIRF
- Simultaneous dual-color experiments possible with one laser and beam splitter

**Monitoring behavior of two MAPs at single-resolution**
- Choose labels optimized for both laser wavelengths, filter sets, and camera
- Spectral overlap less of an issue
- Microtubules either unlabeled or labeled with a third color

**V. (Anti-)blinking/Photo-Toxicity/Photo-Bleaching Cocktails**

**Glucose Oxidase/Catalase (GODCAT) System with BME as an oxygen scavenging/antifade system:**
1. Glucose is oxidized by glucose oxidase, depleting oxygen in solution
2. Catalase breaks down hydrogen peroxide generated from first step
3. BME quenches triplet states and maintains a reducing environment
4. Store components separately at 4C, mix just before using imaging buffer
5. Add glucose oxidase last for initiation of the reaction
6. Effectiveness can be impacted by buffer capacity and oxygen exchange
7. Experimentation may be necessary for different dye systems

**Trolox as an alternative triplet-state quencher:**
- Known to cause slow blinking with some fluorescent dyes
- Maintain BME present to maintain a reducing environment while using Trolox.

#### GMPCPP-Stabilized Microtubule Preparation and Cycling

**Preparation of GMPCPP-Stabilized Microtubules for Microtubule Depolymerization and Nucleation Assays**

**GMPCPP-Stabilized Microtubules**: Prepared by polymerizing tubulin in the presence of the slowly hydrolyzed GTP analogue, GMPCPP. The distribution of microtubule lengths and their propensity to spontaneously depolymerize can be tailored by altering the concentration of tubulin used in the polymerization reaction and additional cycles of polymerization, respectively.

**Single-Cycled Microtubules**:
- **Average length**: /C243.5 m (suitable as seeds for growing extensions)
- **Polymerization mixture**:
  - 20 M tubulin in BRB80
  - 1 mM GMPCPP
  - Buffer components: GODCAT, BME, Trolox (optional)
- **Polymerization**: Incubate on ice for 5 min and at 37C for 30 min
- **Centrifugation**: Spin in an ultracentrifuge to remove unpolymerized tubulin
- **Stability**: Stable for several hours post-polymerization, depending on initial length

**Double-Cycled Microtubules**:
- **Polymerization**: Perform two cycles of polymerization in GMPCPP to enhance stability
- **Advantages**: Increased proportion of GMPCPP tubulin relative to single-cycled microtubules, reducing guanosine diphosphate (GDP) tubulin and improving stability as substrates for depolymerization studies.

**Double-Cycled Microtubule Preparation**:
- **Cycle 1**: Follow the steps for single-cycled microtubules above, then repeat with fresh GMPCPP solution
- **Centrifugation**: Spin to remove unpolymerized tubulin and resuspend in required buffer
- **Freeze-Thaw Processing**: Microtubules can be stored for months by snap freezing after resuspension. Thaw by incubating at 37C, best to store in aliquots of /C24100 l or less.

#### Glass Surface Preparation and Treatment for TIRF Microscopy

**C. Preparation of Labeled Microtubules**
- **A suitable proportion of dye-labeled tubulin** can be used in the polymerization reaction to provide fluorescent microtubules
- **Biotinylated tubulin** can be incorporated to bind microtubules to a neutravidin-coated surface
- Labeled tubulin can be prepared in-house or purchased commercially
- **Biolabaled microtubules**: 10% biotin-labeled tubulin is combined with unlabeled tubulin in any polymerization protocols
- **Fluorescent microtubules**: Up to 25% TAMRA-labeled tubulin is combined with unlabeled tubulin in any polymerization protocols

**D. General Information on Handling Microtubules/Tubulin**
- **Unpolymerized tubulin**: Stored long-term at -80C in small aliquots and kept on ice prior to use
- **Microtubules**: Should NOT be placed on ice as low temperatures cause rapid depolymerization
- **Long microtubules (>10 m)**: Require a cut pipette tip with a larger opening to minimize shearing
- **Concentration of polymerized tubulin in microtubule solution**: Determined by depolymerizing with appropriate reagents and measuring absorbance at 280 nm

**VII. Glass Treatment and Sample Chamber Preparation**
- Aim is to produce clean, low-fluorescence glass surfaces and flow cells for immobilizing microtubules/seeds and passivating against unwanted absorption

**B. Safety**
- Many chemicals used are potentially harmful, corrosive, or explosive; must be handled with care in a suitable fume hood

**C. Glass Cleaning and Surface Preparation**
- **Precleaning**: Sonicate, rinse, and soak coverglasses in various solvents to remove organic matter
- **Piranha solution cleaning**: Removes organic matter and activates OH groups on glass surface for silanization
- **Silanization**: Activated glass surfaces are treated with a silane solution to render them hydrophobic, making them unattractive for dirt adsorption

---

#### Microtubule Attachment Methods for Dynamic Assays

**Microtubule Assays Using TIRF: Silanization and Sample Chamber Assembly**

**Silanization of Glass Surfaces:**
- Dynamic microtubule assays using TIRF require hydrophobic silane-functionalized coverglasses for efficient passivation (Section VIII)
- Perform silanization with 0.05% solution of DDS in TCE (trichloroethylene)
- Coverglasses bathed for 1 hour in TCE/DDS solution, then transferred through three methanol baths and dried completely
- Store silanized coverglasses at room temperature or under nitrogen to avoid crystal formation

**Sample Chamber Assembly:**
- Use a metal holder with clear central aperture to assemble sample chambers (Fig. 5)
- Clamp hydrophobic-rendered 22/C222 mm slide in the holder and lay down three channels using double-sided scotch tape or Nescofilm
- Press 18/C18 mm slide onto the tape to define channels (depth /C24100 m)
- Machine holders thin and chamfer around clear aperture for microscope objective access
- Use multiple layers of tape to increase channel volume and decrease surface area-to-volume ratio.

**Binding of Microtubules and Passivation:**
- Spacer proteins attach nonspecifically to silanized coverglasses but specifically to microtubules
- Immobilized microtubules can be used for polymerization, depolymerization studies, or studying MAP mechanisms
- Spacer protein ensures bottom surface accessibility and minimal surface deformation

**Commonly Used Methods of Attachment:**
1. Antitubulin antibody binding: nonspecific binding to tubulin; disadvantages include potential dissociation from microtubule due to free tubulin competition.
2. Double-sided scotch tape or Nescofilm: strong attachment, no contact with microtubule lattice; disadvantages include requiring labeled tubulin for some assays and potential channel blocking by large molecules.
3. Antifluorophore binding to labeled tubulin: advantageous when using fluorescent labels but dependent on labeling density of microtubules.
4. Neutravidin binding to biotinylated tubulin: strong binding, free tubulin does not compete for attachment; requires inclusion of biotinylated tubulin in microtubules.

#### Dynamic Microtubule Assays with TIRF Imaging

**Seed Binding/Surface Passivation Protocol**

**Step 1: Antibody/Neutravidin Incubation**
- Perfuse antibeta-tubulin SAP4G5 and antitetramethylrhodamine into the hydrophobic-rendered glass flow cell using a vacuum at concentrations of:
  - Antibeta-tubulin SAP4G5: 1:50 1:200 dilution in BRB80
  - Antitetramethylrhodamine: 10 20 g/ml (in BRB80)
  - Neutravidin: 5 50 g/ml (in BRB80)

- Excess antibody/neutravidin is flushed out with 10 channel volumes of BRB80

**Step 2: Surface Passivation**
- Remaining surface is passivated to block nonspecific binding using Pluronic F127
  - Tri-block copolymer consisting of two outer poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and an inner poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) blocks
  - PEO parts form a 10-nm thick polymer brush, effectively blocking protein adsorption
- Use 1% Pluronic F127 in BRB80 for 5 minutes
- Excess F127 is removed with 10 channel volumes of BRB80

**Step 3: Preparing the Channel for Microtubules**
- After passivation, the channel is ready for perfusion of solution containing prepared microtubules or microtubule seeds
- Incubation time depends on immobilization method, microtubule seed, antibody/neutravidin concentration, and desired microtubule density

**Dynamic Microtubule Assays**

**A. Protocol for Dynamic Microtubule Assay**

#### Gradient Surface Preparation for Combinatorial Protein Studies

**Optical 3D-Nanometry and Kinesin Motors: Studying with Gliding Motility Assay**
* **Schematic diagram of a gliding motility assay:** Reconstituted microtubules, tagged with semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots), propelled over a kinesin-coated substrate surface. [See Fig. 1 and Plate no. 16 in the Color Plate Section.]
* **Gliding Motility Assay:** Critical steps include treatment of surfaces and flow chamber preparation. No general protocol works for all motor proteins; each assay must be optimized for specific protein use. Evidence of successful assays: reproducible experiments and consistent velocities with in vivo activity.
* **Surface Treatment and Flow Chamber Preparation:** Depending on experiment, clean glass coverslips or silicon wafers using various procedures to adjust surface properties. Careful preparation essential for high-quality results. Listed procedures: easy-clean, protein repelling surfaces (PEG), hydrophobic surfaces (dichlorodimethylsilane), and gradient surfaces (PEG).
* **Easy-Clean Procedure:** Load coverslips or wafers into porcelain or PTFE racks; sonicate in mucasol, ethanol, and nanopure water; blow dry. Mildly hydrophilic surfaces suitable for single-molecule fluorescence measurements.
* **Protein Repelling Surfaces (PEG):** Coverslips/chips treated with ethanol, piranha cleaning solution, and nanopure water; incubated in toluene with PEG-silane and HCl; rinsed in toluene, ethanol, and nanopure water. Protein repellant surfaces prevent protein interaction for imaging purposes.
* **Hydrophobic Surfaces (Dichlorodimethylsilane):** Clean silicon wafer chips using ultrasonic bath with chloroform; place in piranha cleaning solution and nanopure water; spin-coat thin layers of polyglycidylmethacrylate (PGMA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI); anneal at 100C for 1 hour. Hydrophobic surfaces strongly adsorb antibodies as adapter proteins but block nonspecific protein binding using casein or Pluronics.
* **Gradient Surfaces (PEG):** Clean silicon wafer chips in ultrasonic bath with chloroform; place in piranha cleaning solution and nanopure water; spin-coat thin layers of polyglycidylmethacrylate (PGMA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI); anneal at 100C for 1 hour.

#### Labeling Microtubules for Motor Behavior Analysis

**Motility Assays Using Kinesin-1**

**Surface Blocking Strategy:**
- Use casein or other proteins (e.g., BSA) to prevent kinesin-1 denaturation at the surface
  - Recommended: Supplement ATP-containing motility solution with 250.2 mg/ml casein

**Specific Immobilization via Antibodies:**
1. Flow chamber construction using hydrophobic glass coverslips
2. Perfuse penta-His antibodies in BRB80 for 5 minutes to bind motor proteins specifically to surface via His-tags
3. Incubate with 1 mg/ml casein in BRB80 for 5 minutes to prevent nonspecific protein binding
4. Flow in 10 g/ml kinesin-1 (with a His-tag) in BRB80 supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml casein and 10 mM - 1 mM ATP for 5 minutes
5. Perform actual gliding motility assay using microtubule-containing motility solution

#### Optical Microscopy Techniques for Studying Kinesin Motors

**Imaging of Microtubule Motility**

**Tips:**
- When using antibodies to immobilize motor proteins, keep antibody concentration low to avoid nonspecific binding of QDs.
- Store QDs in original solution and add just before use due to potential interference with casein.
- Microtubules can also be bound to QDs in a test tube, but elevated microtubule concentrations, long incubation times, high biotinylation rates, and free biotinylated tubulin may cause issues.

**Imaging Techniques:**
- **TIRF Microscopy**: High contrast imaging of fluorescent objects near transparent substrate surfaces using a TIRF slider and DIC objective.
- **FLIC Microscopy**: Obtains nanometer height information of fluorescent objects above reflective surfaces, with a periodic modulation in detected intensity as function of object height.

**Dual-Color Imaging:**
- Use single-band excitation in blue range for simultaneous imaging of microtubules (green Alexa 488) and QDs (red at 655 nm).
- Separate emission colors using a spectral beam splitter mounted between microscope and camera.
- Calibrate dual-color overlay using multicolor beads before motor immobilization procedure.

**Temperature Control:**
- Use Peltier element connected to heat sink for precise temperature control during imaging.
- Power the Peltier element with a remotely controllable, automated laboratory power supply and switch polarity for heating or cooling.
- Measure temperature on Peltier element using thermometer with analog readout capability and tissue implantable thermocouple microprobe.

---

#### Maximum Intensity Projections and Kymographs for Quick Motility Analysis

**Temperature Control Setup**
- Thermometer and power supply connected to imaging computer via PCI card
- Temperature control programmed in journal within imaging software (Metamorph)
- Calculates current needed for Peltier element based on temperature readout
- Fine-tuning algorithm checks temperature difference from target and adjusts power accordingly
- Allows temperature regulation against thermal power loss, ambient temperature changes, and inaccuracies of Peltier element characterisitics

**Temperature Control Range and Response Time**
- Controls sample temperature range from 10 to 100C with a few seconds response time
- Defocusing occurs linearly with temperature, compensated for by adjusting z-position of microscope stage
- Focus compensation is too slow for very fast temperature switches, but image comes back into focus as temperature change slows down

**Practical Considerations**
- Sample must be tightly fixed on microscope stage to avoid unwanted shifting in field of view
- Thermal drift can be reduced by allowing flow chamber and sample holder to thermally equilibrate before imaging
- Airflow from air-conditioned rooms can cause significant stage drift; build a closed box around the microscope to mitigate this
- Use bright fluorescent beads as drift control in sample, averaging their positions if necessary
- Buffer evaporates at edges of flow channels, causing changes in concentration and ionic strength; seal channel with vacuum grease or sigillum wax to avoid this
- Exchanging solutions in flow chamber during imaging can cause nonreversible slowdown of motility due to photo effects from oxygen introduction; interrupt illumination for 10-30 seconds after buffer exchange to allow scavenger system to deplete oxygen

**Quick Motility Evaluation in Two Dimensions**
- Maximum intensity projections and kymographs available in standard image acquisition and processing software (e.g., ImageJ, Metamorph) for quick evaluation of key motility parameters like gliding velocities
- Maximum projections depict trajectories of multiple moving objects within a field of view, while kymographs analyze single object trajectories along a given path in a time-resolved manner.

#### Measuring Microtubule Motility Using Quantum Dots and Gaussian Fitting

**Methods for Measuring Microtubule Velocities**

**Maximum Projections:**
- Measure distances traveled by microtubules and divide by time between first and last image in stack
- Useful when:
  - Signal of a point source of light (QD) is available to measure distance traveled accurately
  - Whole microtubule labeled with fluorescent dyes, allowing measurement of path and length
- Restrictions include:
  - Crowded images in long stacks or with many moving objects
  - Difficulty measuring velocities if objects leave the field of view
  - Questionable significance of obtained velocity values for unsteady movements

**Kymographs:**
- Display intensity values along a predefined path over time, showing time information at the cost of spatial resolution
- Mark the path of moving object and generate kymograph using data processing software
- Measure velocities directly or calculate from lengths on time and space axes
- Advantage: precise velocity measurements at specific points in time/space.

**Gaussian Function-Based Localization:**
- Fluorescent objects smaller than wavelength of light can be localized with higher precision than optical microscope resolution (~200 nm)
- Fit intensity profiles to 2D Gaussian functions:
  1. Radially symmetric, fixed width
  2. Radially symmetric, non-fixed width
  3. Elliptical 2D Gaussian function representing probability density of bivariate normal distribution
- Allows accommodation for slightly defocused images and particles larger than PSF width
- Calculate precise intensity values under Gaussians for applications like FLIC height measurements.

**Microtubule Motility Analysis:**
- QDs attached to microtubules resolve 8 nm steps in kinesin-1 motors' lattice movements and even 4 nm steps with two active motors
- Gliding assays allow counting number of processive motors based on distinct GFP-labeled motor molecules and low microtubule density.

- Fine scanning: Regions fitted with estimated starting parameters and error estimation
- Interpolating filament shape using spline interpolation based on position and orientation of segments
- Tracks connected using feature point tracking algorithm, cost function calculated for four frames
- Occlusions handled through post-processing step to merge corresponding tracks

**3D Tracking in Third Dimension:**
- Complement 2D microscopic results with data from third dimension
- Approaches based on dual-focus imaging or split-image methods technically demanding and require sophisticated setup
- Alternative approach using FLIC microscopy relies on interference effects of excitation and emission light within a distance of about 1m from reflecting surface.

**Tubulin Oligomers Analysis by Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC)**

**Introduction:**
- Describes using AUC in Beckman XLA to study tubulin self-association and drug interaction
- Standard methods, including sample preparation, instrument operation, and data collection
- Focuses on analyzing sedimentation velocity data using DCDT 2, generating g(s) distributions, and fitting weight average sedimentation coefficients Sw to isodesmic or indefinite assembly models for extracting Kisovalues

**Materials and Methods:**
A. Sample Equilibration, Buffer Composition, and Concerns for AUC Work
- Double beam mode with reference sectors used in AUC measurements
- Tubulin samples must be equilibrated to avoid buffer component signals
- Thermodynamic work requires exhaustive dialysis, but tubulin is unstable and prone to aggregation
- Preferred method: G-50 fine spun column (Penefsky) that equilibrates the sample in a few minutes
- Typical buffers include 10 mM Pipes or Mes, 1 mM MgSO4, 2mM EGTA, and 50 mM GXP/AXP at pH 6.5-7.5
- Absorbance measurements cannot be performed above ~100 mM GXP or AXP due to degraded signal to noise
- Prefer TCEP over DTT/DTE because of less absorbance, lack of oxidation by air, and absence of pH dependence (but can produce small baseline drifts in equilibrium runs)

B. Filling Cells, Setting Up the Instrument, and Performing a Run
- Description of steps for filling cells, setting up the instrument, and conducting an AUC run
- Importance of equilibrating samples with reference blanks to avoid buffer component signals
- Mention of new FDS system and pseudo absorbance mode as exceptions to double beam measurements.

**Results and Discussion:**
A. Tubulin Oligomers
- Description of self-association properties of tubulin into small oligomers, forming spiral polymers and rings with Mg2+ and vinca alkaloids as a function of concentration
- Energy, thermodynamic studies on families of vinca alkaloid derivatives correlated with IC50 and clinical drug doses

B. Vinca Alkaloid-Induced Spirals
- Detailed investigation into the mode of association, stoichiometry, energetics, and thermodynamics of tubulin self-association with vinca alkaloids
- Correlation between IC50 and clinical drug doses for various derivatives.

**Summary:**
- AUC has been a central technique in understanding cytoskeletal components through studying tubulin self-association, MAP interactions, molecular motors' interaction with microtubules.

#### Preparation and Analysis of Tubulin Samples for Analytical Ultracentrifugation AUC

**Tubulin Preparation using PC-tubulin Beads**

**Preparation of Tubulin:**
1. Store tubulin beads (~4-10 mg/ml) in liquid nitrogen and keep at /C080C in plastic bottles.
2. Carefully pour thawed beads into a 10-ml glass beaker, weigh them, and move the beaker to room temperature water for thawing.
3. Centrifuge the spun column and 15-ml polypropylene conical tube at speed 5 (max speed 7) for 2 minutes at 4C in a clinical centrifuge.
4. Discard flow-through buffer and place the spun column in a dry 15-ml conical tube.
5. Slowly load thawed PC-tubulin onto the dried column, being careful not to squirt material down the sides before re-swelling of the gel. Centrifuge at speed 5 for 2 minutes.
6. Repeat steps with buffers containing glycerol and recycle G-50 by adding used resin to a 500-ml flask with water and 0.01% NaAzide until sufficient quantity is accumulated for refining and extensive washing with deionized water.
7. Measure OD at 278 nm, dilute 10-fold (60/600 ml), and calculate tubulin concentration using the formula: [Tubulin] = 10/C2OD/1.2 in mg/ml or 10 times larger in M (tubulin is a 100-KD heterodimer).
8. Prepare samples for AUC analysis by making up three samples of 500-600 ml at the desired OD and filling cells with rotor holes following this order: reference, lowest concentration sample, higher concentrations (from lowest to highest).
9. Seal cells, align them in the rotor, place in chamber, equilibrate temperature, and set up wavelength and radial data for each cell using current Beckman software. Collect data at 278 nm with a single flash of the lamp at a spacing of 0.002 cm, selecting at least 99 scans per cell (for proper c(s) analysis) and stopping XLA after last scan.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Older clinical centrifuges have rheostat designs; adjust speed accordingly to ensure complete recovery without drying out the resin in the process.
- For proteins smaller than stathmin, use G-10 for adequate recovery.

#### Analysis of Tubulin Oligomers by Analytical Ultracentrifugation and DCDT2 Software

**Preparing for an Analytical Ultracentrifuge Run**

**Setting Up Parameters**:
- Click "Start Methods Scan" before vacuum drops below 50 m (for runs over 3 K with an analytical rotor)
- Clean the flash lamp regularly to maintain high intensity, especially in lower UV (e.g., toothpaste and a soft brush with methanol)

**Data Collection and Analysis**:
- Use DCDT2 or Sedfit for data processing
- Generate g(s) distributions, weight average sedimentation coefficients (Sw), and analyze using an isodesmic model
- Plot Sw vs. protein/drug concentration to verify trend in the data
- Normalize g(s) curves to enhance resolution
- Use consistent peak broadening limit (100-150 kDa) between different runs for better appearance and signal noise.
- Direct boundary fitting is done with Sedanal

#### Tubulin Oligomer Analysis Using AUC Sedimentation Velocity

**Tubulin Oligomer Analysis using AUC**

**Preparation for Analysis:**
- Collect data as a function of concentration for self-association reactions
- Use software packages like Hydro and Sedanal for fitting and analysis
- Convert data to S 20,w values if necessary (not essential for Sedanal)
- Measure density in an Anton Paar DMA 5000 at experimental temperature
- Have C23/C26 and extinction coefficient information available

**Typical Data:**
- Figure 1: Subset of 18 scans used to generate g(s) curves
- Shift to higher s values and larger polymer sizes (Figure 1B)
- Normalized g(s) curves emphasize utility of normalized plots (Figure 1D)

**Analysis:**
- Analyze data using DCDT 2 and plot Swdata vs protein concentrations (Figure 1C)
- Isodesmic model fitted with dotted line, Kis value = 2.98 /C2104M/C01 (Figure 1C)
- Strong Mg concentration dependence (Frigon and Timasheff, 1975a,b; Sontag et al., 2004)

**Direct Boundary Fitting:**
- Use Sedanal for analysis of isodesmic sedimentation velocity data
- Preprocess data, globally fit to an isodesmic model
- Select pairs of scans and remove systematic noise
- Large number of points required (>2400) with more point density at base of cell
- User must select Si vs Ni relationship (Figure 3) based on a 42-bead helical model

**Example Direct Boundary Fit:**
- Figure 5: Global fit of six data sets describes sedimenting boundaries
- Robustness of direct boundary fitting over S wanalysis (Alday and Correia, 2009)

**Oligomer Formation:**
- Presence of tubulin oligomers not always appreciated in the field
- Nonpolymerized tubulin, meaning fraction not in microtubules or pelleting
- Increased microtubule disassembly rates at higher Mg concentrations (OBrien et al., 1990)
- Oligomer stabilization related to mechanism of action of microtubule destabilizing motors like MCAK (Desai et al., 1999)
- Recent study using nm-resolution optical tweezers concluded only heterodimers involved in assembly/disassembly excursions (Chapter 12 by Charlebois et al.)

#### Alkaloid-Induced Spirals Analysis Methods and Data Fitting in AUC

**Experiments on Mg Concentration and Microtubule Growth**
- Experiments done only in 1-mM Mg conditions (squares in Fig. 4)
- Role of small oligomers in microtubule growth or shortening under other solution conditions is still open question
- In the presence of XMAP215, microtubule growth involves large excursions or steps, consistent with MAPs nucleating and facilitating growth through interactions with oligomers (Kerssemakers et al., 2006)

**Simulation of Tubulin Oligomer Distributions**
- Size distributions simulated for various Kisovalues corresponding to 0 and 10 mM Mg
- Curves generated at two protein concentrations: 2 mg/ml and 14 mg/ml total tubulin (Fig. 4)

**Alkaloid-Induced Spirals Study Methods**
- Similar methods used for studying vinca alkaloid-induced spirals
- Weight average analysis approaches extensively described in Lobert and Correia (2000), and Lobert et al. (1997)
- Major difference is the fitter input requires:
  - S w, protein concentration in mg/ml
  - Drug concentrations in M for each data point
- Extent of reaction is both protein and drug concentration dependent
- Sample equilibration done by Penefsky at each drug concentration with additional step of diluting the protein to desired concentration prior to drug equilibration
- Ligand-induced indefinite K2,app value that applies to each sample can be expressed as:
  - K2;app = K1Drug/C138/C16/C172, where K1 describes affinity for drug for tubulin heterodimers and K2 is the indefinite association constant. (Correia et al., 2005)
- Procedures required to fit these data with Sedanal described in Correia et al. (2005)
