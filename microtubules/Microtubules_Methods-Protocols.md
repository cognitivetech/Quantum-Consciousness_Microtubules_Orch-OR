- Mitotic spindle is a microtubule-based machine, consisting of:
  - Kinetochore microtubules connecting spindle pole and chromatid kinetopores
  - Interpolar microtubles from two poles interdigitating at the spindle equator
  - Astral microtubules radiating out from the poles in the cytoplasm
- Mitotic spindle must have two poles to pull sister chromatids to opposite ends of the cell
- Mechanisms for maintaining bipolarity include:
  - Centrosome-dependent mechanism
  - Self-organization based on chromosomal ability to nucleate and stabilize microtubules

- Afnity resin is used for protein purification

**Tubulin Purification**:
- Porcine brain tissues are used to extract tubulin
- Various buffers, including depolymerization buffer and high molarity PIPES buffer, are used in the process
- Succinimidyl ester-conjugated tetramethylrhodamine and biotin are used for labeling

## Part III: Microtubule-Based Active Matters

**Active Matters: Microtubule-Based Active Nematic Liquid Crystals**

**Equilibrium Liquid Crystals**: Studied for over a century, led to commonplace applications like display technology.

**Active Nematics**: A new class of liquid crystal materials driven out of equilibrium by continuous motion of constituent anisotropic units.

**Experimental Realization**: Based on rod-like cytoskeletal laments driven out of equilibrium by molecular motors.

**Protocols for Assembling Active Nematic Liquid Crystals**:
1. Purification of each protein:
   - Microtubules (MTs) and associated proteins play vital roles in cellular functions
   - Minimal in vitro MT systems aim to recreate these processes with minimal components
2. Assembly Process:
   - **Two-dimensional active nematic on water/oil interface**:
      * Purification of tubulin from calf brain using temperature sensitive polymerization-depolymerization cycles and differential centrifugation
      * Tubulin recycling to remove aggregates and non-polymerizable monomers
      - Labeling tubulin with fluorescent dyes or other functionalities for systematic control of emergent properties
   * **Isotropic uids**: Microtubules stabilized with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, GMPCPP, to suppress turnover and allow for long lifetime polymerized microtubules.
3. Kinesin Protein Expression:
   - ATP-dependent molecular motor that steps along a microtubule
   - Protocol describes expression and purification of kinesin-1 fragment (K401) fused to a biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit (BCCP tag)
4. Kinesin Purification:
   - Purifying the kinesin from bacteria pellet using FPLC and a HisTrap column, similar to any His-tag protein purification with slight variations to prevent aggregation.

#### Tubulin Purification Methods and Materials for Microtubule Active Matter

**Kinesin and Streptavidin Motor Clusters**
- Microtubule sliding is powered by clusters of **kinesin motors** held together by tetrameric streptavidin
- Optimal efficiency achieved for clusters assembled with 2 biotinylated kinesins and 1 streptavidin
- Multiple motor types can efficiently drive non-equilibrium dynamics of microtubule-based active matter:
    - **Kinesin 401**: Dimeric motor, predominantly used in generation of an active nematic [6]
    - **Kinesin 365**: Monomeric motor containing the neck domain, can maintain an active nematic even though it is non-processive [20]
    - **Kinesin 560**: Forms clusters of unknown order due to nonspecific interactions, generates an active nematic without requiring the addition of streptavidin [27]

**ATP Regeneration System and Antioxidants**
- Kinesin motor stepping is powered by ATP hydrolysis
- To keep system dynamics constant, a **biochemical chemical ATP regeneration system** is used to quickly regenerate ATP from ADP through the action of an enzyme, pyruvate kinase [4,5]

**Polyacrylamide Coating**
- Acrylamide brush is assembled on the coverslip to prevent protein adhesion
- The resulting surface is sterically repulsive and hydrophilic

**Assembling 3D Isotropic Gels**
- Microtubules can form either 3D isotropic gels or 2D nematics
- Requires hard-wall boundaries to suppress protein adsorption
- Hydrophilic surface is made with a polyacrylamide brush

**Assembling 2D Active Nematic**
- Presence of a surfactant-stabilized liquid-liquid interface promotes assembly of dense 2D active nematic liquid crystals
- To stabilize the liquid-liquid interface, the two sides of the chamber have different surface treatments:
    - Hydrophobic surface (rain-x or aquapel) promotes wetting of the thin oil layer
    - Hydrophilic surface is coated with a polyacrylamide brush

**Depletion Interactions**
- Depletion forces arise between large assemblies suspended in a dilute solution of smaller, excluded solutes
- PEG causes formation of motor-driven extensible bundles, with the concentration and molecular weight determining the bundle structure

**Measuring Orientation Field from Polarization Microscopy (LC-PolScope)**
- Quantitative polarization microscopy can be used to measure the orientation field and retardance/density field of the active nematic over time
- Provides pixel-level resolution of the orientation field

### Chapter 17: Investigating Tubulin-Drug Interaction Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy

**Fluorescence Spectroscopy for Tubulin-Drug Interactions**

**Introduction:**
- Fluorescence spectroscopy used in biological imaging and protein interaction studies
- Intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine
- High sensitivity to environmental changes
- Tryptophan residues make tubulin uorescence intense

**Fluorescence Techniques:**
- Determine binding characteristics of protein-protein or protein-small molecule interactions
- Uorescence intensity changes indicate conformational or environmental changes
- Useful for investigating tubulin-drug interactions

**Tryptophan Fluorescence in Tubulin:**
- Each subunit of tubulin has 4 tryptophans, making a total of 8 per heterodimer
- Absorbance maximum is around 280 nm but excited at longer wavelengths (e.g., 295 nm) to avoid tyrosine excitation

**Determining Dissociation Constant using Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence of Tubulin:**
- Monitor changes in intrinsic tryptophan uorescence upon drug binding
- Kd and stoichiometry can be determined from uorescence change data (Fig. 1a, b)
- Equations to calculate dissociation constant: Kd = [TD] / [Ttotal] x [D] or F / Fmax = Kd x [D] / [C138] x [C2]
- Determine bound drug concentration by calculating the difference between total and free drug concentrations (assuming one binding site per protein molecule)

**Methods:**
- Provided detailed protocols for several fluorescence spectroscopic assays to determine dissociation constant and compare binding affinity of drugs
- Intrinsic uorescence of tubulin can be used to determine binding affinity of a non-tryptophan containing protein
- Determine stoichiometry by fitting data into binding isotherms (e.g., Langmuir, Scatchard)
- Protocols for competitive inhibition methods to determine drug binding site on tubulin using fluorescence spectroscopy.

---

#### Determining Drug-Tubulin Binding Constants Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy

**Kd Calculation using Quadratic Equation:**
- Kd can be calculated by quadratic equation: [TD] complex, a1, b/C0([Ttotal]+[Dtotal]+Kd), c=[Ttotal]/C2[Dtotal]
- Tryptophan fluorescence change (F) represents [TD], maximum change in fluorescence (Fmax) represents Ttotal.

**Correcting for Inner Filter Effect:**
- Inner filter effect can affect uorescence measurements and should be corrected before using in equations: Fcorrected = Fobserved /C2*antilog(Absorbance excitation - Absorbance emission)

**Determination of Dissociation Constant using Drug Fluorescence:**
- Dissociation constant (Kd) and stoichiometry can be determined using intrinsic drug fluorescence.
- Change in uorescence intensity of a drug upon binding to tubulin (F) can be used to calculate Kd with equations: FmaxDtotal/C138, Kd /C0, FmaxDtotal/C138, Kd 2/C04/C2Fmax/C2Dtotal/C138q 2.
- Scatchard equation can be used to determine bound and free drug concentration (r, n, Dfree) for calculating Kd: r = bound drug per tubulin, n = stoichiometry of binding, F = change in uorescence intensity at a particular drug concentration, Fmax = maximum change in uorescence upon binding at saturation.

**Determining Dissociation Constant using Fluorescent Analogs:**
- Nonfluorescent drugs can be converted to fluorescent analogs and their binding constants determined through uorescence spectroscopy after conrming equivalent biological activity.

### Chapter 20: Mechanical Deformation of Microtubules on a Two-Dimensional Elastic Medium

**Chapter 20: Mechanical Deformation of Microtubules on a Two-Dimensional Elastic Medium**

**Abstract**
- Microtubule, an essential cytoskeletal component, plays significant roles in cellular mechano-transduction and regulation.
- Mechanical stress can cause deformation of microtubules involved in various cellular events.
- Experimental and simulation approaches have confirmed the effect of mechanical stress on microtubule properties, but the mechanism of deformation remains unclear.

**Introduction**
- Microtubules are composed of protolaments of - and -tubulin heterodimers.
- Their mechanical integrity allows them to play crucial roles in cellular processes like cell shape regulation and intracellular transport.
- In living cells, microtubules are often observed to be curved or buckled or even fragmented due to various reasons: interaction with motor proteins, actomyosin contractility, force exerted by polymerization, or external mechanical impact.

**Experimental Approach**
- This chapter demonstrates a method to replicate the mechanical stress-induced deformation in microtubules in vitro.
- A custom-made mechanical device called the micro-stretcher is used to apply compressive or tensile stress on microtubules attached to an elastic substrate through interaction with kinesin, a motor protein.

**Micro-Stretcher Design and Components**
- The micro-stretcher consists of two main parts: the base plate and the cover head.
  - The base plate contains inlets and outlets for N2 gas supply, a circular opening for observation, and clamps to attach PDMS substrate.
  - The cover head has a rectangular window for adding observation buffers.
- Movable stretchers connected to computer-controlled DC motors are attached to the base plate.
- The software SG Commander by Sigma Koki Co. Ltd. is used to control the micro-stretcher via an RS232C interface.

**Substrate Materials and Preparation**
- PDMS substrate (elastomer) with a thickness of 1 cm (see Note 1).
- Proteins: porcine brain tubulin, fluorescence dye-labeled tubulin, GFP-fused kinesin-1, anti-GFP antibody.
- Preparation of K560-GFP involves agarose gel plates and TPM medium (see Note 2).

**Materials List**
- Micro-stretcher: base plate, cover head, movable stretcher, computer-controlled DC motors, SG Commander software.
- Substrate: PDMS substrate (elastomer) with a thickness of 1 cm.
- Proteins: porcine brain tubulin, fluorescence dye-labeled tubulin, GFP-fused kinesin-1, anti-GFP antibody.

### Chapter 21: Real-Time Imaging of Single TuRC-Mediated Microtubule Nucleation Events In Vitro by TIRF Microscopy

**Microtubule Nucleation by TuRC: Real-Time Imaging with TIRF Microscopy**

**Introduction:**
- The tubulin ring complex (TuRC) is the major microtubule nucleator in cells, but its activity and regulation are not well understood.
- Measuring quantitatively how TuRC interacts with tubulin and potential regulators at a molecular level is crucial for gaining insight into microtubule nucleation and regulation.

**Assay Description:**
- A total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy-based assay on chemically functionalized glass slides was developed to study surface immobilized, purified TuRC in real time at a single molecule level.
- This assay allows the measurement of microtubule nucleation by TuRC under various conditions and in the presence or absence of potential regulators.

**Advantages:**
- Provides previously unavailable opportunity for quantitative studies on kinetics of microtubule nucleation by TuRC.
- Allows real-time observation of individual nucleation events, which cannot be achieved with bulk assays.
- Small sample volumes are sufficient and do not require large amounts of purified TuRC.

**Materials:**
1. **Equipment for Glass Surface Chemistry:**
   a. Glass beakers
   b. Petri dishes (Duroplan)
   c. Cover glasses (22 /C222 mm coverslips) for functionalized glass or standard microscopy slides (76/C226 mm) for passivated glass.
2. **Preparation of Functionalized Glass Surfaces:**
   a. Chemically functionalized glass surfaces are used to immobilize biotinylated TuRC.
   b. Preparation involves cleaning, silane coating, and activation with amino groups for biotinylation (using biotin-NHS) and subsequent coupling of streptavidin or neutravidin.
3. **Preparation of Fluorescently Labeled Tubulin:**
   a. Fluorescently labeled tubulin is used to visualize microtubule nucleation by TuRC.
   b. This involves labeling alpha-tubulin with a fluorescent dye (e.g., Alexa Fluor 647) through covalent attachment of the dye to a lysine residue or via a biotin-streptavidin system.
4. **Assay Procedure:**
   a. TuRC is immobilized on functionalized glass surfaces using streptavidin or neutravidin.
   b. Fluorescently labeled tubulin solution is added to the coverslip, and microtubule nucleation by TuRC is monitored in real time using TIRF microscopy.
5. **Troubleshooting:**
   a. Common issues include poor immobilization of TuRC or nonspecific binding of tubulin. These can be addressed through optimizing surface preparation, adjusting concentrations of reagents, and controlling temperature and pH levels.
6. **Extensions:**
   a. The assay can be modified to study TuRC in the presence of potential regulators or microtubule dynamics modulators. This allows for further investigation into the regulation of TuRC-mediated microtubule nucleation.

### Chapter 25: Reconstituting the Interaction Between Purified Nuclei and Microtubule Network

**Chapter 25: Reconstituting Interaction Between Piezodisc Nuclei and Microtubule Network**

**Abstract:**
- Nucleus is a stiff organelle involved in morphogenetic processes such as cell migration, differentiation, senescence, etc.
- Recent studies reveal mechanisms regulating nucleus stiffness and deformation through chromatin swelling, lamin density, actin filaments, microtubules (MTs), etc.
- Nucleus shape is a result of balance between external forces and internal resistance. In adherent cells, actin network dominates force production; in nonadherent cells, MTs take over.
- Reconstitution assays essential for deciphering players contributing to mechanical balance.

**Materials (Section 1): Nucleus Purification Protocol:**
- Cell scraping not applicable to nonadherent cells due to potential damage to nuclear envelope.
- Detergent-based protocols also unsuitable for preserving structure of nuclear envelope.
- Developed a new nucleus purification protocol for nonadherent cells: intact nuclear envelope essential for reconstitution assays.

**Materials (Section 2): Microtubule Polymerization and Taxol Stabilization:**
1. Tubulin purified from bovine brain using temperature-dependent assembly/disassembly cycles in BRB80 buffer [30].
2. MAP-free neurotubulin obtained through cation-exchange chromatography in 50 mM PIPES, supplemented with MgCl2 and EGTA [31].
3. Tubulin labeled with ATTO-565 fluorescent dye as previously described [32].
4. Microtubules polymerized from neurotubulin for 30 min at 37C, then layered onto NaHEPES cushions and centrifuged [30].
5. Resuspended microtubules in BRB80 buffer supplemented with glycerol and labeled with NHS-ATTO dye [ATTO Tec], followed by a second polymerization/depolymerization cycle before use.

**Methods:**
1. Developed nucleus purification protocol for nonadherent cells preserving the nuclear envelope intact.
2. Reconstitution assays in vitro to investigate specific roles of various parameters involved in nucleus deformation.
3. Combination with microtubule gliding assay allows competition between kinesin-1 motors and nucleus-bound dynein for MT interaction.
4. Purified nuclei from distinct cell types interact differently with the array of microtubules, enabling in-depth studies on MT-nucleus interactions.

- These reagents enable researchers to reversibly modulate microtubule-dependent processes in eukaryotes, including applications in cargo transport, cell migration, division, and embryonic development.

**Theory of Small Molecule Photoswitching**:
- Photoswitchable small molecule reagents, or "photo-pharmaceuticals," are small molecules that undergo a reversible structural change upon absorbing light.
- These reagents consist of a chemical photoswitch fused into the structure of a parent pharmaceutical drug type (e.g., colchicine, Taxol).
- Photopharmaceuticals have advantages over photouncageable drugs, but often have 10- to 100-fold losses of potency due to the need to include the photoswitch.

**Available Photoswitchable Microtubule Inhibitors**:
- Several classes of photoswitches are used in photopharmaceuticals, each with distinct biological and chemical properties.
- The ideal photopharmaceutical designs have two states (E and Z) where:
  - One isomer is bioactive while the other is not active at all
  - Two different wavelengths of light can be used to isomerize the molecules between the two forms

**Usage and Limitations**:
- Photopharmaceuticals have distinct limitations compared to other optical systems, and it is more efficient to establish assays from scratch rather than adapting protocols from optogenetics or photobleaching.
- Biologists may find the current reviews on photopharmaceuticals written for synthetic chemists or focused on future applications to medicinal chemistry.
- The most relevant prior works are user guides and discussions for specific MT photoswitches (PSTs and SBTub).

**Focus of Chapter**:
- This chapter focuses on establishing assays for temporally reversible, cell-specific inhibition of microtubule dynamics using Taxol- or colchicine-like photoswitchable reagents.
- The protocols allow for precise control over MT network depolymerization, mitotic arrest, migration arrest, and even cell death.

#### Photoswitching Microtubule Dynamics Wavelength Selection for Efficient Isomerization

**Photopharmaceuticals and Microtubule Dynamics**

**Background:**
- Photopharmaceuticals: exclusively present as one isomer in dark state, relax back to dark state (thermal relaxation)
- Most photoswitches cannot achieve complete photoisomerization from E to Z and vice versa
- Ideal photopatterning involves inhibiting MT dynamics in zone 1 while keeping zone 2 free of inhibition

**Challenges:**
- Diffusion counteracts spatial localization of photoisomer patterning
- Diffusional reversibility affected by convection and embedding materials
- Important to choose best practical photoisomerization wavelengths for most complete photoswitching

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Dark State and Dark Conditions**: Photopharmaceuticals are in their pure form before illumination, stored under dark conditions to maintain the dark state.
2. **Relaxation**: Most photoswitches relax back from any Z:E ratio until they return to the dark state. For MT reagents, this is not possible for some as they cannot be photoisomerized back towards significant E fractions using biological wavelengths.
3. **Operating Photopharmaceuticals:**
   a) Choose best practical photoisomerization wavelengths: those available on the setup that give most complete photoswitching.
   b) Determine Z:E ratios at PSS for different wavelengths to find the best 1 (enriching Z isomer) and 2 (enriching E isomer).
4. **Photoswitching Efficiency Metric E()**: A normalized combination of photoswitch's absorption coefficients that helps estimate its relative speeds in response to various wavelengths.

**Important Notes:**
- Some photopharmaceuticals are not GFP-compatible, and their excitation wavelengths may cause photoisomerization or be used for imaging purposes.
- Diffusional reversibility is much slower than biological assay timescales and can be ignored in most cases. However, it's essential to consider when designing experiments using photoswitches.

#### Rapid Photoswitcher Diffusion Affects MT Assay Design and Interpretation

**Understanding Photopharmaceuticals: The Role of E(405)/E(514) Ratios and Z:ERatios in Controlling Bioactivity**

**Efficiency of Photoresponse:**
- Ratio of photoresponses to different wavelengths (e.g., 2514 nm vs. 1405 nm): E(405)/E(514)
  * Determines sensitivity and efficiency of photopharmaceutical isomerization
  * Relevant for choosing illumination wavelengths
- Importance in multi-wavelength applications: preventing unintended bioactivity

**Calculating Z:ERatios:**
- Based on known cellular concentrations needed for bioactivity
- Essential for estimating working concentrations of photopharmaceuticals
  * PST-1/PST-2 example: different Z:E ratios in various zones (85% Z, 20% Z, imaging-only areas)

**Operating Photopharmaceuticals:**
- Understanding photoisomers' behavior within cells and medium
  * Freely enter and leave cells through plasma membrane
  - Exchange between cells and medium is continuous
- Importance of anticipating pre- and post-photoswitching diffusional exchange for designing and interpreting assays.

**Wavelength Choices:**
- Affect the fractions of bioactive Zisomer in a PST-treated sample (Fig. 1c)
- Shift dose response curves predictably (Fig. 1f)

**Reproducibility and Cosolvents:**
- Establishing chosen concentration reproducibly
- Working with cosolvents and confirming final concentrations (Notes 11, 12)

**Photoisomers' Rapid Diffusion:**
- Freely enter and leave cells through plasma membrane
- Exchange between cells and medium is continuous
- Importance of anticipating pre- and post-photoswitching diffusional exchange for designing and interpreting assays.

#### Photopharmaceutical Control of Microtubule Dynamics Choosing Inhibitors and Operating Considerations

**Photopharmaceuticals and Microtubule Dynamics**

**1. Photopharmaceuticals vs. Proteins:**
- Photopharmaceuticals present both in cell and culture medium, unlike photoresponsive or fluorescent proteins
- Photoswitched compound in the medium can spread rapidly by diffusion and convection throughout sample
- Background activity increases over time due to increased levels of photoswitched compound
- Minimizing photon flux per activation phase is crucial for good results
- TIRF illumination could theoretically eliminate optical path volume above cell, allowing more photoswitching cycles

**2. Choosing Inhibitors for Photoswitching-Based Optical Control of MTs:**
- Several families of photopharmaceuticals developed to functionally analogous to colchicine: SBTubs, PSTs, STEpos, and AzTaxes
- SBTubs and related STs are the most commonly used for assays where unidirectional E.Z photoswitching is sufficient due to their high potency and minimal background activity
- PSTs are preferred for actively bidirectional (two-color) photoswitching of MT dynamics inhibition, but have less potency and may be metabolized in long-term in vivo assays
- SBTubs and related STs are highly compatible with GFP/YFP imaging, while PSTs typically require different imaging response wavelengths
- Epothilone and Taxol derivatives have enabled research applications unaccessible to destabilizers due to their differing pharmacology and spectrum of biological effects. Two classes of photopharmaceutical MT stabilizers developed: STEpos and AzTaxes.

#### Optimizing Imaging Conditions for MT Inhibitor Assays

**Photoswitchable Microtubule Inhibitors for Localized MT Dynamics Control**

**Materials:**
- Microscope with heated incubation chamber and CO2, preferably with a 360 or 405 nm laser line for photoactivation (or a 440 nm laser for specific reagents)
- Lightproof cover or black plastic for imaging chamber
- Red light lamp for working in the dark
- Brown glass vials or Eppendorf tubes for dark stocks
- Clear colorless glass vials or Eppendorf tubes for lit stocks
- DMSO (if required) and cell medium
- Photoswitchable microtubule inhibitor stock solution (adapted to photoactivation laser line) and reference inhibitor from the same drug class
- Optional: permutation control compound and commercial handheld LED at the same wavelength as your photoactivation line

**Methods:**
1. Set up imaging conditions and test reference inhibitor:
   a. Plate cells on coverslips or dishes in live cell imaging chamber or dish
   b. Transfect cells with fluorescently tagged EB1 or EB3 constructs using appropriate transfection protocols
   c. Image EB comets every 24 seconds for 5 minutes to establish baseline levels and optimize laser power and exposure settings
   d. Analyze movies using ComDet plugin to obtain comet counts per frame
2. Test cell tolerance to photoswitchable inhibitor:
   a. Prepare incubation chamber on microscope at 37C with 5% CO2
   b. Place cells in imaging chamber or dish inside incubation chamber on microscope
   c. Image EB comets while applying necessary concentrations of the photoswitchable inhibitor diluted in media (if required, use DMSO for solubility) and test cell tolerance to cosolvent
   d. If cells are not tolerant of DMSO at a certain concentration, switch to a water-soluble reagent instead
3. Test cell tolerance to UV laser line:
   a. Image EB comets while applying different intensities and exposure times of the UV laser line (if available), using a control cell in the field of view
   b. Analyze comet counts to identify a maximum total applied energy of UV light which, in combination with DMSO (if applicable), is not toxic to cells
   c. Determine the number of UV photoactivation frames/ROIs that can be applied in an experiment based on this limit.

**Additional Notes:**
- Depending on the assay readout and desired frame rate, choose a lower frame rate for more reliable results and longer experiments
- Optimize imaging settings to minimize comet bleaching over time
- Adapt photoactivation laser line to specific reagents (360 or 405 nm for SBTub, STEpo, AzTax, and PST; 440 nm for PST, AzTax, or PHTub)
- If the photoswitchable inhibitor is water-soluble (SBTubA4P, PST-1P, PST-2S), there is no need to test cell tolerance to DMSO or optimize UV laser settings.

#### Titrating Photoswitchable Reagent Concentration

**Photoswitchable Reagents: Testing and Optimization**

**Testing Reference Inhibitor**:
- Test a reference inhibitor with the same binding site as the photoswitchable reagent to confirm EB comet suppression and establish maximum effect size expectations.
- Use nocodazole or colchicine for SBTub or PST reagents; use docetaxel or paclitaxel for AzTax reagents; use epothilone D for STEpo.
- The photoswitchable pharmaceutical will never be more potent than the reference inhibitor, often less so. Without clear readout from the reference inhibitor, the assay should be stopped and reconsidered.

**Finding Working Concentration Limits and Performance**:

**Dark State Test**:
- Make room dark with red lights; dilute photoswitchable reagent through DMSO stock, prewarmed media, and apply to cells
- Image EB comets without UV light; vary drug concentration to find maximum working concentration (MWC) where dark state has no significant effect on EB comets

**Maximum Reagent Effect**:
- Illuminate 40L of 1mM DMSO stock for 1 minute in clear glass vial or eppendorf tube
- Apply MWC to cells and image to establish maximum effect that can be achieved with total photoactivation
- If not enough effects, wait and retry; if still no effects, troubleshoot (use glass vial, recheck MWC, check cosolvent solubility, switch to more potent reagent)

**Minimum Working Concentration**:
- Titrate down from lit stock by factors of 2 until minimum working concentration (MiWC) is found, where in situ-activated state gives lowest acceptable inhibition for assay needs
- Assay working concentrations should be between MiWC and MWC

**Field of View Photoswitching**:
- Apply dark drug to cells, photoactivate with 360-405nm using power settings acceptable for cells
- Titrate concentration and observe time needed for inhibition; observe cell recovery after activation
- Perform permutation control to verify no phototoxicity

**Single-Cell Photoswitching**:
- Localize photoswitching in an ROI of 10% surface area of target cell, using laser scanning or FRAP module
- Apply localized illuminations and confirm low comet bleaching rate; use same photon flux as whole-field-of-view isomerization

#### Microtubule Reassembly Assay and Fractionation for TBAs Effect Evaluation

**Immunostaining Microtubules**

**Xation and Permeabilization**:
- Performed simultaneously with organic solvents (methanol, acetone) or sequentially using crosslinking agents (formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde) followed by permeabilization using an organic solvent or a surfactant
- Choice of xating and permeabilizing agents depends on the protein to be detected by immunostaining

**Sequential Method for Microtubules**:
- Xation by formaldehyde followed by permeabilization by methanol
- Preserves intact arrays of microtubules, important for studying alterations in organization induced by tubulin-binding agents
- Surfactant-based permeabilization can lead to loss of soluble tubulin in the cytoplasm

**Studying Effects of TBAs on Cellular Microtubules**:
- Concentration and incubation time of tubulin-binding agents are crucial
- Prolonged incubation can lead to washout during staining procedures
- Short exposure may not show visible changes in microtubule organization
- **IC 50** concentration of TBAs might not lead to visible effects on microtubules
- Pilot study with at least three concentrations is recommended
- Quantification can be done using proper choice of antibody and permeabilization method

**Reassembly Assay**:

- Microtubules are extensively depolymerized, then allowed to regrow in presence of TBAs
- Two types of methods for microtubule depolymerization: physical (cold exposure) or chemical (microtubule-depolymerizing agents)
- Cold exposure decreases the polymerization rate and increases catastrophe frequency due to inactivity of tubulin-binding cofactors

**Soluble and Polymeric Tubulin Fractionation**:
- Quantification can be done by Western blot
- Soluble and polymeric tubulin fractionated using a microtubule-stabilizing buffer and glycerol to maintain integrity of polymerized tubulin during fractionation.

  * Less effective on Caco-2 MDR1 and MDR1/MRP2 knockout cells
  - Not affected by KO143, indicating they are not substrates of BCRP
- Substantially more sensitive substrate of MRP transporters for PB-GABA-Taxol compared to PB-Gly-Taxol

  * Less effective on PB-Gly-Taxol: <5-fold increase in wildtype Caco-2 cells, 3-fold in MDR1 knockout cells, <2-fold in MDR1/MRP2 knockout cells
- Uptake of these probes not affected by treatment with KO143, indicating they are not substrates of BCRP.

**Advantages:**
- Straightforward synthesis in a four pot, five step process

### Chapter 29: Controlling Cell Shape and Microtubule Organization by Extracellular Matrix Micropatterning

**Micropatterning of Extracellular Matrix Proteins**

**Background:**
- Micropatterning with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins enables defining cell position and shape in experiments studying intracellular dynamics and organization.
- Standardization is advantageous for automated and quantitative analysis, but traditional methods are cumbersome and inflexible.
- Contactless methods using a microscope-mounted UV projection system have made protein patterning more accessible and efficient.

**Materials:**

**Reagents:**
1. Poly-D-lysine hydrobromide (PDL): 1 mg/mL stock solution in sterile ultrapure water, stored frozen at -20C.
2. mPEG-Succinimidyl-Valerate (mPEG-SVA): MW-5000, store powder at room temperature and make solutions fresh when needed.
3. 100 mM K-HEPES pH 8.3: prepared by titrating HEPES free acid with KOH, sterile filtered and stored at 4C.
4. PLPP Gel photoinitiator: store at -20C in original packaging.
5. Fibronectin: 1 mg/mL stock solution, aliquoted and stored at -20C.
6. Fluorescent fibronectin.
7. Laminin: 1 mg/mL stock solution, aliquoted and stored at -20C.

**Other Materials:**
1. Glass-bottom dishes (e.g., MatTek P35G-1.5-20-C).
2. Yellow highlighter marker for Primo calibration.

**Equipment:**
1. Harrick Expanded Plasma Cleaner with vacuum pump: helps with reproducibility and troubleshooting.
2. Inverted microscope system with Primo unit: includes a Nikon Ti2 inverted microscope stand, stage-up kit for the Primo unit, a CFI S Plan Fluor ELWD 20 objective (MRH08230), and an optional hardware autofocus system.

**Technique:**
1. Clean glass-bottom dishes using plasma cleaner before use.
2. Coat with nonadhesive PEG layer, followed by UV-reactive photoinitiator to create adhesive patches.
3. Apply ECM proteins (PDL, fibronectin, laminin) to the prepared surface and wash away excess reagents.
4. Patterned areas can be visualized using a microscope or highlighter for guidance during setup.
5. Repeat process as needed to generate larger patterns by tiling individual exposures.
6. Cell culture and subsequent imaging experiments can be performed on the micropatterned surface.

#### Photopatterning Setup and Techniques for Cell Shape Control

**Primo Photopatterning System Requirements and Design Process**

**Components:**
- All peripherals supported in Micro-Manager software
- Standard Windows 10 computer with video card for two displays
  *Important:* Display power saving options turned off
- Primo DMD unit
- Micro-Manager imaging software with Leonardo plugin
- Adobe Creative Suite or similar vector- and pixel-based graphics software (e.g., Inkscape)

**Methods:**
1. **Pattern Design:**
   - Use Adobe Illustrator for drawing pattern designs, but other freeware vector graphics programs may work
   - Set measurement unit to millimeter and artboard size to 1.2 by 1.2 mm
   - Lock the black rectangle aligning with the artboard after drawing it
   - Draw white shapes for UV-exposed parts, paying attention to edge spacing for automated microscopy
   - Save as PDF or convert to TIFF using Adobe Photoshop and calculate pixel dimensions based on effective Primo DMD pixel size (0.29 m/pixel)

**Glass Surface Preparation:**
1. **Plasma Cleaning:**
   - Remove contaminants by plasma cleaning in a benchtop plasma cleaner or handheld Corona treater
   - Dry dishes completely before use and within 30 minutes for optimal surface quality
2. **PEG-SVA Coating:**
   - Prepare 200 mL (80 mL) of 0.5 mg/mL poly-D-lysine solution in 50 mM K-HEPES pH 8.3
   - Add the solution to each dish, allowing it to spread evenly on the glass surface
   - Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature
   - Dissolve 10 mg (4 mg) of mPEG-SVA in 200 mL (80 mL) of freshly prepared 50 mg/mL mPEG-SVA solution
   - Carefully remove the poly-D-lysine solution before adding the mPEG-SVA solution, avoiding contact with the glass surface
   - Incubate for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature
   - Wash dishes five times with at least 1 mL of sterile ultrapure water without touching the glass surface.

#### Micro-Patterning of PLPP Gel for Cell Shaping Experiments

**Microscopy Protocol: Coating Cover Glass with PLPP Gel for Photopatterning**

**Materials:**
- mPEG-SVA-coated dishes
- PLPP gel (3 L) and ethanol (40 L)
- Primo system
- Microscope
- Parafilm

**Procedure:**

1. **Coating with mPEG-SVA**:
   a. Dry the mPEG-SVA-coated dishes for at least 15 minutes in the biosafety cabinet.
   b. Store the wrapped dishes at 4C for up to a week before using them.

2. **Coating with PLPP Gel:**
   a. Mix 3 L (1.5 L) of PLPP gel with 40 L (20 L) of 100% ethanol in an Eppendorf tube.
   b. Gently pipette the mixture onto the center of the cover glass window without touching it.
   c. Swirl the dish evenly to spread the PLPP gel across the glass.
   d. Let the gel dry completely for at least 15 minutes with the lid ajar, protecting from light.
   e. Store the PLPP gel-coated dishes in a dark place until use.

3. **UV Photopatterning**:
   a. Turn on the microscope and Primo system, control by Leonardo plugin.
   b. Calibrate the system using a similar specimen (plasma-cleaned glass dish with highlighter) for accurate alignment.
   c. Load template with empty ROI to line up with cover glass edges.
   d. Determine UV dose (30 mJ/mm, but typically 90 mJ/mm recommended), set Stitching option for better continuity.
   e. Focus on the PLPP gel using hardware autofocus and turn off transmitted light before patterning.

#### Micropatterning Cells Using UV Patterning and Protein Coating

**UV Dose and Micropatterning**
- N108 ring-shaped patterns distributed at each UV dose
- Laser turned off before patterning, speed ~1 min/mm
- Entire area of a 20 mm glass-bottom dish covered in ~1 h
- Dishes washed extensively with sterile water (at least 5 times) after patterning

**Extracellular Matrix Coating**
- Use cell adhesion molecule of choice, with fluorescent marker for high magnification imaging
- Fibronectin:
  * Prepare 200 mL of 5 g/mL unlabeled fibronection in PBS
  * Add fluorescently labeled fibronection at a 1:10 to 1:20 ratio
  * Incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature, replace with PBS afterwards
- Laminin coating procedure similar to fibronection but use 100 g/mL laminin instead.

**Plating Cells**
- Low cell density (~25,000 cells per 20 mm dish) for RPE cells
- Replace medium after 12 hours to decrease chances of multiple cells on the same pattern spot
- Most tissue culture cells divide within 12 days
- Transfection with fluorescent marker best done before replating cells.

**Notes**
- Two versions of PLPP photoinitiator: liquid and gel form
- Liquid PLPP requires higher UV exposure dose, longer exposure times for large patterns
- PDMS stencils used for large format patterns with liquid PLPP but must protect it from drying out during UV exposure.
