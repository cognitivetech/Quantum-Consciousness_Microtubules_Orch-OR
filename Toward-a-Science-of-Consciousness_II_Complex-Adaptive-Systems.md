# Toward a Science of Consciousness II: The Second Tucson Discussions and Debates

> This book's fifteen sections demonstrate the broad range of fields now focusing on consciousness. The sections include philosophy, cognitive science, medicine, neurobiology, neural correlates, vision, sleep and dreaming, anesthesia, molecular biology and evolution, quantum theory,spacetime, hierarchical organization, and experiential approaches.
> 
> What is consciousness? Recent attempts to answer this question have motivated two interdisciplinary conferences sponsored by the University of Arizona in Tucson. The first volume of Toward a Science of Consciousness is now considered a resource book for the emerging field. This volume presents a selection of invited papers from the second conference, held in April 1996. The book's fifteen sections demonstrate the broad range of fields now focusing on consciousness. The sections include philosophy, cognitive science, medicine, neurobiology, neural correlates, vision, sleep and dreaming, anesthesia, molecular biology and evolution, quantum theory, spacetime, hierarchial organization, and experiential approaches. Each section is preceded by an overview and commentary.

## Summary

## INTRODUCTION

**Introduction:**
- William James' Principles of Psychology published in 1892
- Consciousness studies are emerging from behaviorism's ashes
- Two interdisciplinary conferences, "Toward a Science of Consciousness," held at the University of Arizona
- Book is a selection of invited papers from the second conference
- Field is interdisciplinary, with contributions from philosophers, mathematicians, computer scientists, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, neurologists, and ethnologists

**Questions in Consciousness Studies:**
- Can intimate experiences of consciousness be fully explained by neural activities?
- Is there an irreducible, fundamental property of the universe for consciousness?
- Real progress can be made through understanding different perspectives and potential misunderstandands.

**History of Interdisciplinary Efforts in Consciousness Studies:**
- Tucson I conference in 1994 filled 350-seat auditorium, moved to larger venue for Tucson II with 2200 seats
- Expanded scientific program committee with David Chalmers, Christof Koch, Marilyn Schlitz, Petra Stoerig, and Keith Sutherland
- Five major categories: Philosophy, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Mathematics and Physics, Phenomenology and Culture.
- Over 1000 "consciousness scientists" attended from 27 countries.

**Plenary Session on the Hard Problem:**
- Consensus among speakers that consciousness cannot be explained within current scientific paradigms (one exception)
- Michael Lockwood: scientific view of brain cannot account for qualia
- Jeffrey Gray: functional or structural brain features cannot explain conscious experience
- Roger Shepard and Piet Hut suggested brains may arise from consciousness instead.

#### Debate on Consciousness: Neuroscience, Philosophy, and Quantum Theory

**Bloom's Perspective on Language and Consciousness:**
- Words can motivate categorization via labeling
- Experience is not "created" by language, as abstract thought possible without words (James, Sacks)
- Prelinguistic mental life rich in deaf isolates upon learning words
- Language not essential for creating concepts, infants capable of abstract object individuation

**Transpersonal Psychology:**
- Science successful but needs reconsideration of methodological issues
- Transpersonal psychology progressed greatly in 25 years

**Conscious Vision and Primary Visual Cortex (V1):**
- Binding problem debate on bottom-up vs. top-down modulation from higher regions
- Confusion among psychologists regarding consciousness definitions: phenomenal experience (p-consciousness) vs. access (a-consciousness)

**Medicine and Consciousness:**

- Husserl tradition provides tools for studying subjective states, requires years of rigorous training
- Phenomenology of meditation practice discussed by Robert Forman
- Consciousness should be studied in its simplest form (pure consciousness event) to understand complex systems

**Current Directions in Parapsychology:**
- Susan Blackmore: former parapsychologist, skeptic of psi effects
- Ganzfeld experiments: subject identifies content observed by sender with statistical significance
- Daryl Bern: convinced ganzfeld experiments are valid after initial skepticism
- Psychokinesis (PK) experiments using random number generators show deviations from randomness
- PK effects occur even when target is randomly chosen after experiment
- Explanation may rely on quantum effects

**Functions of Consciousness:**
- V.S. Ramachandran: stroke patients with neglect and denial of own limbs
- Neglect occurs only in nondominant right hemisphere, linked to Freudian denial and repression theory
- Dan Schacter: memory, implicit memory theory

**Consciousness and the Physical World:**

- Avi Elitzur: current physics unable to discuss consciousness adequately
- Conscious experiences of different people may not move synchronously
- Alwyn Scott: consciousness emerging from all relevant levels of dynamic activity
- Need for interdisciplinary approach to consciousness studies.

## I PHENOMENOLOGY AND EPISTEMOLOGY

**I. The Problem of Consciousness in Science: An Overview**

**Background:**
- Tucson conferences aim to develop a science of consciousness
- Expanding scientific practice to include subjective mental phenomena is necessary
- Philosopher John R. Searle discusses philosophical obstacles to studying consciousness scientifically

**Mind-Body Problem**
- Divided into two problems:
  - General character of relations between consciousness and brain (easy problem, solved by two principles)
  - Explanation of how lower-level neurobiological processes cause consciousness (difficult problem, important scientific discovery)

**Importance of Studying Consciousness Scientifically:**
- Understanding various aspects of mental life, such as perception, memory, learning, pain sensations, dreams, and unconscious mental states
- Brain's special features are essential for explaining consciousness
- Progress in understanding consciousness impeded by philosophical confusions

**Philosophy vs. Science:**
- No distinct subject matters; both aim for knowledge (universal)
- Science is systematic knowledge, philosophy attempts to get us to the point where we can have systematic knowledge
- Systematic knowledge increases with systematic methods for acquiring it since the 17th century

**Philosophical Obstacles:**
- Consciousness is often considered beyond the realm of scientific investigation
- Misunderstanding the nature of philosophy and science (philosophy aims to help us acquire systematic knowledge)
- Lack of consensus on a solid framework or methodology for studying consciousness scientifically.

#### Epistemic Objectivity vs Subjectivity: Consciousness is Epistemically Subjective but Scientifically Investigable

**Challenges in Studying Consciousness with Scientific Methods**
- No clear definition of consciousness for scientific investigation (analytic vs common sense)
- Unobservable nature of consciousness leads to skepticism about its study
- Thesis 1: Consciousness is not a suitable subject for scientific investigation

**Defining Consciousness: A Common Sense Perspective**
- Refers to sentient or aware states in humans and higher mammals
- Inner, qualitative, subjective experience
- Not limited to waking state but includes dreams
- Distinct from attention, self-consciousness, and objective understanding of the term

**Objectivity vs Subjectivity Debate: Epistemic and Ontological Perspectives**
- Epistemic objectivity: Verifiable facts (Rembrandt born in 1606) vs subjective opinions
- Objective claims have no dependence on human subjects' preferences, attitudes, or prejudices
- Conscious states are ontologically subjective as they only exist through human experience.

**Thesis 2: Science cannot study consciousness due to its subjectivity**
- Misconceptions about the objective-subjective distinction in relation to consciousness
- Epistemic objectivity vs ontological subjectivity distinction should not be confused.
- Fascinating intellectual history of the objectivesubjective distinction
- Objectivity and subjectivity have different meanings, epistemically and ontologically.

#### Separating Subjective Qualia from Objective Consciousness: A Misconception

**Thesis 1: The Objective-Subjective Distinction in Science**

**Background:**
- Distinction between ontological and epistemic senses of objective-subjective
- Science is objective in the epistemic sense, seeking truths independent of investigators' opinions

**Ambiguity in Thesis 2:**
- Epistemically objective knowledge of subjective entities possible
- Requirement for scientific objectivity does not hinder investigation into ontologically subjective domains

**Thesis 2 Resolution:**
- Brain processes cause consciousness, even if we don't have a theory explaining how it happens
- Challenge for philosophers and scientists to investigate the form of this happening

**Thesis 3: Subjectivity and Objectivity in Consciousness**

**Problem Statement:**
- Difficulty connecting objective neurobiological phenomena with subjective experiences of awareness

**Approach:**
- Brain processes cause consciousness, though we don't yet have a theory explaining why or how
- Analogy to earlier unsolved problems in the history of science
- Necessity to investigate the process instead of challenging its possibility

**Thesis 4: Consciousness vs. Qualia**

**Misconception:**
- Distinction between consciousness and qualia (subjective experiences)
- Treating consciousness as an objective, third-person phenomenon with qualia as a subsidiary problem

**Counterargument:**
- Identical problem: conscious states are inherently qualitative and subjective
- Changing the subject by defining terms differently doesn't resolve the issue of accounting for our inner awareness

**Thesis 5: The Significance of Consciousness**

**Idea:**
- Consciousness may be epiphenomenal, having no causal impact on the physical world

**Counterargument:**
- Brain processes cause consciousness, even if we don't have a theory explaining why or how it influences behavior
- Surface reflections and froth on the water are caused phenomena with little impact on further effects, but consciousness plays a role in our understanding of the world.

#### Evolutionary Function of Consciousness: Not Epiphenomenal or Irrelevant

**Discussing Consciousness in Scientific Contexts**

**Thesis 1:**
- Computers performing cognitive tasks: consciousness is irrelevant, just a "luminous, purple glow"
- Conscious decisions can be explained through neurobiology (motor neurons, acetylcholine)
- Macrolevel and microlevel explanations do not imply epiphenomenon

**Answer to Thesis 1:**
- Consciousness plays a significant role in life and survival
- No valid argument has been given for its causal irrelevance

**Thesis 2:**
- Difficulty accepting consciousness as physical feature due to residual dualism
- Consciousness is an ordinary biological, physical feature (digestion or photosynthesis)
- Ontologically subjective mental feature does not make it epiphenomenal

**Answer to Thesis 2:**
- No satisfactory answer proposed for the evolutionary function of consciousness
- Imagining beings lacking consciousness irrelevant to actual causal role in real world.

**Thesis 3:**
- Evolutionary question about consciousness misunderstood due to Cartesian perspective
- Consciousness is part of the physical world, not a nonphysical phenomenon outside it.

**Answer to Thesis 3:**
- No definitive answer for the evolutionary advantage of consciousness in our world.

**Thesis 4:**
- Importance of understanding consciousness in scientific contexts:
  - Reveals fundamental confusions about consciousness and its role in reality
  - Aids in creating an adequate science of consciousness.

#### Reductionism and Emergence: Consciousness as an Emergent Property

**The Evolutionary Function of Consciousness**
- The evolutionary function of consciousness is a question that arises from considering consciousness as a biological phenomenon
- Consciousness involves activities essential for survival, such as walking, running, thinking, seeing, hearing, speaking, reproducing, raising young, organizing social groups, finding food, and avoiding danger
- The skeptical claim that consciousness serves no evolutionary function lacks force, as it does not account for the benefits of conscious awareness

**Causation and Consciousness**
- Thesis 7: If brain processes cause conscious states, then consciousness would be a separate event from the brain processes, leading to a form of dualism
- Answer to Thesis 7: Causation can involve discrete events or permanent causal forces operating through time
- Solidity and liquidity are examples of emergent properties that cannot be deduced solely from the composition and movements of their microelements
- Consciousness is also an emergent property, caused by the behavior of neurons in the brain

**Reductionism and Consciousness**
- Thesis 8: Scientific explanations are reductionist by nature, implying that consciousness is an illusion and there is nothing to it beyond neuron behavior
- Answer to Thesis 8: Reductionism is a confused concept with different interpretations in science and philosophy
- Two types of reductions: Eliminative, which gets rid of the phenomenon being reduced (e.g., heat as molecular kinetic energy), and non-eliminative, which provides a causal explanation for the phenomenon (e.g., solidity as vibratory movement of molecules in lattice structures)
- Consciousness is not eliminated by reduction to neuron behavior; it remains a higher-level feature caused by the behavior of lower-level elements

#### Consciousness as Intrinsic, Subjective Phenomenon Not Reducible to Information Processing

**Solidity and Consciousness: A Comparative Perspective**

**Solidity vs. Consciousness**:
- Solidity is a causal property of the system that cannot be eliminated through reduction to vibratory movements of molecules in lattice structures
- The pattern of facts parallels that for heat and color, but consciousness cannot be reduced in the same way due to its subjective nature
- Obsession with reductionism should be abandoned in favor of causal explanations of how brain processes cause conscious experience

**Consciousness as Information Processing**:
- Any scientific account of consciousness must involve information processing
- However, information processing is relative to the observer and cannot fully explain intrinsic features of consciousness
- Conscious states are caused by neuronal processes, realized in neuronal systems, and intrinsically inner, subjective experiences

**Avoiding Mistakes**:
- Changing the subject or not taking consciousness seriously on its own terms can lead to mistakes
- We need to focus on producing new scientific insights into how brain chemistry produces consciousness

### 2 A Science of Consciousness as If Experience Mattered Francisco J. Varela

**Purpose of Sketching a New Research Direction for Consciousness Study**
1. Reframe the approach to consciousness within cognitive science and philosophy of mind
2. Focus on human experience as the only link between mind and consciousness
3. Take phenomenology seriously as a systematic exploration of experience
4. Bridge modern science with the tradition of phenomenology (neurophenomenology)
5. Move beyond piecemeal empirical correlates or purely theoretical principles
6. Avoid neuroreductionism or eliminativism, functionalistic proposals, and pessimistic surrender

**Three Orientations in Current Consciousness Discussion**
1. **Neuroreductionism/Eliminativism (Right)**: Seeks to eliminate the pole of experience in favor of neurobiological account
2. **Functionalism (Center)**: Start from cognitive capacities, construct a theoretical framework for experiencing unity
3. **Experience-Centered Approach (Left)**: Gives explicit and central role to first-person accounts and irreducible nature of experience
   - Includes Lakoff & Johnson's cognitive semantics, Searle's ontological irreducibility, Globus' postmodern brain, Flannagan's reflective equilibrium, Chalmers' formulation of hard problem in consciousness study

**Phenomenology: Irreducible Nature of Conscious Experience**
1. Focus on irreducible nature of conscious experience as lived experience
2. Phenomenology starts from the exploration of this core concept
3. Husserl initiated Western thinking on phenomenology, which continues to develop and link with modern cognitive science (neurophenomenology)
4. Diverse contributions from Eugen Fink, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Aaron Gurwitsch, and others
5. Avoid assumptions about old-fashioned European school or limitations within personal options and styles.

#### Examining Consciousness through Phenomenological Reduction

**Phenomenology:** A Synthesis of Modern Cognitive Science and Human Experience (Synthesis of Phenomenology)
- Describes author's position as personal synthesis based on phenomenology, modern cognitive science, and other human experience focused traditions
- Defines phenomenology as reflection or attitude towards conscious capacity
- Natural attitude: assumes received claims about experiencer and objects without examination
- Goal is to establish true science of experience equal to natural sciences
- Experience contains spontaneous preunderstanding, but requires examination to free from naive beliefs (habitual understanding)

**Phenomenological Reduction (PhR): A Method for Examining Experience**
- Shift from natural attitude to phenomenological attitude: consideration of world as open and in need of exploration
- Consists of four interrelated aspects: attitude, intimacy, invariants, and training

**Aspects of Phenomenological Reduction:**
1. Attitude: reduction (bracketing): suspending beliefs about what is being examined, putting habitual discourse on hold, and focusing reflection towards the source of thoughts.
2. Intimacy: intuition: gaining intimacy with phenomenon through reduction leads to a clearer understanding and new evidence called "Aha" experience.
3. Invariants: communicating findings through language or symbolic inscriptions without losing their meaning (public descriptions).
4. Training: sustained commitment to learning and cultivating skills for attentive bracketing, intuition, and illuminating descriptions is essential for systematic study.

**Avoiding Common Misconceptions:**
- Phenomenological analysis is not introspectionism as it goes beyond mere internal examination of experience; instead, it focuses on the meaning and significance of that experience.

#### Introspective Phenomenology: Beyond Subject-Object Duality

**Phenomenology vs. Introspectionism**

**Interest in Reflexive Doubling**:
- Both phenomenology and introspectionism share an interest in the reflexive doubling as a key move of their approach to phenomena
- However, the two attitudes part company in how they use this skill

**Bracketing vs. Introspection**:
- In phenomenology, the skill is called "bracketing" and seeks to cut short uncritical introspection beliefs
- Bracketing allows for new aspects or insights into phenomena to unfold
- This move does not sustain the subject-object duality but opens into a field of phenomena where it becomes less obvious how to distinguish between subject and object

**Intuition**:
- Intuitive capacity is a basic human ability that operates constantly in daily life
- It has been widely discussed in studies of creativity
- In mathematics, intuitive evidence is convincing beyond logical chains of symbolic reasoning

**Beyond Objective-Subjective Duality**:
- Phenomenological attitude does not seek to oppose the subjective to the objective but to move beyond the split into their fundamental correlation
- Consciousness is inseparably linked to what goes beyond itself, rather than being a private internal event
- Phenomenological investigation is destined for others through intersubjective validation

**Pragmatics of Reduction**:
- Neurophenomenology is a natural solution that can move beyond the hard problem in studying consciousness
- It acknowledges a realm of practical ignorance that can be remedied
- Pragmatical elaboration on reduction, the core methodological remedy, is limited and needs further research
- Absence of phenomenologically trained individuals in the West contributes to the opacity of consciousness for science

**Neurophenomenological Circulation**:
- Recent studies have shown that the role of lived experience becomes increasingly important, even beyond first-person accounts
- This highlights the need for a disciplined approach to include immediate, direct experience in the study of mind and consciousness

#### Neurophenomenological Approach: Bridging Mind-Experience Gap through Disciplined Introspection and Research.

**Neurophenomenology: Bridging the Mind-Experiential Gap**

**Importance of Phenomenological Study:**
- Sophisticated brain imaging methods require subjects capable of making precise phenomenological distinctions and descriptions
- Temporality is inseparable from experience, with a focus on immediate time (now) and its underlying structure
  - Three-part present: nowness, past horizons (protentions), future horizons (retentions)
  - Not compatible with point-continuum representation of linear time
- Noncompressible time framework linked to long-range neuronal integration and widespread synchrony in the brain

**Neurophenomenological Approach:**
- Balanced account of both external and experiential aspects of an issue
- Emphasizes codetermination between phenomenological accounts and cognitive science
  - First-hand quality of experience provides meaning to scientific studies, while structural accounts provide constraints
- Reciprocal relationship between experience and cognitive science is typically ignored but crucial for bridging the mind-experiential gap

**Neurophenomenology vs. Identity Theory:**
- Focus on methodological grounds for examining experiential invariants, rather than philosophical commitment or assumption
- Pragmatics and learning a new method, not a priori argumentation or theoretical completeness

**Challenges of Neurophenomenology:**
1. Demand for mastering phenomenological description skills (relearning and acquisition)
2. Acceptance and integration into the research community
  - Refereed journals may view this as anathema to objectivist science but necessary extension

**Benefits of Neurophenomenology:**
- Overcoming habitual introspection to learn from experience instead of mourning potential losses
- Complementary approach to traditional cognitive science research

#### Neurophenomenology: Combining Personal Experience and Cognitive Science for Understanding Consciousness

**Science and Experience: Transformation Through Constraint**

1. **Lived, First-hand Experience**:
   - Proper field of phenomena, irreducible to anything else
   - No theoretical fix or extra ingredient in nature can bridge the gap
2. **Methodology for Exploration**:
   - Rigorous method inspired by the style of inquiry from phenomenology
   - Articulations by mutual constraints between fields revealed through experience and cognitive sciences
3. **Neurophenomenological Research Program**:
   - Seeks to understand the relationship between lived experience and scientific correlates
   - Orientation for research: Widening research community and research program inspired by phenomenology
4. **Historical Context**:
   - Contrasts with current usage of "neuro" as a nom de guerre, in contrast to neuroreductionist frameworks
   - Addresses misconceptions about Husserl's ideas from cognitive scientists and phenomenologists
5. **Key Publications**:
   - Varela (1996): Neurophenomenology: A methodological remedy for the hard problem, Journal of Consciousness Studies 3:330–349

### 3 Goodbye to Reductionism Max Velmans

**Reflexive Model of Consciousness**

**Background:**
- Current debates on consciousness: dualist vs reductionist
- Misdescriptions of experience persist despite agreement that there's a clear separation between external physical world and conscious experience
- Both dualists and reductionists agree that phenomenal world is different from res cogitans or brain states
- Reflexive model aims to understand consciousness based on accurate descriptions from first-person perspective

**Phenomenology vs Reductionism:**
- Differences in understanding pain as an example: dualist, reductionist and reflexive models have distinct views
  - Dualists: pain is nowhere (in the mind)
  - Reductionists: pain is in the brain
  - Reflexive model: pain is in the foot but a mental event
- Reflexive model assumes accurate relationship between experienced events and initiating stimuli

**Appearance-Reality Distinction:**
- Reductionism faces problem of bridging gap between conscious experiences and scientific reality
- Solution lies in accepting that all phenomenal qualities, including location and extension of perceived events, may not be the same as their underlying brain states.

#### Searle's Claim: Body Pain is a Brain State Mispresentation

**Searle's Argument Against Common Sense:**
- Searle asserts common sense is wrong based on his discovery of body representations in the brain (Penfield and Rassmussen's findings)
- Body image in somatosensory cortex: tactile mapping of body surface, different arrangements than perceived body
- No discovery of body sensations in brain, only neural excitation causing tactile sensations

**Reductionist Arguments and Fallacies:**
1. **Causation argument**: Claiming consciousness is a brain state if neural causes can be found
2. Fallacy: Ontological identity not the same as correlation or causation (symmetrical vs. asymmetrical)
3. Weakness of reductionist arguments: Few identical properties between experiences and brain states
4. Ullin Place's lightning analogy: Half true but doesn't apply to consciousness due to phenomenology
5. Patricia Churchland's theory reduction: Open to debate, fundamental problems remain even if successful

**Searle's Discoveries:**
- Body image in somatosensory cortex (SSC)
  * Tactile mapping of body surface
  * Different arrangements than perceived body
- No discovery of body sensations in brain
- Neural excitation causes tactile sensations that are subjectively located in different regions of the body.

#### Challenges to Reductionist Accounts of Consciousness and the Emergence of Nonreductionist Science of Consciousness

**Understanding Conscious Phenomena**

**Causality vs. Ontology**:
- Causality should not be confused with ontology
- John Searle's case for physicalism addressed this distinction head-on

**Bridging the Gap between Consciousness and Neuronal Activity**:
- Consciousness is caused by neuronal activity in the brain
- But it is nothing more than the higher-order, emergent effect of such activity

**Physical Macroproperties of the Brain**:
- The closest physical macroproperty to liquidity and solidity is "sponginess"
- There are also psychologically relevant macroproperties like mass action of large neuronal populations and electroencephalography

**Reductionist Accounts of Consciousness**:
- Reductionist accounts attempt to do something that cannot be done
- Examining the brain from the outside can only reveal physical causes/correlates, not consciousness itself
- Phenomenal properties of conscious experience are very different from brain states

**Nonreductionist Positions**:
- Many nonreductionist positions assume there are neural causes and correlates of conscious experiences
- Causes and correlates should not be confused with the ontology of conscious experience

### 4 What Can Mysticism Teach Us About Consciousness? Robert K. C. Forman

**Mysticism and Consciousness**

**Background:**
- Mysticism: honored in scientific community's study of consciousness
- Simple expression of human consciousness: mystics may provide insights
- Meditation or contemplation used to understand consciousness
  - Reduces mental activity
  - Inner stillness, pure consciousness event (PCE)

**The Pure Consciousness Event (PCE):**
- Occasional experience for individuals
- Defined as wakeful but contentless consciousness
- May serve as a "simple" expression of awareness in consciousness studies

**Advanced Experiences:**
- Long-term meditation leads to enlightenment
- Two quantum leaps: dualistic mystical state (DMS) and unitive mystical state (UMS)

**Mystical States and Relative Intensity:**
- Fear vs. hunger: intense thoughts consume more attention
- Cathexis inversely proportional to available consciousness
- Advanced mystical experiences result from PCEs and minimization of emotional attachments
- Unusual reports on the character of human awareness may provide useful insights into consciousness.

#### "Mystical Experiences: Pure Consciousness Events in Spiritual Traditions"

**Three Mystical Phenomena and Their Implications**

**Pure Consciousness Events (PCE)**
- Reports of mystical experience where one becomes "utterly dead to the things of the world" and suspends all thought and sensation, yet remains awake
- Example from St. Teresa of Avila: "orison of union"
  * Deprived of every feeling, even breathing
  * No thought or understanding
  - Meister Eckhart's description of rapture (gezucken)
    * Complete drawback in powers and oblivion of body and things
    * Memory, understanding, senses all cease functioning
  - Upanishads describe turiya: "restrain his mind from the external" and "continuing void of conceptions"
    * Consciousness persists as purusha or awareness itself
- Common features: absence of thought, sensation, mental objects, and perception; yet, consciousness continues to function

**Implications:**
- PCEs may be defined as a wakeful but contentless (nonintentional) experience.

#### Phenomena of Unbroken Continuity and Dualistic Silence in Mystical States.

**Implications from PCE about Human Consciousness**

**1. Universal Experience:**
- Pattern seen across cultures and eras
- Suggests commonality in experiences available to various cultural contexts (Clark, Buchanan)

**2. Consciousness Beyond Perception:**
- Reports suggest consciousness can persist without perception or thought
- Challenges definition of consciousness as an epiphenomenon
- Independence from binding problem

**3. Awareness vs. Consciousness:**
- Distinction between awareness and consciousness (Deikman, Chalmers)
- PCE implies humans can directly recall self-awareness through intuitively knowing it has persisted

**4. Direct Self-Recollection:**
- Presence to oneself distinct from presence to objects or perceptions
- Lonergan's distinction: conscious presence vs consciousness of consciousness (McCarthy)

**5. Permanent Interior Silence:**
- Dualistic pattern: silent interiors become a permanent development for some practitioners
- Roberts and Neo-Advaitan report describing this state as devoid of intellectual self-reflection but with full cognizance of their own silent awareness while active.

#### Dualistic Mystical State: Silent Awareness Expanding Beyond Physical Self

**Dualistic Mystical State (DMS)**

**Characteristics of DMS:**
- Sense of interior silence at one's core
- Awareness experienced as silent and separate from intentional content
- Gradual expansion of self beyond physical frame
- Oceanic or unbounded feeling
- Permanent or semipermanent basis

**Experience of DMS:**
1. Interior silence grows larger, expanding to permeate the entire body
2. Awareness feels as if it extends beyond the physical self
3. Sense of union with a higher power or God (optional)

**Relation to Theism:**
- Association with God is plausible for some individuals experiencing DMS
- Permanent filling of soul with Lord equates to an expansive and silent presence within

**Comparisons:**
1. Walt Whitman's oceanic feeling: similar ineffability and expanded quality
2. St. Teresa's Spiritual Marriage: permanent union with God resulting in silence and expansion.

#### Exploring Mystical Experiences: Unity and Awareness Beyond the Body

**Mystical Experiences and Consciousness**

**Interior Silence and Expanded Awareness:**
- Can be experienced as expanded or more spacious than one's body (Freud's "oceanic feeling")
- Suggests consciousness may not be limited to the physical body
- Fieldlike, non-localized awareness interacts with the brain
- Mystics have ability to become aware of their own awareness permanently or semipermanently
- Consciousness might be a field transcending individual brain cells and the entire brain

**Unitive Mystical State:**
- Sense of unity with external objects (Malwida von Meysenburg, Starbuck)
- Membranes of experienced self become semipermeable
- Connectedness with things in nature
- Can be temporary or permanent
- Similar to Plotinus' description of Nirvana or Hindu term for enlightened one (jivanmukti)
- Bernadette Roberts' experience: watching a seagull, no division between self and object.

#### Unitive Experiences in Mysticism: Awareness, Field-like Perception and Transcendence

**Unitive Mystical States and Consciousness**

**Implications of Unitive Experiences:**
- Suggests consciousness is like a field (immanent and transcendent)
- Perception of unity may indicate connection to all objects, even self and others
- Some individuals may be genetically or temperamentally predisposed to mystical ability

**Unitive Experiences vs. Ordinary Awareness:**
- Distinction between awareness per se and functional processes of sensation and thought
- Suggests consciousness is not a side effect of material processes but a dualism with the brain
- Field-like character of awareness, transcending individual boundaries

**Mystical Experiences: Phenomenology vs. Science:**
- Phenomenology offers various explanations for mystical experiences
- Validity of mystical reports should not be dismissed without compelling reasons
- Evidence suggests a distinction between consciousness and the brain.

**Unitive States and Consciousness (continued):**
- Mystics report an expanded sense of self that permeates objects in the world
- Suggests consciousness may be common to all things, including nonhuman entities
- Uncertain if consciousness of these entities is self-reflective or not.

**Unitive States and Meditation:**
- Not everyone who meditates experiences unitive states
- Some individuals may be genetically or temperamentally predisposed to mystical ability.

**Conclusion:**
- Unitive experiences point towards a distinction between awareness per se and functional processes of sensation and thought
- Awareness may have nonlocalized, quasispatial character like a field
- Transcendental nature of this field may be similar to energy fields in physics.

#### Exploring the Nature and Locations of Consciousness in Mysticism.

**Theories and Research on Consciousness:**
- Bernadette Roberts' experience challenges William James' belief in transient mysticism (18)
- Parallels between awareness transformation and rapid shifting of physical systems (20, 23)

- Transient vs. permanent sense of presence or expansive consciousness (25, 26, 28)
- Non-locality of mind and interaction with fine particles (Buchanan, March 9, 1996; Forman, forthcoming).

### 5 Reductionism Revisited Alwyn C. Scott

**Reductionism Revisited by Alwyn C. Scott**

**The Reductive Materialist Perspective:**
- Belief that dynamics throughout the universe are governed by fundamental fields and particles of physics
- A "theory of everything" guides evolution, sometimes called "mind of God"

**Positive Aspects of Reductionism:**
- Encourages understanding relationships between natural phenomena
- Reliable knowledge is potentially useful
- Success in areas like mechanics, electromagnetism, and gravity lead to modern technology

**Limitations of Reductionism:**
- Belief that all intricate phenomena can be reduced requires examination
- Three examples: television sets, Bosnia crisis, life vs consciousness

**Television Sets:**
- Simple mechanical system understood through electromagnetic equations and voltage/current relations
- Reductive perspective works well for this level of description

**Bosnia Crisis:**
- Complex political dynamics beyond the purview of reductionism
- Human emotions and ethical considerations cannot be explained by equations

**Science vs Humanities Education:**
- Scientists conditioned to believe all problems can be reduced, philosophers follow suit
- Humanists deal with ambiguities and impossible-to-quantify questions like ethics and esthetics

**Life: Schrödinger's Question**
- Erwin Schrödinger's "What is Life?" (1944) introduced molecular biology
- Life at cellular level more ornate than anything in physics, not reducible to ordinary laws of physics.

**Life: What is Life? by Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan**
- Traces life's development on Earth from bacteria to animals and plants
- Evolution dominated by bacterial cells until emergence of eukaryotic cells with meiotic sex and programmed death.

#### Evolutionary Impact of Conscious Choice on Species Survival

**The Myriad Species of Life on Earth**
- The five kingdoms of life interact in an intricate and robust equilibrium
- Maintain Earth's atmospheric oxygen near 21% and potentially help regulate temperature
- Symbiotic merging of bacteria led to the first eukaryotes with membrane-bound nuclei and mitochondria

**Genetic Reductionism vs. Life**
- Perspective of genetic reductionism may not suffice to comprehend life
- Intricate system with uncounted feedback loops and hierarchical levels of organization
- Nonlinear dynamics make it difficult to predict or understand

**The Essence of Life: A Single Organism**
- Bacteria's DNA codes for hundreds of protein molecules, each a dynamic system vital for life
- Proteins serve various functions such as biochemical cycles, food/waste flow, and flagellum movement
- Interwoven cycles of activity at different organizational levels

**Autopoiesis: The Self-Maker and Poet**
- Bacterium produces itself through autopoietic processes
- Suspension that genetic reductionism may miss essential features of life

**The Hypercycle: A Principle of Natural Self-Organization**
- Life organized as cycles within cycles within cycles to form hierarchical hypercycles
- Dynamic activity at each level interacts with others, governed by integrodifferential equations
- Difficult to study numerically due to differing time and space scales across levels

**Life vs. Consciousness: Intertwined Phenomena?**
- Few deny humans can influence the biosphere through conscious decisions
- Schrödinger's "feigned Lamarkism": Conscious choice can alter evolutionary development
- Change in behavior favors chance mutations, increasing survival chances for the offspring

**The Future of Understanding Life**
- Ongoing efforts by molecular biologists to formulate equations of life
- Nonlinear processes make understanding life's global properties extremely challenging

#### Evolution and Consciousness: Bridging Reductive Science and Psychic Reality

**Schrodinger's Feigned Lamarkism:**
- Nonlinear interactions between chance mutations and elective behaviors can influence life's history
- Evolutionary role of consciousness becomes important with the ability to choose behaviors
- Introduction of free will, consciousness, and culture accelerates complexity on Earth

**Computer Functionalism:**
- Merely a theory of the mind
- Fails to capture essential aspects of subjective experiences
- Many find it surprising and disturbing due to cultural assumptions of reductive science

**Limitations of Computer Functionalism:**
- Insufficient for describing human life phenomena
- Modifications may be needed to accommodate psychic reality
- More effort required to enlarge the reductive paradigm

**Progress Towards Understanding Consciousness:**
- Less academic territoriality and more openness to unfamiliar ideas
- Listen, learn, and find areas of agreement between different perspectives
- Evolution of life makes effective uses of symbiosis
- Search for a collective understanding of consciousness as an interacting spectrum of phenomena
- Reach from biochemistry to neural network theory, psychology, culture, and the human spirit.

## II ONTOLOGY, THE HARD PROBLEM OF EXPERIENCE, FREE WILL, AND AGENCY

**Phenomenal Consciousness and Subjective Experience**
- Hardest questions about consciousness concern **phenomenal consciousness**, or subjective experience
- Distinctions between different senses of "consciousness":
  - Access consciousness vs. phenomenal consciousness (Block, 1995)
  - Awareness vs. experience (Chalmers, 1995)
  - Phenomenality, intentionality, and introspectability (Nelkin, 1993)
  - Higher-order, discriminatory, responsive, and phenomenal consciousness (Tye, 1996)

**Epistemology of Consciousness**
- Knowledge of consciousness is differently from knowledge in other domains:
  - Less intersubjective than physical world knowledge
  - Important data gathered through first-person experience
  - Not straightforwardly accessible by others

**Explanatory Problem of Phenomenal Consciousness**
- **Hard problem**: Explaining why cognitive and behavioral functions are accompanied by conscious experience (unlike the "easy problems")
- Solutions may require new methods, different from those used for performing functions

**Boundary Problem of Consciousness**
- Consciousness seems to have inherent physical boundaries, unlike the rest of the physical world
- Challenges the idea that consciousness is a physical phenomenon

**Panpsychism and Other Ontological Approaches to Consciousness**
- Panpsychism: Experience found at all levels of the physical world
  - Embraced by some as a solution to hard problem and boundary problem
- Farleigh's "event ontology" and Shepard & Hut's "turning the hard problem upside down"
- Mangan's suggestion to view consciousness as a medium for information

**Zombies and the Incoherence of Non-Conscious Agents**
- Zombies: Physical/functional identical humans with no conscious experience
  - Raised as a challenge to anti-reductionist arguments
- Thomas's argument against zombies, focusing on their supposed claims to consciousness

**Embracing Folk Psychology Concepts in Understanding Consciousness**
- Hodgson's defense of the ontology of "folk psychology" concepts
  - Important for understanding guilt and human rights in law.

### 6 The Enigma of Sentience Michael Lockwood

**The Enigma of Sentience**

**Sentience**:
- Term used synonymously with consciousness
- Refers to a primal, basic feeling or experience that even the lowliest organisms exhibit when prodded or exposed to heat
- Seems to confer an adaptive advantage for creatures possessing it

**Challenges in Understanding Sentience**:
- The fact that consciousness exists challenges current theories of the material world
- Consciousness does not seem to fit neatly into the increasingly coherent and satisfying understanding of physics, chemistry, and biology
- Attempts to correlate conscious states with neurophysiological processes may not shed light on the true nature of consciousness

**Importance of Studying Sentience**:
- Empirical investigation of consciousness has made significant strides in recent years
- Research on phenomena like blindsight and perceptual binding have provided new insights into attention and short-term memory
- Neuroscience may eventually build a psychophysical lexicon to systematically pair conscious states with their neurophysiological correlates

**The Enigma Remains**:
- Even if the neural mechanisms underlying sentience are fully understood, it does not explain why these physical events have subjective correlates
- The "deep problem" remains as to why consciousness arises from the physical processes of the brain

#### Consciousness as an Irreducible, Meaningful, Unified Phenomenon Resistant to Materialist Explanation.

**The Problem of Consciousness in Physical Science**

**Psychophysical Correlations**:
- Laboriously established, but "utterly incomprehensible" in terms of current understanding
- Seem to defy the spirit of physical science, as they depend on organic complexity

**The Uncertainty of Brain Explanation**:
- Presumably, we could explain behavior without referring to conscious states
- But this leaves consciousness "in the cold," a causal irrelevance

**Conscious States as a Subset of Neurophysiological States**:
- The identity theory suggests that conscious states are just a subset of neurophysiological states, not explicitly recognized
- But this is problematic because conscious states have features difficult to accommodate within the current scientific conception of the material world

**Qualia and Phenomenal Qualities**:
- Qualia are "phenomenal qualities" that cannot be explained by the physical properties of subatomic particles
- They are not an illusion, as they are a feature of perceptual representation, not just a representation
- Meaning, or intentionality, also arises from consciousness

**The Unity of Consciousness**:
- Unlike the material world, the unity of consciousness seems to be "all-or-nothing"
- This is difficult to reconcile with the materialist view that consciousness is just a physical process

**Philosophical Strategies to Reconcile Consciousness and Physical Science**:
- Central state materialism, functionalism, eliminative materialism, heterophenomenological approach
- The author sees these as "ultimately futile exercises in intellectual contortionism"

**The Problem of Knowing the Physical World**:
- The conceptual edifice we bring to bear on the external world is essentially formal and lacks explicit content
- Understanding in physics is limited, while our common-sense conception of the material world is filled with features drawn from perception and introspection.

#### Exploring Mind-Brain Identity Theory and Representation in Consciousness

**Idea of Isomorphism between Consciousness and External World**

**Wittgenstein's Example**:
- Patterns of marks in a printed musical score, musician's motions, sound waves, and bakelite disk grooves all embody the same information but are disparate physical realities.
- We can only know the nature of the external world through conscious perception, which reveals an isomorphism with internal impressions.

**Limited Knowledge of Physical World**:
- Consciousness offers insight into the intrinsic character of material world, not just causal structure.
- The idea was expressed by Bertrand Russell as "Russellian materialism."

**Problems with Russellian Materialism**:
- **Grain problem**: Reconciling qualitative diversity in subjective experience with the physical sciences' description of brain matter.
- Difficulty in construing conscious states as perspectives on, yet embedded in, corresponding brain states.

**Insight from Analogy**:
- Patterns in a block of wood cut along different planes offer multiple views but are present within the material.
- Consciousness offers an "insider's look" at brain activity, not just a depiction.

**Physical System and Degrees of Freedom**:
- A physical system is defined by its degrees of freedom, which can be unfamiliar to non-physicists.
- Mind seems to elude ordinary categories; equating mind with a subsystem in the brain that has specific mentalist degrees of freedom may offer a materialist perspective.
- Consciousness may be associated with a specific representation of this subsystem.

#### Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness: Potential Connection and Implications for Physical Models

**Theoretical Proposal for Consciousness in Quantum Mechanics**

**Background:**
- Representations in quantum mechanics correspond to complete sets of compatible observables (maximal information about physical systems)
- Qualia may be intrinsic realities corresponding to occupied points within an n-dimensional quality space, defined by n-tuples of simultaneously realizable eigenvalues of a set of n compatible observables on the relevant subsystem of the brain.

**Proposal:**
1. Consciousness is the intrinsic reality corresponding to a set of simultaneous eigenvalues of some subset of a complete set of compatible observables in the consciousness representation of a physical system, such as the human brain.
2. The language of quantum mechanics provides a scientific way to conceptualize nature, including consciousness, without prejudice towards quantum-mechanical properties or wave function collapse.
3. Classical mechanics is sufficient for predicting practical trajectories but does not capture the underlying physical reality.
4. Consciousness can be seen as an "active light" that plays over an inner arena of qualia (sensing and conceptualization).
5. Meaning may be associated with this light or built into the system, similar to medieval philosophical ideas.
6. Unity within physical world: collective states in quantum mechanics, such as superconductivity and laser light, could potentially embody the unity required for consciousness. Penrose's suggestion of a possible relation between awareness and coherent quantum states in the brain is intriguing.
7. Adaptive value: nature may utilize quantum computation in the brain due to its potential for faster processing through parallelism, despite limitations on extracted information.

**Related Research:**
- Walker (1970) suggested a possible connection between consciousness and quantum mechanics
- Marshall's idea of basing a physical model of consciousness on a pumped phonon system in the brain
- Recent growth in applying quantum mechanics to understand consciousness
- Shor’s discovery of a quantum computational algorithm for factoring large numbers quickly.

#### Quantum Coherence and Consciousness Discussion in Neuroscience.

**Quantum Coherence in Consciousness Debate**

**Background:**
- Discovery of algorithms for determining global properties of Boolean functions faster than conventional computers
- Possible application to pattern recognition and quantum computation

**Criticisms:**
1. Speculative nature of the idea
2. Questionable feasibility of creating and sustaining coherence in large regions of the brain
3. Uncertainty about the actual locus of consciousness
4. Large-scale processing may not require a large area of the brain

**Evidence:**
1. Weiskrantz's attempt to locate visual systems active only during conscious experience
2. Possible simplicity of sentience despite complex physical arrangements required for its creation, sustainment, and utilization
3. Coherence in biological systems proposed by Frohlich
4. Global stimulus properties reflected through intercolumnar synchronization in cat visual cortex (Gray et al., 1989)
5. Attempts to ground consciousness in quantum coherence (Bennett, 1993; Penrose, 1987; Russell, 1927)

**Arguments for Small Locus:**
- Anatomical requirements: widespread afference, efference, direct and robust efference to motor systems, sensitivity to small lesions (Bogen)
- Intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus as potential candidates for anatomical locus of consciousness.

### 7 The Myth of Double Transduction Daniel C. Dennett

**The Myth of Double Transduction**

**Daniel C. Dennett's Perspective**:
- The author is skeptical about the need for scientific revolutions to explain consciousness
- He sees himself as a conservative, believing that ordinary normal science can explain consciousness
- Recalls being a "good cop" at Woodstock, where he encouraged people to enjoy themselves without causing harm

**The Problem of Consciousness**:
- The idea is that conscious observation involves a special sort of transduction (observation) in the brain
- This leads to the belief that there is a privileged medium in the brain where consciousness occurs, often referred to as "Cartesian Materialism"
- Critics argue that this idea is redundant, as all features of conscious experience are already being processed by different areas of the brain

**The Concept of Transduction**:
- Transduction refers to the conversion of energy or information from one form to another
- There are both artificial (e.g., photocells) and natural (e.g., rods and cones in the retina) transducers
- The temptation is to view conscious observation as a special sort of transduction

**The Problem with Conscious Transduction**:
- Simply saying "Red light" does not necessarily indicate that someone is conscious of seeing the light
- A person's unconscious responses (e.g., pressing the brake pedal in response to a stoplight) do not imply consciousness
- The idea that there is a special late transduction event occurring in the brain may be an illusion, as the patterns of activity in early visual areas seem distorted and unlike conscious experience

#### Distributed Consciousness Theory: Emotional Processing and Decision-Making are not Limited to Central Brain Centers

**Cartesian Theater vs. Distributed Consciousness**

**Empirical Fact:**
- No Cartesian Theater in human brain
- Distribution of work in both space and time within the brain is agreed upon by researchers

**Conceptual Point:**
1. Rejection of Cartesian Theater as central control center
2. Work includes emotional reactions, appreciation of scenes, pattern recognition, etc.
3. Consciousness distributed in time, not just space (not a building process)
4. Mistake to assume consciousness has an onset measurable to the millisecond
5. The Battle of New Orleans: news of truce signing took weeks to spread across British Empire
6. British Empire as a legal entity: when did it learn about signing of treaty?
7. Date of recognition cannot be specified more finely than several weeks.

**Implications:**
- Consciousness not limited by millisecond onset
- Work distributed in time, not just space within the brain.

#### Neuroscientific Arguments Against Dualism: Consciousness as Network Activity

**Understanding Consciousness and the Brain**

**Plausibility of London as Empire Headquarters**:
- Identifying a specific subregion of the brain as "headquarters" is implausible
- George III's learning was not decisive in determining when consciousness occurred

**Limitations of Identifying a Specific Subregion**:
- Jeffrey Gray's "subicular comparator" was an important crossroads, but effects required coordination with other brain regions
- Consciousness cannot be arbitrarily attributed to any one stage in the process

**The Dilemma of Consciousness Transduction**:
- Modern systems can transmit information media neutrally between "Boss" and rudder
- However, this does not apply to nerve impulses in the nervous system
- Some argue we need a central agent or audience for all that information, leading to the idea of a second transduction

**Alternative View: Consciousness as Network Activity**:
- The network itself can assume roles of an inner "Boss" and harbor consciousness
- This view is not readily accepted by some due to the idea of a separate subjective point of view
- The author argues that what one is is the organization of all competitive brain activities, and consciousness is the product of solving the "easy problems"

### 8 Brainshy: Nonneural Theories of Conscious Experience Patricia Smith Churchland

**Brainshy: Nonneural Theories of Conscious Experience**

**Understanding the Mind/Brain**:
- Difficult due to conceptual or theoretical obstacles
- Limited availability of suitable techniques
- Practical difficulties in performing experiments
- Motivated by the idea that consciousness is not a neural matter

**Three Variations on Nonneural Theories**:
1. **Consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe based on information**: David Chalmers' approach
2. **Consciousness as an unexplainable, intrinsic property**: John Searle's argument
3. **Consciousness as a property arising from quantum-level phenomena**: Roger Penrose's hypothesis

**Evaluation of the Three Theories**:
1. Chalmers' approach:
   - Conceptualizing a problem is crucial for solution discovery
   - Focuses on whether consciousness can be understood without neuroscience
2. Searle's argument:
   - Consciousness appears to be unexplainable in terms of brain properties
3. Penrose's hypothesis:
   - Based on quantum-level phenomena below the neuron level
   - Lacks empirical evidence to merit serious research investment

**Evaluation of "The Hard Problem"**:
- The term "Hard Problem" is used to divide consciousness from other neuroscientific problems
- This division is based on thought experiments, which are open to question
- The argument for an independent understanding of consciousness versus other phenomena lacks evidence
- The definition and boundaries of consciousness are not well-defined enough to support this fundamental empirical principle.

#### Reflection on the Limits of Understanding Consciousness and Sensorimotor Control in Neuroscience.

**Easy vs. Hard Problems in Consciousness**

**The Easy Problem**:
- No understanding of solutions for so-called "easy" problems (sensorimotor control, attention, short-term memory, long-term memory)
- Lack of comprehensive theory to explain these phenomena
- Genuine and deep puzzles that require further investigation

**The Hard Problem**:
- Prototypical cases of conscious experiences provide a starting point but do not fully define the class
- Troublesome questions about fuzzy boundaries, connections between attention, short-term memory, and awareness persist
- The idea that consciousness requires a "humdinger" solution is a misconception, as little is understood about the problem or its potential solutions

**Argumentum Ad Ignorantiam**:
- Drawing substantive conclusions from scientific ignorance is a fallacy
- Lack of evidence for something is just that: lack of evidence
- The temptation to suppose ignorance indicates "depth" or metaphysical significance should be resisted

#### Searle's Critique of Neuroscience's Limitations in Understanding Consciousness

**Neuroscience and Consciousness: Limitations of Understanding**

**Argument from Ignorance**
- Conclusion that attention, sensorimotor integration, or consciousness are mysterious is based on current scientific limitations
- This conclusion is not glamorous but represents the truth about our understanding
- Neuroscience has not yet reached the progress of molecular biology in understanding hereditary transmission

**The Problem of Mysteriousness**
- Mysteriousness of a problem is an epistemological fact, not a metaphysical feature of reality
- It is about our current scientific knowledge and imagination, not objective truths about the phenomenon itself
- Argument from ignorance fallacy: "we cannot now explain" does not imply "we can never explain"

**Limitations of "I Can't Imagine" Gambit**
- Imagining an explanation for a problem is open-ended and under-specified
- This flexibility makes it difficult to distinguish between solvable problems and unsolvable ones
- To make meaningful distinctions, more detail is required in the argument

**Lessons from History of Science**
- Assessing relative difficulty or tractability of scientific problems can be challenging from a position of ignorance
- Guesswork should be qualified and tentative; learning science and doing research are essential for progress

**John Searle's View on Neuroscience and Consciousness**
- Believes that a fundamental change in science is needed to understand conscious experience
- Advocates learning the science and doing the research instead of relying on intuitions about what problems are solvable.

#### Searle's Ontological Distinctness Argument for Conscious Experience

**Searle's View on Consciousness:**
- Brain causes conscious states, but they are not explainable in terms of brain states (ontologically distinct)
- Conscious experience is a fundamental feature of the universe
- Searle's argument based on ontology: appearance = reality for consciousness
  - Observable properties can be taken beyond with scientific discoveries
  - Light example: refraction is observable, but light is electromagnetic radiation (unobservable)
- Reductionism misconceptions from Searle's perspective
  - Conscious states not eliminated by neurobiological explanations
  - Reconfiguration vs. denial of phenomena
- Distinction between reality and understanding of the nature of the world
- No denial of consciousness existence, only potential conceptual reconfigurations.

#### Exploring Quantum Gravity's Role in Consciousness: A Critique of Penrose and Hameroff's Theory

**Philosophers' Expectations about Pain and Searle's Hypothesis:**
- Some philosophers believe the difference between feeling pain by oneself vs. observing another person experiencing it is unreal or nonexistent based on neurobiological states.
- This hypothesis, which may include Searle, is considered silly due to a faulty scenario where one's neural activity causes pain in others.
- However, this does not necessarily follow from the hypothesis that pains are physical states of the brain.
- Subjectivity is determined by whose brain is in the appropriate state, and observing someone else's neuronal activity doesn't produce the same effect as having it within oneself.

**Penrose and Hameroff's Approach:**
- Believe consciousness cannot be fully explained neurobiologically due to quantum events in microtubules within neurons.
- Reason for this belief is that mathematical understanding transcends what neurons can achieve, and unique operations at the quantum level are required.
- Hypothesis involves quantum gravity and microtubules as they have the right size and sensitivity to anesthetics to support consciousness.

**Critique of Penrose and Hameroff's Theory:**
- Lack of hard evidence, testability, or clear explanation for several aspects of their theory.
- Debate among mathematical logicians on what the Gödel result implies for brain function and its connection to conscious experiences.
- Obscure link between loss of consciousness under anesthesia and microtubules' quantum coherence.
- Uncertainty regarding how quantum effects in microtubules can explain various phenomena of conscious experience like recall, filling in the blindspot, hallucinations, and attentional effects on sensory awareness.

#### Criticizing Origins of Consciousness Theories, Emphasizing Need for Experimentation and Theory Development

**Conclusions and Thoughts:**
- Consciousness may not be as tractable a problem as other neural functions (e.g., timing)
- Thought experiments can be underdeveloped, lacking scientific basis
- Quantum coherence in microtubules is a possible explanation for consciousness but lacks convincing evidence
- Continue with experimental psychology and neuroscience research on consciousness

#### The role of philosophy in understanding mind-brain relationship and its cooperation with other sciences.

**Neurophilosophy: Toward a Unified Science of the Mind-Brain**

**Overview:**
- Book by P.S. Churchland exploring the role of neuroscience in understanding the mind
- McGinn's review raises concerns about the relevance of empirical data in psychology and intuitive convictions

**McGinn's Critique:**
- Believes intuitive psychology is an "autonomous mode" and shielded from empirical investigation
- Rejects idea that our understanding of the mind might be reassessed through neuroscience research

**Churchland's Response:**
- Brain is responsible for perception, thinking, feeling; studying its components essential to understand mind
- Psychology provides constraints and helps specify functions to be explained by neural networks
- Modeling necessary due to properties at the level of circuits not determined by single cell analysis
- Co-evolution of theories at all levels essential for productive research ideology
- Philosophy is synoptic discipline, attempting to synthesize existing sciences into a unified account

**McGinn's Response:**
- Finds Churchland's conception of philosophy "absurd" and wants to keep it free from empirical science
- Believes in the analysis of concepts but finds collaboration with other disciplines insular and delusional

**Additional Information:**
- Kenneth Craik called for an "experimental philosophy" of mind in 1943
- Best research by contemporary philosophers is richly cross-disciplinary
- A willingness to cooperate and exchange ideas is a healthy development in understanding the universe and ourselves.

### 9 Whitehead's Even More Dangerous Idea Peter Farleigh

**Whitehead's Idea in Philosophy and Science**

**Introduction to Whitehead's Event Ontology:**
- Rejected Cartesian dualism fully (1929, Process and Reality)
- Events as fundamental units instead of matter or information processing
- Unity between observer and observed, subject and object
- Displaces the concept of machine with organism in understanding the world

**Background:**
- Dualists, materialists, functionalists, eliminativists share uncritical acceptance of Cartesian image of matter
- Whitehead offers an alternative perspective through event thinking

**Event Thinking vs. Substance Thinking:**
- Events: happenings in certain places and times (everything from autumn leaf to Roman Empire)
- Limited approach using concepts of matter in motion is insufficient for understanding the general view
- Russell's conversion to Whiteheadian event philosophy (1914)

**Whitehead's Actual Occasions:**
- Fundamental unit events at all levels in nature: subatomic, atomic, molecular, cellular, human perception
- Complex high-grade events include moments of human perception or "percipient events"
- Consciousness role: explicit awareness of a present situation's potential otherness.

**Implications:**
- Dangerous idea displacing traditional perspectives on understanding the world.

#### Exploring Whitehead's Concept of Prehension in Perception and Memory

**Panpsychism vs. Panexperientialism**
- Panpsychism: term used to describe Whitehead's position, not one he used himself
- Can be problematic as it implies that all things have some consciousness or mentality, which is not true
- David Ray Griffin suggests "panexperientialism" as a more appropriate term
- Not all characteristics of mentality observed at macroscale are evident at microscale
- Atoms in a sponge are not themselves spongy; mechanistic analogies useful for ordinary matter

**Actual Occasions and Their Nature**
- Whitehead's concept of actual occasions: momentary, independent, self-contained events that make up reality
- Human experience is an example of an actual occasion
- Highly coordinated societies of low-level occasions (e.g., perception) form higher-level events

**Prehension and Intentionality**
- Whitehead's concept of prehension: experiencing, perceiving, or taking account of something, whether consciously or not
- Prehension exists at all levels of nature, from single cells to subatomic events
- Similarities with intentionality: both describe the relationship between a subject and an object, but prehension is extended beyond human consciousness.

**Prehension vs. Intentionality**
- Both affirm doctrine of internal relations
- Prehension solves causation problem through asymmetrical relations between present event and its past.

#### Whitehead's Theory: Events as Matter-Mind Relational Entities

**Comparison between Prehension and Intentionality (Gier 1976)**

**Prehension**:
- Unifies both phenomenology and science
- Generalizes intentionality and causality
- Present moment is tinged with possibilities for future events
- Requires creative response or choice, which may or may not be conscious
- Subjective aim of the occasion: anticipation of conceptual possibilities for succeeding event

**Causation in Whitehead's Theory**:
- Future event cannot be physical cause of present event (no backward causation)
- Present event can be partly determined by anticipation of future possibilities
- Degree of freedom within a causal chain: measure of flexibility
  - Extremely small at subatomic level
  - Large degree at human level
- If degree of freedom is zero, the causal chain is completely deterministic

**Conclusion**:
- Changing mode of thinking from substances to events is dangerous
  - Rejects Cartesian images of mind and matter as separate
  - Both concepts are replaced by the single concept of relational events
- Whitehead's theory avoids pitfalls of dualism, materialism, and functionalism
- Worthy of serious consideration in contemporary debate.

### 10 Against Functionalism: Consciousness as an Information-Bearing Medium Bruce Mangan

**Consciousness as an Information-Bearing Medium**

**Two Questions about Information-Bearing Media**:
- What information does the medium bear?
- In what specific way does the medium bear its information?

**Distinction between Genus and Species**:
- The first question identifies the genus of information-bearing media
- The second question identifies the distinct species within that genus

**Consciousness as a Distinct Information-Bearing Medium Species**:
- There are reasons to think consciousness is a distinct species of information-bearing medium
- This contrasts with functionalist theories, which claim consciousness can be instantiated in any medium

**Medium-Specific vs. Medium-Independent Research**:
- **Medium-specific research**: Understanding the specific information-bearing medium (e.g., rhodopsin in the rods of the eye)
- **Medium-independent research**: Findings that can be realized in various media (e.g., vision as a function of converting photons into useful information)

**Limitations of Functionalism**:
- Cannot account for the specificity of how consciousness is instantiated as a medium
- Contradicts the concept of medium specificity, which suggests information cannot be fully realized by different media

#### Consciousness as Medium: A Plausible Alternative to Functionalism

**Functionalism vs. Consciousness as an Information-Bearing Medium**

**Functionalists' Assumptions**:
- Functionalists tacitly assume that consciousness is a medium-independent entity

**Antifunctionalists' Assumptions**:
- Many antifunctionalists tacitly assume that consciousness is a specific medium

**Neutralizing the Dispute**:
- The debate can be made neutral and scientifically grounded by avoiding references to qualia

**Dennett's Stance**:
- Dennett's arguments do not directly address the medium hypothesis
- Dennett equates consciousness with vision, not light, as a distinct content system

**Medium Hypothesis as a Plausible Alternative**:
- The medium hypothesis is scientifically plausible, not just logically possible
- It can explain why people are uneasy about functionalism's wide range of entities considered "conscious"
- It aligns with the finding that consciousness operates on a narrow bandwidth compared to neural structures in the brain

**Importance of Medium-Specific Research**:
- Functionalism fails if it denies that consciousness is a distinct information-bearing medium
- Medium-specific research is important and should not be overlooked in favor of functional analysis alone.

#### Exploring the Distinct Medium Hypothesis for Conscious Experience and its Implications

**Medium Hypothesis of Cognition**

**Plausible Explanation for Correlation between Cognitive Functions and Narrow Bandwidth**:
- Certain subset of cognitive functions correlate with narrow bandwidth
- Discussed by many people, cluster around: access, reporting, monitoring, novelty evaluation, executive function
- Possible explanation: these functions load heavily on a distinct, narrow bandwidth medium separate from neural medium's wide bandwidth (indicates different operations)

**Empirical Evidence for Distinct Cognitive Medium**:
- Objective evidence of narrow bandwidth medium associated with attention and subjective experience
- Suggests narrow phenomenology reflects conscious experience or qualia
- Coincidental correlation between two different but correlated bandwidth anomalies not plausible

**Medium Hypothesis in Biological Perspective**:
- Places consciousness within biological perspective as a distinct, information-bearing medium
- Natural answer to "How does consciousness bear information?" is that it bears information as experience
- Distinguishes consciousness from other media by the fact of experience.

### 11 My Experience, Your Experience, and the World We Experience: Turning the Hard Problem Upside Down

**Roger N. Shepard and Piet Hut's Perspective on the Hard Problem of Consciousness**

**The Hard Problem**:
- The first-person problem of understanding how subjective quality arises from a physical system
- No advances in understanding physical processes have bridged the explanatory gap between physical description and subjective quality
- Consciousness doesn't seem to affect physical processes, yet we experience free will
- Physical processes are based on regularities and correlations in qualia, which are abstractions rather than directly experienced

**Turning the Hard Problem Upside Down**:
- The standard approach starts with a physical brain described by objective terms
- However, the independent existence of such a system is an inference from subjective experience
- Experiences, including dreams, challenge the notion of an objective "physical world"
- The problem of other minds is softened by starting with one's own subjective experience
- Inverting the approach requires viewing everything as part of our experience, not confined to the concrete senses
- Conscious experiences beyond one's own may indicate independent intelligences

**Conclusion**:
- Dreams and other subjective experiences suggest a dependence on something beyond the phenomena experienced
- The hard problem remains in distinguishing physical systems with vs. without conscious experiences

#### Consciousness and Neural Activity in Dreams: A Metadimension Perspective

**The Distinction Between Conscious and Unconscious Neural Activity**
- If a particular neurophysiological activity is necessary and sufficient for an experience, what distinguishes it from electrochemically identical activity that does not have an experiential accompaniment?
- Supposing every physical event has a corresponding conscious manifestation may be less arbitrary and more symmetrical.

**The Case of the Joke in a Dream**
- Belief that regularity/predictability is indicative of an independently existing physical world, while novel/surprising events suggest functioning mind
- Instances where dream leads to unexpected event or punchline, suggesting another consciousness at work within one's own brain
- Similarities between these examples and "split-brain" and "blindsight" phenomena
- Question: Why should we reject the idea of independent consciousness based on evidence from dreams?

**Another Dimension for Consciousness**
- Attempting to understand relation between subjective consciousness and brain organization structure
- Gap between understanding correlations between physical processes and conscious experiences
- Use of spatial metaphors in discussing this gap (e.g., "depth of meaning")
- Conjecture: Investigate reality by positing a "metadimension" for consciousness, similar to the role of time in motion
- Analogy: Space and Time are equiprimordial, not reducible to each other but transformable; same with existence and this metadimension.

### 12 The Boundary Problem for Phenomenal Individuals Gregg H. Rosenberg

**The Boundary Problem for Phenomenal Individuals**

**Phenomenal Individuals**:
- Consciousness has inherent boundaries
- Only some experiences are part of an individual's consciousness
- These boundaries individuate the phenomenal self in the world

**Boundary Problem**:
- Consciousness does not have inherent boundary makers at the midlevel where it exists
- Yet, consciousness has boundaries, which must be explained

**Characteristics of Phenomenal Individuals**:
- Human consciousness is a species of phenomenal individual
- Phenomenal individuals are manifolds of qualitative entities (e.g., feelings, sensations, appearances)
- Not every feeling, sensation, or appearance within the world occurs within an individual's phenomenal field
- Phenomenal individuals are associated with human bodies and their cognitive processing
- Individuation at midlevels of physical organization is fluid and conceptual

**Explaining Boundaries**:
- Midlevel patterns consist of other patterns of interaction and organization
- The boundaries of the phenomenal individual do not continue to overflow into these patterns
- The question is why certain patterns provide boundaries for phenomenal individuals, rather than others

**Thought Experiments**:
- Are subsystems of the brain (e.g., auditory information) associated with their own phenomenal individuals?
- Could there be simpler phenomenal individuals associated with subsets of cognitive activity?
- Is it possible that multiple levels of phenomenal individuals exist, analogous to Russian dolls within a larger one?

**Conclusion**:
- The physical image of the world as a multitude of interacting micro-physical entities suggests that other kinds of feeling subjects could exist.

#### Examining the Phenomenal Boundary Problem in Complex Systems and Organisms

**Boundary Problem for Phenomenal Individuals**

**Overview:**
- Discussion of a scenario where a robot fish's nervous system is functionally isomorphic to a real fish's brain
- Investigating the possibility of phenomenal individuals in simpler organisms
- Redirecting principles from human consciousness to boundary problem for phenomenal individuals

**Scenario: Robot Fish with Functionally Isomorphic Nervous System**
1. **Robot Fish**: Simulation of another, simpler kind of organism's brain - a fish (possibly a phenomenal individual)
2. **Design**: Remote processing and human relay system for inputs/outputs
3. **Functional Isomorphism**: Robot fish's nervous system is functionally similar to a real fish's brain
4. **Question:** Does this system support the existence of a phenomenal individual?
5. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - Each homunculus is a phenomenal individual but not the whole system (Edna and Esystem)
   - Each homunculus and whole system are phenomenal individuals
6. **Implications:**
   - Fish's cognitive system may contain phenomenal individuals
   - Boundaries of phenomenal individuals can be shifted
7. **Fish vs. E-system**
   - Ecosystem mapped to a functional part of the fish (Edna)
   - Coherence of a world where E-system is phenomenal individual but not the whole fish
8. **Third Possibility:**
   - Homunculi system is a phenomenal individual, but none of the homunculi are phenomenal individuals
9. **Explanation for Lack of Phenomenal Individuality in Fish:**
   - Intuitive understanding of phenomenal individuality leaves boundary conditions flexible
10. **Application to Actual Systems: Economies**
   - Economic system processes information and self-organizes, raising questions about group mind

#### Exploring Phenomenal Individuality and Boundary Problem in Physics

**Phenomenal Individuality and Boundary Problem**

**Thought Experiments**:
- Seeing the economy as a phenomenal individual leads to considering our bodies as part of a larger phenomenon
- Shifting boundaries of phenomenal individuality can be radical, but information about pattern/organization alone does not determine inherent individuality

**The Boundary Problem**:
- Traditional individuation via abstraction of significant patterns from microphysical interaction
- Coherently hypothesizing various boundary scenarios for phenomenal individuals
- Resulting scenarios are intuitively bizarre, but consistency is not an issue
- Need to understand inherent individuality in the natural world

**Potential Solutions**:
1. Fields of primitive particles/strings as candidates for phenomenal individuals
   * Threatens human consciousness if they're the only natural individuals
   * Universe would consist of feeling but no mechanism for higher-level consciousness
2. Following the flow of interaction to create a universal phenomenal individual
   * No room for mid-level boundaries necessary for human consciousness
3. Finding a principle that allows pushing boundaries outward, but not too far (boundary problem)

**Conclusion**:
- Navigating middle ground requires finding a natural criterion for individuation and understanding inherent individuality in the natural world.

### 13 Folk Psychology, Science, and the Criminal Law, David Hodgson

**Fundamental Question in Criminal Law: Free Will vs. Nature/Nurture**
- Discussion on the distinction between acts involving a guilty mind and those that do not
- Focus on common sense beliefs about free will and responsibility (folk psychology)

**The Principle of Mens Rea**
- Key principle in civilized criminal law: no conviction without proof of guilty act and guilty mind
- Conscious and voluntary actions
- Folk psychological concepts like belief, intention may be necessary for mens rea

**Example: Rape Case**
- Sexual intercourse without consent of woman
- Proof of absence of consent involves folk-psychological concepts (willingness, voluntariness)

**Deciding Criminal Responsibility**
- Courts decide without expert scientific or medical evidence
- No explicit conflict between common sense categories and scientific accounts of causation

**Defenses Involving Folk Psychology Concepts**
- Insanity, sane automatism
- Expert evidence from psychiatrists or psychologists may raise questions about folk psychology categories
- Conflict between folk psychology and scientific account of behavior

**Theoretical Problems of Folk Psychology**
- Prescientific, nonscientific language
- No scientific proof for consciousness or voluntary actions
- Unconscious motivation recognized since Freud's time
- Psychological experiments showing common sense view is often misconceived
- Recognition that common sense beliefs about free will and responsibility may be unintellectually respectable (three trends: recognition of unconscious motivation, fabrication and acceptance of plausible but untrue stories to explain experiences and actions)

#### Discussion on Free Will, Criminal Responsibility, and Human Rights in Relation to Neuroscience and Law

**The Relationship Between Unconscious Processes and Conscious Development**
- Unconscious processes contribute to actions, but there are other factors that determine how conscious processes develop
- Human beings are not just the product of nature and nurture (genes and environment)
- Early home environment can predispose individuals to criminal behavior
- Genetic and congenital factors may also influence criminal behavior, such as abnormal brain development and high testosterone levels

**The Scientific View vs. Common Sense**
- The scientific view assumes universality of causal laws, leaving no room for choice or intentional action
- Blakemore's perspective: All actions are products of the brain, distinguishing between conscious intention and reflexes is "scientific nonsense"
- However, common sense and principles of justice and human rights require a fundamental distinction between voluntary and non-voluntary acts

**The Human Rights Qualification to Coercion by the State**
- The system should only coerce people who have voluntarily breached a public law, with proportional punishment
- Utilitarian arguments for this qualification still presuppose the distinction between voluntary and non-voluntary actions
- Governments that do not recognize human rights qualifications assert that societal good overrides individual rights

#### The Philosophical Justification for Human Rights: A Defense Against Mechanistic Views of the Mind.

**Consensus on Human Rights Approach**
- Widely accepted that human rights approach is justified only in cases of real emergency, temporary measure until normality is established
- Proving consequences is impossible as no one can predict all outcomes or determine which totality is "better"
- Human rights have independent value and must be recognized; governments need to provide positive justification for denying them based on fairness considerations

**Importance of Distinguishing Guilty Minds**
- Discrimination between persons whose conduct makes freedom curtailment fair vs. unfair requires a voluntary breach of public law
- Rejecting the notion of a guilty mind could undermine human rights, as no rational basis for curtailing freedom of those who act illegally versus permissible restrictions on individuals not posing danger to society
- Frequently argued that folk-psychological categories are not intellectually respectable but they remain valid in questions of criminal responsibility until proven otherwise

**Approach to Understanding Human Rights and Consciousness**
- Scientists and philosophers should proceed assuming validity of folk psychology categories, especially in relation to criminal law
- Lack of workable system based on alternative hypothesis makes it necessary to continue assuming validity of central distinction between responsible actions and those not subject to responsibility
- Unfortunate trend among elite scientists, cognitive psychologists, and philosophers towards discrediting folk psychology without proposing viable alternatives or exploring them further.

**Proposed Framework for Understanding Human Brain-Mind Relationship in Criminal Responsibility**
1. The human brain-mind is a physical and mental whole, with both aspects necessary to understand development over time.
2. Physical aspect: Development occurs automatically according to universal laws of nature (with or without randomness).
3. Mental aspect: Some development involves actions by conscious subject through choices between open alternatives based on nonconclusive reasons.
4. Neither perspective provides a complete account of system development.

#### Philosophical Analysis of Free Will, Responsibility, and Criminal Justice

**Framework for Understanding Free Will and Responsibility**

**Advantages of this Framework**:
- Stresses that reasons are not like physical forces: Measurable, commensurable, and conclusive
- Reasons are immeasurable, incommensurable, and nonconclusive; they require a conscious subject to choose
- Allows for adjustment to increasing knowledge of the etiology of crime while maintaining responsibility and human rights
- Recognizes role of physiology in crime but does not entirely reject notions of free will and criminal responsibility

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Choice is a Free Choice**:
   - Alternatives are left open by physical aspect and universal laws
   - Reasons for and against choice are immeasurable, incommensurable, and nonconclusive
   - History limits but does not determine the selected alternative
2. **Character and Circumstances Determine Choices**:
   - Person's character and circumstances determine available alternatives
   - How alternatives appear and reasons for/against them are affected by character
   - Does not predetermine the choice
3. **Free Will and Responsibility are Qualified**:
   - Influenced by unconscious factors of motivation and brain physiology
   - Freedom and responsibility exist, but can be affected by external factors like abuse or low serotonin levels
4. **Character is a Result of Previous Choices**:
   - Character and circumstances predetermine alternatives but not the choice
   - Person has some responsibility for character if it's a result of past choices

**Usefulness of this Framework**:
- Closer to the truth than orthodox mechanistic hypothesis
- Provides a useful working model for criminal responsibility, social/educational areas, and psychiatry practice
- Helps people take charge of their lives by recognizing personal responsibility and ability to make better choices in the future.

#### Punishment and Responsibility: Mitigating Factors and Deterrence in Criminal Justice

**Addressing Inequalities in Law Enforcement:**
- Attack inequalities through social programs
- Make law fair and non-discriminatory towards disadvantaged minorities
- Ensure law enforcement agencies do not target specific groups
- Use discretion when recording convictions, particularly in trivial cases
- Find alternatives to jail for disadvantaged offenders, if possible

**Changes to Definitions of Insanity and Automatism:**
- Reevaluate the definition of insanity and automatism based on a person's capacity to make choices
- Authorities may have power to protect society by treatment or detention if condition causing prohibited act could lead to repetition

**Moral Responsibility and Punishment:**
- Lesser moral responsibility does not guarantee lesser punishment
- Considerations for punishment: objective criminality, deterrence, protection of society, mitigating circumstances, previous character and remorse, prospects for rehabilitation, effect on offender
- Impact of factors (a)-(e) on offenders B and A may result in different punishments despite similar acts.

### 14 Zombie Killer Nigel J. T. Thomas

**Zombie Killer Nigel J. T. Thomas**

**Philosophers' Zombies**:
- Hypothetical beings behaviorally and functionally equivalent to humans, but lack conscious mental states
- Have same information-processing capacities as humans, but do not experience sensations or qualia

**Significance of the Zombie Concept**:
- Inconsistent with functionalism, which assumes all mental states can be identified with computational states
- Also inconsistent with physicalism, which assumes the mind can be explained entirely within physical terms

**Strict Equivalence**:
- Functional equivalence between persons is unlikely due to differences in mental skills and propensities
- Distinction between program/data and mental content or neural embodiment of memories is not clear

**Zombiphile Argument**:
- Concentrates on functionally equivalent zombies (equivalent in causal structure)
- Physicalism would also be vindicated along with functionalism if the zombiphile argument fails

**Falsity of Zombie Claims**:
- Lying or speaking falsely presupposes an intention, which a zombie lacks
- Mistaken but sincere claims about consciousness would involve the same cognitive mechanisms as conscious claims

**Belief Formation and Consciousness**:
- Cannot infer consciousness from correlations with other phenomena in the zombie world
- Consciousness cannot be eliminated like phlogiston without eliminativist challenges

#### Zombie Consciousness and Language: Meaningfulness and Truth.

**Zombiphile Argument and Consciousness**

**Key Points:**
- Zombiphiles argue that functionalism may not fully explain us if consciousness does not exist or might be different from what we assume
- They rely on the direct knowledge of our own consciousness to make their claims
- The cognitive process leading a zombie to believe it is conscious is indiscernible from ours, raising questions about its validity
- Moody's suggestion that zombies use "consciousz" instead of "consciousness" may not provide a coherent interpretation or meaning
- Meaninglessness as an alternative explanation, but it conflicts with the social nature of language and meaningfulness.

**Functionalism vs Consciousness:**
- Zombiphiles argue that functionalism might not fully explain us if consciousness does not exist or is different from what we assume
- Functionalism focuses on information processing and behavior control, while consciousness involves subjective experience
- The difference between consciousness and consciousnessz can lead to incoherence since both concepts are expressed and understood by zombies

**Misleading Processes:**
- There might be a process leading the zombie from its nonconsciousness to the equivalent mistaken belief of being conscious
- Such a process could be like a malfunctioning fuel gauge, providing false information
- This raises concerns about our ability to trust that we are not zombies

**Meaning and Truth:**
- Zombie's claims may not have truth value or meaning due to the nonreferential nature of their words related to consciousness
- Mere nonreferring terms do not result in meaninglessness, but falsehoods can be identified
- The controversial nature of jabberwock example and connection principle are discussed as potential explanations for zombie claims

**Language and Meaningfulness:**
- Zombies exhibit meaningful behavior, responses, and utterances in social interactions with other zombies
- Epiphenomenalism about language has no appeal because language is a social matter that depends on both causes and effects of utterances.

#### Exploring Consciousness, Intentionality, and Linguistic Meaning in Zombie Scenarios

**Zombies and Language**
- Language serves the same social functions for zombies as it does in reality
- Zombies have truth values, similar to humans
- Zombie assertions are assumed to be accurate unless there is reason to suspect otherwise

**Consciousness and Intentionality**
- Consciousness and intentionality are interconnected
- Giving up zombies does not mean abandoning the connection between consciousness and intrinsic intentionality in language
- Qualitative consciousness and intentionality can be seen as different aspects of the same phenomenon

**Intentionality vs. Cognitive Scientists' Views**
- Zombiphile mysterianism holds that understanding intentionality is difficult, while cognitive scientists often dismiss it as a solvable problem or deny its existence
- The "hard problem" of intentionality is different from Chalmers's "hard problem" of qualia in the context of zombie philosophy
- A scientific understanding of consciousness may be more attainable through a serious engagement with intentionality than by focusing on raw feels.

## III DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES

**Chapter 3: Can a Machine Be Conscious? - Danny Hillis' Argument for Yes**
- **The Need to Feel Unique**: Humans have historically sought to differentiate themselves from the natural world, but theories challenging human superiority are threatening
- **Rationality as a Human Attribute**: Reason was once believed to be unique to humans, but it is now being challenged by intelligent machines
- **Consciousness as the New Superiority Theory**: If reason no longer sets humans apart, consciousness becomes the new way to distinguish ourselves from machines
- **Defining Consciousness and Machines**: The meaning of "conscious" and "machine" will depend on how they are defined; the author suspects that it would be difficult to construct a generally intelligent device that is not conscious
- **Gedanken Experiment: Replacing Biological Neurons with Artificial Ones**
  - Building a life-size neuron simulator using future technology
  - Such a neuron simulator could restore mobility and feeling through prosthesis or brain replacement, mimicking real neuron responses
  - The author believes that a person using such a prosthetic would perceive exactly the same sensations as anyone else

#### Examining the Possibility of Artificial Consciousness

**The Experiment and Skepticism About Machine Consciousness**

**Gedanken experiment**:
- Simulating neuron function one at a time
- Resulting machine would be conscious, feel like the original person

**Types of Skeptics:**
1. **Feel vs. Conscious**: Agree on feelings but disagree on consciousness
2. **Plausibility**: Believe machines can't feel; based on personal prejudices
3. **Functional Simulation**: Question ability to build human-imitated consciousness
4. **Experimentally Testable Theory**: Best skeptics, as they can be proven wrong by science

**Arguments Against Machine Consciousness:**
1. **Penrose's Objection**: Confuses two senses of "algorithm"
2. **Searle's Chinese Box Argument**: Assumes change in scale does not result in qualitative change
3. **Other Arguments**: Focus on moral rather than scientific question
4. **Progress and Moral Question**: Building smarter machines will lead to deeper understanding, ultimately addressing the ethical implications of machine consciousness.

**Conclusion:**
- No definitive answer on whether machines can be conscious
- Disagreement stems from philosophical arguments and personal biases
- Importance lies in the moral question: Should we treat them as fellow beings?

### 16 Mindless Thought Experiments: A Critique of Machine Intelligence Jaron Lanier

**Critique of Machine Intelligence (Mindless Thought Experiments)**

**Introduction:**
- Jaron Lanier's critique of machine consciousness based on thought experiments
- Replacing neurons with silicon chips or software in the brain
  - Brain functions remain the same during replacement
  - Consciousness stays intact despite neuron replacements
- Thought experiment extended to software and rainstorm simulation

**Software as a Medium for Consciousness:**
- Every thought experiment can be taken further
- Raindrop positions or motions used to implement brain computation
- Large physical systems, like asteroid swarms or hurricanes, capable of implementing consciousness

**Limitations and Objections:**
1. **Essence Argument**: Objecting that passive programs are not conscious; rainstorms don't influence each other like neurons do.
2. **Universality of Human Perspective**: Relying on human perspective to validate machine consciousness may limit understanding of other organisms' perspectives.
3. **Turing Test**: Moral question regarding equal rights for conscious machines introduced through the Turing Test.

**Conclusion:**
- Critique of machine intelligence and consciousness as interchangeable terms
- Awareness that we have a real problem with understanding consciousness.

#### AI: A Religious Approach Threatens Human Understanding and Responsibility

**Turing Test and Machine Intelligence**

**Proposed by Alan Turing:**
- Person and computer communicate in isolation booths
- Human subject determines which is human, which is machine
- If human cannot tell difference, machine considered "equal"

**Interpretation of Turing Test:**
1. Human being may become more computerlike
2. Importance of understanding context and perspective

**Pragmatic Opposition to Machine Intelligence:**
1. User belief in a system's intelligence can be misleading
2. Functional gain from "intelligent" programs is subjective
3. Suspension of disbelief depends on how much we understand a problem
4. Machines already influence our lives without being conscious
5. AI funding driven by military and strategic interests
6. Belief in machine consciousness may hinder progress
7. The idea of AI can be compared to a religion, creating false expectations
8. Critics argue against the potential for machines to replace or surpass humans
9. Fear that focusing on AI might distract from addressing real-world problems
10. Importance of taking responsibility and understanding limitations in technology development.

### 17 Structure and Function Giuseppe Vitiello

**Letter to Patricia Churchland on Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness Studies**

**Patricia's Doubts about QM in Consciousness Studies**:
- In her talk, she expressed doubts about using quantum mechanics (QM) in studying consciousness.
- She explained that there are real challenges in both hard and easy problems related to consciousness.
- She was unsure if QM could provide any useful insights into the mystery of consciousness.

**The Successes of Quantum Mechanics**:
- Physicists, chemists, engineers, and other scientists have successfully applied quantum mechanics to many practical applications in solid-state physics, electronics, chemistry, and more.
- Everyday life depends on these successful applications of quantum mechanics.
- Even the periodic table of elements is well understood through the lens of quantum mechanics.

**The Distinction between Structure and Function**:
- As physicists, they are interested in both structure (what things are made of) and function (how it all works).
- Listing components alone does not teach us much about the system being studied; dynamical knowledge is also crucial.
- Studying a phone book does not help us understand the city of Tucson as a whole.

**The Example of Crystals**:
- In crystals, atoms or molecules are arranged in specific lattice sites.
- When a crystal is broken (e.g., by melting), the constituent atoms no longer exist in the crystal phase.
- To reconstruct the crystal, one needs to supply ordering information that was lost when the crystal was destroyed.
- This ordering information is realized dynamically through phonons, which are the quanta of elastic waves propagating in the crystal.
- The function of being a crystal is identified with the particle structure, as the phonons exist only as long as the crystal does.

**The Connection Between Symmetry Breaking and Nambu-Goldstone Bosons**:
- When continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, a massless particle (the Nambu-Goldstone boson) is dynamically created to carry the ordering information.
- The presence of these bosons adds no energy to the state, ensuring that the ordered pattern is stable.

#### Quantum Dynamics of Living Matter and Consciousness

**Understanding Crystals and Living Matter through Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

**Crystals as Ordered Ground States**
- Crystalline structure has the same energy as unordered gaseous one (degenerate ground states)
- Classified by ordering degree or order parameter
- Phases of matter depend on condensate density
- Tuning condensate density allows for exploration of different phases

**Bridge Between Microscopic and Macroscopic Scales**
- Ground states provide a bridge between quantum scale and everyday life
- Real experiments confirm QFT as the only reliable quantum theory

**Challenges in Understanding Consciousness**
- Not just data or statistics, but dynamics are crucial
- Comparison to mechanical puppets: long-range correlations required for crystal formation

**Dynamical Background of Living Matter**
- Self-ordering, behavior far from equilibrium, nondissipative energy transfer, and other specialized units point to a unifying dynamical scheme
- Searching for a dynamical background to understand molecular biology

**Quantum Dynamics in Living Matter vs. Classical Limit**
- Atoms, molecules, and dynamically generated units follow quantum laws
- Planck constant has a well-defined value that never equals zero
- Classical behavior emerges from quantum features (e.g., crystal formation)

**Implications for Cancer Research**
- Hook strategy focuses on random kinematics without dynamics involved in tissue formation
- Applying QFT concepts like collective modes, spontaneous symmetry breakdown, and coherence to study normal state of cancer versus ordered state of tissue.

**Dissipative Characteristics of Living Matter and Consciousness**
- Information recording breaks time-reversal symmetry (introduces arrow of time)
- Brain dynamics are intrinsically irreversible, leading to potential consciousness mechanisms from mirror brain dynamics.

### 18 ""More Neural Than Thou"" Stuart R. Hameroff

**Neuralism vs. Non-Neural Approaches to Consciousness**

**Non-Neural Approaches**:
- Chalmers's fundamental information theory
- Searle's "intrinsic" property of brain
- Penrose-Hameroff quantum phenomena in microtubules

**Churchland's Neuralism**:
- Consciousness will be fully explained by neural dynamics at the level of neurons and neural networks
- Neuronal firing patterns triggered by synaptic chemical transmissions are fundamental correlates of consciousness
- Oversights in neuralism:
  - **Probabilistic neurotransmitter vesicle release**: Only about 15% of action potentials result in actual release
  - **Gap junctions**: May mediate coherent 40-Hz activity implicated in binding and "self"
  - **Dendritic processing**: Consciousness may occur primarily in dendritic-dendritic processing, with axonal firings supporting automatic activities
  - **Glial cells**: Ignored in neuralism
  - **Cytoskeleton**: Neuronal microtubules and other cytoskeletal structures are important for neuronal architecture, synapse regulation, neurotransmitter transport, and post-synaptic signaling

**Penrose's Platonic Universe**:
- Includes mathematical truths, laws, relationships, aesthetics, ethics, and experience as fundamental entities
- Reality at the Planck scale (10^-33 cm, 10^-43 sec) is not smooth; it "seethes with subtle activities"
- Quantum electrodynamics (QED) predicts that particles and waves ("virtual photons") continuously appear and disappear at the Planck scale
- Churning quantum fluctuations ("quantum foam") imparts dynamic structure and measurable energy ("zero-point fluctuations")
- Casimir force: Measured force between parallel surfaces separated by a tiny gap, caused by surplus virtual photons outside the gap region
- Hall's calculations of the Casimir force on microtubules predict significant pressure (0.5 to 20 atm) exerted by the quantum vacuum on microtubules of sufficient length

#### Quantum Spin Networks in Brain's Microtubules as Consciousness Mechanism

**Quantum Spin Networks and Objective Reduction (OR)**

**Penrose's Introduction of Quantum-Mechanical Geometry at Planck Scale:**
- Introduced "quantum-spin networks" to describe the geometry of space at the Planck scale (Rovelli and Smolin 1995a,b)
- Spectra of discrete Planck-scale volumes and configurations qualify as philosophical monads
- May encode protoconscious experience and Platonic values

**The Casimir Force:**
- Quantum vacuum zero-point fluctuation energy measured by placing two macroscopic surfaces with a small gap (Lamoreaux 1997)
- Net "quantum foam" exerts pressure, forcing surfaces together
- Hall calculated Casimir force on microtubules to be roughly 10^6 times greater than measured by Lamoreaux

**Penrose's Objective Reduction (OR):**
- Proposed quantum-gravity solution for wave-function collapse in quantum mechanics
- Superposition of mass and space-time causes underlying geometry to separate, leading to instability and reduction
- Critical degree of separation results in instantaneous self-collapse, choosing particular states noncomputably

**OR Model in Microtubules:**
- Penrose and Hameroff proposed a biological OR occurring in microtubules in the brain's neurons (Penrose and Hameroff 1995; Hameroff and Penrose 1996a,b)
- Quantum reductions in MTs are consistent with Whitehead's "occasions of experience" and coherent neural events
- Links Platonism, biology, and fundamental experience at the Planck scale

**Anesthesia and Consciousness:**
- Anesthetics inhibit consciousness but do not eliminate all brain activities (Franks and Lieb, Chapter 38, this volume)
- Evidence points to proteins in neuron membranes as anesthetic target sites
- Anesthetics act directly on specific proteins through weak van der Waals forces in hydrophobic regions
- Postsynaptic membrane proteins belonging to the acetylcholine receptor superfamily are potential targets.

#### Quantum Theory's Role in Anesthesia and Consciousness

**Anesthesia, Microtubules, and Hydrophobic Pockets**

**Microtubules and Anesthetics:**
- Discovered effect of anesthetics on microtubules in axoneme structure of a tiny urchin (Allison and Nunn, 1968; Allison et al., 1970)
- Axoneme disassembly at higher doses than clinical levels but shortening begins at twice the dose
- Halothane causes microtubules to reassemble into larger "macrotubules" (Hinkley and Samson, 1972; Hinkley, 1978)
- Decrease in microtubule numbers and density after exposure to halothane (Livingston and Vergara, 1979)
- Halothane binds to tubulin and disrupts actin gelation at very low concentrations (Uemura and Levin, 1992; Hinkley and Telser, 1974)

**Anesthetics, Proteins, and Consciousness:**
- Collective locus of anesthetic effect: array of discrete hydrophobic sites in various proteins throughout the brain (Franks and Lieb)
- Cutoff effect: anesthetic sites are smaller than a cubic nanometer
- Hydrophobic pockets utilize van der Waals interactions, electron quantum fluctuations, and delocalization (Fröhlich, 1968)
- Electron localizations in hydrophobic pockets cause specific protein conformations (Fröhlich, 1968)
- Quantum superposition possible in these pockets (Penrose-Hameroff model)
- Anesthetics prevent quantum coherence in hydrophobic pockets of membrane proteins, tubulins, or both.

**Comparison between Orch OR and Neuralism:**
Feature 1: Experience, Hard Problem
Orch OR: Ascribes experience as a fundamental property of the universe (Penrose's quantum-spin networks) vs. neuralism: Unspecified critical level of neuronal computational complexity.

#### Quantum Consciousness Theory: Microtubules and Space-Time

**Orch OR Features and Explanations:**

**Feature 1: Self-Organizing Process (Experience as Fundamental)**
- Orch OR: A self-organizing process selecting particular configurations of fundamental geometry
- Postulates experience as a "fundamental" feature of reality
- Mechanism for accessing and selecting experiences

**Feature 2: Coherent Neural Activity and Binding (Neuralism)**
- Coherent neural membrane activities bind in vision and "self" through temporal correlation
- Orch OR: Macroscopic quantum states are single entities, not just temporally correlated separate entities

**Feature 3: Free Will**
- Problem with understanding free will is that our actions seem neither deterministic nor random
- Penrose's objective reduction ("OR") proposed solution
- Quantum superposed systems evolve until energy-time product reaches a barrier, collapsing to definite states
- Collapse choices are not deterministic or probabilistic but reflect hidden quantum logic

**Feature 4: Noncomputability (Neuralism)**
- Argument from Gödel's theorem about human thought's noncomputability provoked criticism
- Penrose responded, addressing issues in The Emperor's New Mind and Shadows of the Mind
- Noncomputability evident in mathematical understanding, creativity, and evolutionary unpredictability
- Orch OR: Self-collapse of wave function's superposition is predicted to be noncomputable

**Feature 5: Transition from Preconscious Processes to Consciousness (Neuralism)**
- Conscious experience emerges at a critical threshold of neural activity
- Prereduction tubulin superposition phase equated with preconscious processes
- Quantum gravity threshold reached, causing objective reduction and selection of new fundamental experience geometry.

## IV NEURAL CORRELATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS

**Neural Correlates of Consciousness**

**Overview**:
- Neuroscience task is identifying neural systems associated with conscious experience (Neural Correlate of Consciousness, NCC)
- Challenges: consciousness cannot be directly observed, and no "consciousness meter" exists
- Research requires preexperimental assumptions to identify conscious processes

**NCC Models**:
- Many NCC models proposed, listed by Chalmers in Part IV (e.g., specialized brain region, brain connectivity)
- Degree of compatibility between models is significant

**Susan Greenfield's Proposal**:
- Consciousness correlates with brain connectivity as an emergent property of nonspecialized networks
- Consciousness degree depends on arousal, epicenter size, and associative neuronal connectivity
- Applies theory to EEG, dreams, and schizophrenia treatment data

**Bogen's Subjectivity Pump**:
- Intralaminar nuclei in thalamus are likely loci for subjectivity pump
- Characteristics: widespread access, coordination of attention and action, 40 Hz synchronization with cortex

**Emotional Awareness**:
- Lane et al. study levels of emotional awareness using PET to correlate with anterior cingulate cortex activity
- Find consistency with previous studies on perceptual stimuli recognition
- Speculate on role in emotional disregulation theory

**Consciousness Under Anesthesia**:
- Alkire et al. study metabolic activity changes under general anesthesia using PET
- Unconscious brain shows dramatically lower regional metabolic activity than awake brain
- Isoflurane and propofol studies suggest cortical depression more severe than subcortex
- Thalamus may play a critical role in subjective awareness by comparing present with past

**Integrative Theory**:
- Baars, Newman, and Taylor integrate neurobiological theories to propose a "relational global workspace" framework for consciousness
- Consciousness is an architectural aspect of brain organization, involving interaction between sensory input and memory
- Cortical foci provide consciousness content; brain stem-thalamocortical axis supports conscious state.

#### Neuropsychological Models of Consciousness: Comparator Theory and Synaesthesia

**Consciousness Models and Theories**
- **Several Models of Consciousness**:
  - Selective attention system: Nucleus reticularis in thalamus selects conscious contents (Hebb, 1974)
    * Includes posterior cortex for sensory conscious content
    * Anterior cortex involved in active control
  - Consciousness required for normal experience and volition
  - Stable contextual self-system with predictability in varied situations

- **Gray's Neuropsychological Hypothesis** (Chapter 25)
  * Current perceptual world compared to predicted state
  * Conscious content from comparator identified as subiculum of hippocampal complex within medial temporal lobe
  * Unable to explain why brain generates conscious experience ("hard problem")
- **Research Proposal: Brain Imaging Experiments**
  - Study word-color synaesthetes vs. control subjects
  - Determine if special experiences due to hard wiring or associative learning
  - Evidence of hard wiring implies specific conscious experiences depend on neuronal events

**Common Themes Among Models:**
- Anatomical regions in thalamus direct attention towards cortical epicenters
- Consciousness involves temporal feedback between present moment, immediate past, and predicted future.

### 19 On the Search for the Neural Correlate of Consciousness David J. Chalmers

**The Search for the Neural Correlate of Consciousness (NCC)**

**Introduction:**
- Recent neurobiological research on consciousness
- Progress in understanding foundational concepts
- Overview of various proposed NCCs
	+ 40-Hz oscillations in cerebral cortex (Crick & Koch)
	+ Intralaminar nucleus in thalamus (Bogen)
	+ Reentrant loops in thalamocortical systems (Edelman)
	+ 40-Hz rhythmic activity in thalamocortical systems (Llinas et al.)
	+ Nucleus reticularis (Taylor & Alavi)
	+ Extended reticular-thalamic activation system (Newman & Baars)
	+ Anterior cingulate system (Cotterill)
	+ Neural assemblies bound by NMDA (Flohr)
	+ Temporally extended neural activity (Libet)
	+ Back-projections to lower cortical areas (Cauller & Kulics)
	+ Visual processing within the ventral stream (Milner & Goodale)
	+ Neurons in visual cortex projecting to prefrontal areas (Crick & Koch)
	+ Neural activity in V5 (Tootell et al.)
	+ Certain neurons in superior temporal sulcus and inferior temporal cortex (Logothetis & Schall, Sheinberg & Logothetis)
	+ Neuronal gestalts in an epicenter (Greenfield)
	+ Outputs of a comparator system in the hippocampus (Gray)
	+ Quantum coherence in microtubules (Hameroff)
	+ Global workspace (Baars)
	+ High-quality representations (Farah)
	+ Selector inputs to action systems (Shallice)

**Challenges:**
- Consciousness cannot be measured directly
- Lack of a consciousness meter
- Need for preexperimental bridging principles

**Preexperimental Bridging Principles:**
1. **Verbal Report Principle**: When information is verbally reported, it can be inferred as conscious.
2. ... (to be continued)

#### Functional Criteria for Consciousness: Global Availability as a Neural Correlate

**Principles Relating to Consciousness and Verbal Report**

**Limitations of Principles Based on Verbal Report**:
- Belief that verbal report is not required for consciousness
- Expanded principle: When information is directly available for verbal report, it is conscious
- Experimental researchers use various methods beyond these principles

**Experiments on Consciousness in Language-Free Creatures**
- Work by Nikos Logothetis and colleagues using monkeys
- Rely on the monkey's bar pressing responses to infer conscious perception
- Principle: If information is available for response in many ways, it is conscious

**General Principle of Global Availability**:
- When information is directly available for global control, it is conscious
- Applicable when language is present or absent
- Fits first-person evidence from our own conscious experience

**Implications and Limitations of the Global Availability Principle**:
- Tricky cases like blindsight may require refinement of the criterion
- Consciousness can be present without voluntary control in some cases
- Further discussion of puzzle cases and their resolution elsewhere (Chalmers 1997)

**Rational Reconstruction of Searching for Neural Correlates of Consciousness**:
- Researchers implicitly embrace functional criteria like global availability
- Rational reconstruction: Consciousness -> Global Availability -> Consciousness (Global Availability) -> Neural Process N

**Consequences of the Rational Reconstruction**:
1. Characterization of Neural Correlates of Consciousness: If the NCC is arrived at through this methodology, it will be a mechanism for global availability.
2. The NCC is a symptom rather than a mechanism if dissociation studies and lesioning data suggest consciousness can occur without it.
3. Searching for the NCC requires preempirical principles that are refined as experimental research progresses.
4. Consciousness may be present even when specific neural processes are not, suggesting that the NCC is not a perfect correlate of consciousness.
5. Dissociation studies, lesioning, and other methods can help address uncertainties about the NCC's role in global availability.
6. The search for the NCC may require addressing challenges like measuring and controlling for confounding variables.

#### Neural Correlates of Consciousness: Global Availability and Modules

**Understanding Consciousness and Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)**

**Theories on Global Availability in Brain:**
- Indirect mechanisms dissociable from consciousness through direct availability stimulation
- Mechanisms proposed: 40-Hz oscillations, extended neural activity, global workspace

**Mechanistic Explanation for Consciousness:**
1. Explains global availability in the brain
2. Isolates processes underlying consciousness but does not explain why they give rise to it
3. Likely multiple neural correlates of consciousness due to various mechanisms of global availability
4. Possibility of a "consciousness module" as an integrated area responsible for all global availability, though empirically uncertain
5. Neural correlates may be found in extrastriate visual cortex if directly implicated in global availability (Crick & Koch's suggestion)

**Global Availability:**
- Functional property explaining how information becomes available for global control
- Mechanisms: multiple, various stages, different modalities
- Possibility of a consciousness module as an integrated area responsible for all global availability.

#### Neural Correlates of Consciousness: Limitations and Implications.

**Neural Correlates of Consciousness: Understanding Its Significance**

**Crick and Koch's Idea:**
- They suggest neural processes explaining access consciousness might be associated with phenomenal consciousness
- This idea relies on shaky bridging principles, but all work in this field must appeal to such principles

**Limitations of Neural Correlate as Holy Grail:**
- No definitive test for consciousness using the neural correlate alone
- Primary criterion remains functional property: global availability or verbal report
- NCC is significant only because it satisfies the functional criterion
- Once dissociated from functional property, limitations apply

**The Quest for Neural Correlates of Consciousness:**
- Enhances understanding of consciousness by bringing neuroscience and philosophy together
- Clarifies deep problems involved in studying consciousness.

### 20 A Rosetta Stone for Mind and Brain? Susan A. Greenfield

**Rosetta Stone for Mind and Brain: Understanding Consciousness**

**Background**
- Susan A. Greenfield's perspective on consciousness
- Inspired by Tony Bland's case and philosophical debates

**Approach to Understanding Consciousness**
1. Develop a theoretical Rosetta stone for subjective and physical phenomena of consciousness
2. Identify phenomenological features of consciousness
3. Unravel the mysteries of infant, animal, and neonatal consciousness
4. Reject fixed consciousness center idea
5. Consider consciousness as a continuum with varying degrees
6. Emphasize the role of brain connectivity in consciousness
7. Explore representational consciousness theory
8. Understand consciousness through individual experiences and associations
9. Neurons can be transiently recruited to create epicenters for conscious processes

**Infant, Animal, and Neonatal Consciousness**
- Plausible explanation: Consciousness present in the womb but not identical to adult human consciousness
- Fetus's brain has fewer connections than an adult's
- Connections grow in density during early life
- Debate about lower animals being conscious or not

**Philosophical Debates on Consciousness**
- Distinction between sensory experience and higher-order cognitive consciousness
- Michael Tye argues that all forms of consciousness are representational

**Characteristics of Consciousness**
1. Continuum: varies in degree
2. No fixed center: arises from a growing assembly of neurons
3. Representation or focus: entails some sort of epicenter or experience
4. Transient recruitment of neurons: creates individual associations and strengthens connections.

#### Consciousness: Emergence, Properties, and Variations

**Properties of Consciousness**

**Three Properties of Consciousness:**
- Spatially multiple yet effectively single at any one time
- An emergent property of nonspecialized and divergent groups of neurons that is continuously variable with respect to, and always entailing, a stimulus epicenter
- The size of the assembly, hence the degree of prevailing consciousness, is a product of the interaction between degree of arousal and recruiting power of the epicenter

**Factors Affecting Consciousness:**
- Neuronal connectivity: extent and strength
- Arousal levels: intensity and consistency
- Stimulus signal: strength and meaning to the individual

**Neural Assembly Sizes:**
- Small assemblies: fetal brain, dreaming consciousness, schizophrenia
- Large assemblies: adult human brain, daytime awareness

**Epicenter and Consciousness:**
- Epicenter: stimulus source that activates neuronal assemblies
- Recruiting power of the epicenter depends on strength of stimulus signal and extent of associative neuronal connectivity

**Modulation Chemicals:**
- Certain chemicals, released according to biorhythms and arousal levels, modulate ease of forming transient neuronal assemblies
- Selective targets for mood-modifying drugs such as Prozac or Ecstasy are chemical systems that affect the sizes of these assemblies.

#### Linking Dreaming, Schizophrenia, Childhood Consciousness through Neuronal Assembly Patterns

**Linking Conditions of Dreaming, Schizophrenia, and Childhood**
- Disconnected and highly labile consciousness linked to:
  - Dreaming
  - Schizophrenia
  - Childhood
- Characteristics of this consciousness:
  - Dissociative nature (flimsy neuronal assemblies)
  - Randomly forming and reforming
- Less extreme level application:
  - Constantly changing depths of consciousness throughout the day/night
- Raising or blunting consciousness
- Individual types described with increasing specificity

**Advancements in Brain Imaging**
- Noninvasive brain imaging advances in a few years
- Sensitive enough to monitor transient populations of neuronal assemblies

**Potential Outcomes and Limitations**
- Common forum for scientists and philosophers
- Descriptive framework at physiological and phenomenological levels
- Significant step forward, but not an explanation
- Private nature of consciousness remains inviolate from probings by scientists and philosophers alike.

### 21 Locating the Subjectivity Pump: The Thalamic Intralaminar Nuclei Joseph E. Bogen

**Subjectivity and Thalamic Intralaminar Nuclei (ILN)**
* Proposal: Subjectivity (C) is generated by neuronal activity in and around ILN of each thalamus (Bogen, 1993b).
* Falsification: Find someone with complete, bilateral destruction of ILN who remains conscious.
* Plausibility: Long-held belief, many informed persons believe it or something similar, physiological evidence presented by Llinas and colleagues.
* Distinction between C and Content of Consciousness:
  * Core of consciousness includes subjectivity, self or "me-ness" (e.g., "It hurts me," "I see red," "I feel thirsty").
  * C is a property of varying intensity, content is not our main focus here.
* Distinguishing C from Mechanism Producing It: Pointing to C may be like pointing to the wind; we can identify effects and causes but not directly observe C itself.
* Clues for Locating Mechanism: Small bithalamic lesions involving both ILN impair C, large bicortical lesions typically do not affect consciousness significantly.
* Localizing Mechanism: Aggregates of neurons form specialized circuits (e.g., rhythm generation, memory processing); ILN developmentally organize to produce C.
* Mechanism for C is Double: Intact cerebrum has two mechanisms, one suffices for C; structural duality handled by the brain is an important question but not the focus here.
* Mechanism for C is Thalamic: Emphasized by Penfield and Jasper (1954), C is not produced by cortex; some potential contents of consciousness are primitive and may predate the evolution of higher functions.

#### The Role of Intralaminar Nuclei in Consciousness and Attention

**Understanding Consciousness and the Intralaminar Nuclei (ILN)**

**Special Contents of Consciousness**:
- Mechanisms might endow with complex cortical activity, described as "representations of representations" or "higher-order thoughts"
- These special contents are not the crucial core of consciousness
- Such special contents may influence other cerebral functions without reaching awareness

**ILN's Role in Consciousness**:
- ILN plays a critical role in consciousness, as damage to ILN can cause immediate unresponsiveness
- Simultaneous bimedial thalamic infarction (occlusion of the arterial trunk supplying both thalami) can lead to sudden onset of coma
- Emergence from unresponsiveness after bithalamic lesions is commonly accompanied by mental impairments like confusion, dementia, amnesia or hypersomnia/both

**ILN Connections**:
- ILN receives ascending input from the brainstem reticular formation, spinothalamic system, cerebellum, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, and vestibular nuclei
- This suggests a monitoring of motor systems, as do the cortical projections to ILN from sensorimotor and premotor cortex
- ILN also has substantial projections to striatum, which may be involved in inhibiting (or releasing) developing motor plans
- Reticular nucleus (nRt) of thalamus provides a physiological basis for selective attention but fails to account for the subjectivity of primitive content

**"Appropriate Interaction" and Synchronization**:
- Crick and Koch suggested that the "appropriate interaction" between ILN and cortex involves synchronization of neuronal activity at 40 Hz
- For direction of motion awareness to occur, an "appropriate interaction" must take place between ILN and MT (or its targets)

**ILN's Role in Consciousness Debate**:
- Penfield and Jasper's "centrencephalon" concept was eclipsed due to:
  - Abandonment of the concept of centrencephalic seizures
  - Cerebral commissurotomy (split brain) reinforcing doubts about the existence of a centrencephalon

#### Exploring Intralaminar Nuclei's Role in Consciousness Mechanism

**The Problem of Localizing the Mechanism for Consciousness (C)**
- Can be approached as a single hemisphere issue, postponing integration of two mechanisms and "unity of consciousness"
- In the past, doubts were raised about the ILN projections to cortex due to unilateral decortication not causing rapid degeneration in ILN, like it did in most ipsilateral thalamus
- Another exception was the nRt, which does not project to cortex (Scheibel and Scheibel 1966; Jones 1985)
- However, more recent tracer techniques have shown that ILN do project to cortex, widely (Jones 1985)
- The "centrencephalon" concept held a germ of truth, which now needs to be nourished by considering ILN as a major constituent of the mechanisms providing consciousness in creatures like us

**Summary**
- **Understanding the neural mechanism for subjective experience (C)**
  - Requires identifying essential structures
- Role of ILN:
    - Awareness of primitive sensations: connected from ascending pathways
    - Awareness of cortical activity: widespread afference from cortex
    - Volition: heavy projection to striatum
      * Unlike striatum, ILN project widely to almost all neocortex, enabling an effect on ideation
      * Passage through nRt of ILN efferents could influence the attention-selective action of nRt
- Contrast with bilateral thalamic lesions involving ILN causing loss of consciousness compared to retention of C after large cortical ablations depriving consciousness of specific content
- Intensive study of ILN suggested as quickest route for better understanding consciousness

### 22 Anterior Cingulate Cortex Participates in the Conscious Experience of Emotion Richard D. Lane, Eric M. Reiman, Geoffrey L. Ahern, Gary E. Schwartz,

**Conscious Emotional Awareness**
- Conscious awareness of emotion can be a "double-edged sword" (Daftar 1996)
- Ability to experience pleasure stems from contrasting it with its opposite
- Excessive emotional experiences may require coping strategies and medical interventions
- Understanding neural substrate of emotional experience is relevant for mental health and disorders

**Levels of Emotional Awareness (LEAS)**
- Developed by Lane and Schwartz (1987) to measure individual's ability to recognize and describe emotion in self and others
- Based on Piaget's cognitive development model with five levels: physical sensations, action tendencies, single emotions, blends of emotions, and blends of blends
- Levels reflect degree of differentiation and integration of cognitive schemata used to process emotional information
- Development influenced by words used to describe emotion (representational redescription)

**Measuring Emotional Awareness with LEAS**
- Subjects presented with verbal descriptions of emotion-evoking situations, asked to write how self and other would feel
- Scoring based on degree of differentiation in use of emotion words and differentiation of self from other
- Desirable psychometric properties: high inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, correlations with other cognitive measures, right hemispheric dominance, ability to recognize emotional stimuli

**Emotional Awareness and Blood Flow in Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**
- Biological basis of conscious emotional awareness unknown
- PET study by Lane et al. (1996a, 1997a) identified BF changes in ACC associated with conscious emotional experience
- Correlations between LEAS and BF change attributable to emotion significant in ACC for both film-elicited and recall-elicited conditions
- No significant correlations between LEAS and specific components of this difference (emotions vs neutrals) in ACC for either condition
- Suggests the LEAS correlates with activity in the ACC specifically during emotion.

**Role of Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Conscious Emotional Awareness**
- ACC important in attention to or conscious awareness of perceptual stimuli (Corbetta et al. 1990, 1991, Pardo et al. 1990, Bench et al. 1993, Petersen et al. 1988, Frith et al. 1991, Paus et al. 1993)
- ACC activity increases with number of targets to be selected and decreases as task performance becomes automatic (Posner 1994)
- ACC may have a broader role in mediating consciousness (Cotterill 1995)
- Hypothesized role for ACC in emotional experience is well accepted in current neurosurgical practice.

#### Linking ACC and Emotional Consciousness in Health Outcomes

**Patients Reported Findings after Cingulotomy Procedure:**
- Patients still feel pain but don't care as much
- Relief possibly related to removal of emotional component
- Approximately 50% of patients have blunted affect postoperatively (Devinsky et al., 1995)
- Surgical lesions in ACC are quite large, precise locus of effects on emotional experience not known

**Theory about Levels of Emotional Awareness:**
- Higher LEAS scores reflect greater conscious attention to emotional experience and capacity for complex emotion perception during arousal
- Conscious emotional experience may be function of degree ACC participates with neural structures in emotion network
- Language contributes to concept formation, affects attentional resources, and discriminative performance
- BF increase in BA9 during emotion indicates possible role in regulating conscious experience or emotion decision making/inhibition (Kihlstrom, 1987; Damasio, 1994; Morgan et al., 1993)

**Implications for Health:**
- Deficits in capacity to experience and express emotion linked to poorer health outcomes
- Alexithymia: lack of words for emotions, impoverished cognitive schemata (Taylor et al., 1997)
- LEAS findings suggest alexithymia may stem from deficit in conscious awareness due to failure to attend to emotional experience
- Two aspects of conscious experience: automatic influences of emotion and attention vs. voluntary regulation through language and cognitive schemata

**Neurological Model of Alexithymia:**
- Functional commissurotomy model (Hoppe & Bogen, 1977) based on assumption emotional information in right hemisphere not transferred to verbal left hemisphere in alexithymic individuals but doesn't explain physiological basis of disease pathophysiology

**Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC):**
- Orchestrates motor, neuroendocrine, and autonomic responses to emotional stimuli
- Direct monosynaptic connections between ACC and vagal nuclei in brain stem
- Possible feedback loop for sympathetic arousal modulation through transmission of interoceptive emotion information to the ACC
- Failure of such transmission may lead to exaggerated and persistent sympathetic discharge. This alternative model provides physiological basis for disregulation theory (Schwartz, 1983). Conscious awareness promotes both psychological optimal adaptation and physiological health.

### 23 Toward the Neurobiology of Consciousness: Using Brain Imaging and Anesthesia to Investigate the Anatomy of Consciousness Michael T. Alkire, Richard

**The Neurobiology of Consciousness: Investigating the Anatomy of Consciousness**

**Background:**
- Crick's "Astonishing Hypothesis" proposes that consciousness is a property of biological neuronal systems in the human mind (1994)
- Limited investigation to human brain for scientific understanding of consciousness
- Question: Where does consciousness reside? Is it within individual sensory systems or requires global integration of brain functioning?
- Novel approach: experimentally manipulating consciousness using anesthetic agents and functional brain imaging

**Functional Brain Imaging:**
- Distinction between structural and functional brain imaging techniques (CT, MRI vs. PET, SPECT, fMRI)
- Reveals brain activity associated with specific functions or changes in regional blood flow
- Useful for studying complex cognitive processes related to consciousness such as learning, memory, attention, reasoning
- Few studies on altered levels of consciousness like sleep or coma; none on manipulating consciousness as a variable

**Study:**
- Researchers investigated functional brain anatomy during different types and depths of anesthesia in human volunteers
- Assessed auditory verbal memory during normal waking consciousness and unconsciousness using propofol general anesthetic agent
- Correlated subjects' performance on tests of auditory verbal memory with functional brain activity (PET) when exposed to memory stimulus in both conscious and unconscious states
- Used positron-labeled deoxyglucose tracer (FDG) to study human regional utilization of cerebral glucose in active brain neurons.

#### Propofol Anesthesia Decreases Global Brain Metabolism, Linked to Unconsciousness

**FDG Technique and Brain Metabolism**

**FDG technique**:
- Uses a radioactive tracer (18fluorodeoxyglucose) to measure brain glucose metabolism
- Tracer is phosphorylated by hexokinase, becoming 18fluorodeoxyglucose-6-phosphate, which cannot be further metabolized
- This trapped label within the brain provides a measure of regional metabolic activity

**FDG vs. Blood Flow Techniques**:
- FDG technique may more accurately assess regional metabolism than blood flow-based techniques in presence of anesthetics
- Anesthetics affect both regional cerebral blood flow and regional cerebral metabolism coupling relationship

**Study on Propofol Anesthesia**:
- First study to investigate brain metabolic changes during propofol anesthesia
- Participants studied while fully awake and unconscious
- Representative PET images show a significant reduction in regional brain glucose metabolism during anesthesia
- Whole-brain glucose metabolism reduction was 55 ± 13% on average
- Regional effects: Cerebral cortex was more affected than subcortical gray matter
- Further study with intermediate doses of propofol showed a dose-response relationship, suggesting loss of consciousness occurs when global neuronal functioning falls below a critical threshold

**Implications and Limitations**:
- Finding may not be specific to propofol anesthesia alone
- Suggests that consciousness is a distributed phenomenon in the human brain, but further considerations are needed.

#### PET Scan Shows Similar Brain Changes During Unconsciousness from Different Anesthetics

**Propofol Study Findings:**
- Similar pattern in regional metabolism during sedation and anesthesia with propofol
- Primary difference is a global, uniform reduction in brain metabolism from sedated to anesthetized condition
- Two classes of anesthetic agents produce unconsciousness by reducing global brain functioning below specific levels
- Consciousness may be a phenomenon widely distributed in the human brain

**Isoflurane Study:**
- Similar pattern in regional metabolism during isoflurane anesthesia and consciousness state
- Global uniform reduction in brain functioning, suggesting isoflurane's effects on consciousness circuitry
- Uniformity in metabolic reduction during propofol and isoflurane anesthesia

**Conscious vs. Unconscious Verbal Memory:**
- Subjects with no recall of information presented under general anesthesia
- Better performance on forced-choice recognition test than expected by chance
- Significant correlations in brain regions involved with auditory verbal memory for both conscious and unconscious conditions
- Conscious and unconscious correlations showed more regional anatomic overlap than differences
- Negative correlations between visual association cortices, white matter deep to areas 39/40, right caudate for unconscious condition only.
- Most revealing difference: high correlations of memory performance scores with mediodorsal thalamic nucleus region in the conscious state.

#### Thalamus' Role in Conscious Memory Processing and Gatekeeping Function Hypothesis

**Thalamus' Role in Memory: Human vs. Animal Studies**

**Correlation between Unconscious and Conscious States:**
- In unconscious condition, memory performance scores were uncorrelated with thalamic activity (r = +0.01)
- Significant difference in correlated thalamic activity between conditions (p < 0.01)

**Influence of Thalamus in Human Memory:**
- Damage to thalamus or diencephalon leads to global anterograde amnesia, affecting conscious explicit memory but not unconscious implicit memory (Cole et al., 1992; Winocur, 1985, Markowitsch et al., 1985; Mishkin, 1982; Graff-Radford et al., 1990; Aggelton and Mishkin, 1983; McKee and Squire, 1992; Vogel et al., 1987; Malamut et al., 1992)
- Conscious memory requires thalamic activity, while unconscious memory does not (Animal literature)

**Human PET Data:**
- Subjects with better explicit recall had more metabolic activity within the thalamus at encoding time
- Thalamic activity during encoding predicts subsequent ability in long-term free recall of verbal information
- Similar relationship found for emotional memory and amygdala activity (Cahill et al., 1996)

**Roles of Thalamic Conscious Activity:**
- May affect memory processing by regulating or controlling attention (LaBerge and Buchsbaum, 1990; Posner, 1994)
- Required for proper memory encoding (Graff-Radford et al., 1990; Squire, 1981; Huppert and Piercy, 1979)
- Encoding hypothesis consistent with finding that level of relative metabolic activity at encoding determines recall ability
- Thalamus may influence both encoding and retrieval processes with different types of activity required for each process (Fletcher et al., 1995)

**Gatekeeper Function:**
- Thalamus, especially the MD nucleus, might serve as a gatekeeper in partially regulating information that gains access to conscious mind.

**Consciousness and Global Whole-Brain Metabolic Reduction:**
- Unconscious state associated with whole-brain metabolic reduction (two types of anesthetic agents)
- Consciousness may only be evident when critical threshold amount of global neuronal activity is present

**Thalamus in Neurobiology of Consciousness:**
- Many current theories involve the thalamus or cortical-thalamic interactions (Crick, 1994; Baars, 1988; Llinas and Ribary, 1993)
- Conscious and unconscious verbal memory processing share much anatomic overlap but do not show functional overlap within the thalamus.

### 24 Neuronal Mechanisms of Consciousness: A Relational Global-Workspace Framework Bernard J. Baars, James Newman, and John G. Taylor

**Neuronal Mechanisms of Consciousness: A Relational Global-Workspace Framework**

**Background:**
- Baars, Newman, and Taylor explore convergence of ideas and evidence in consciousness research
- Consensus building among contemporary approaches by Weiskrantz, Gray, Crick et al.
- Cognitive neuroscience moving toward a shared understanding of consciousness in the brain

**1. Consciousness as an Architectural Aspect:**
1.1 Active Bright Spot: Working memory and sensory consciousness
   - Associated with sensory projection areas
   - Supported by subcortical systems (thalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, brain stem)
   - Attentional system selects conscious inputs
2. **Contextual Systems**: Unconscious but shape conscious content
   - Dorsal visual pathway, including right parietal cortex
   - Frontal cortex, memory-related systems (hippocampus), automatic routines (basal ganglia)
3. **Global Broadcasting:** Distribution of conscious information
   - Massive fiber tracts between cortical areas and thalamus
   - Extended reticular thalamic activating system (ERTAS) proposed as a neural substrate
4. **Conscious Experience**: Ceaseless interaction between input and memory
5.1 Relational feature: Past memories intermingle with present input
6. **Intermodal Inhibition:** Role of nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt) in global competition
   - Supports complex form of spatial competition beyond winner-take-all model
7. **Comparator System**: Hippocampus and basal ganglia play a role in generating conscious contents
8. **Alternative Hypothesis:** Feedback to ERTAS from cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia.

#### Neural Architecture for Conscious Processing and Attention

**Gray's Extension to His Original Model (1995)**

**Comparator System Output**:
- Connected to reticulo-thalamic core, believed to generate consciousness-as-such
- Fornix also projects to basal ganglia areas and nRt, which may be involved in selective attention and conscious processing

**Cortical Foci of Activity**:
- Provide content of consciousness
- Crucial aspect for consciousness is creation of "bubbles" of activity in cortex by local recurrence
- Single out regions with highest density of cells in layers 2 and 3, identical to sites with highest coding

**Competition and Cooperation Among Inputs**:
- Multiple sensory inputs, including "inner" inputs like visual imagery and inner speech, compete for access to consciousness
- Top-down influences include goal systems and emotional/motivational systems in frontal cortex
- Basal ganglia contribute to competition by supporting comparison and buffering needed for sequence learning and rule formation

**Brainstem-Thalamocortical Axis**:
- Supports state of consciousness, not detailed content produced by cortex
- Described as a "neural global workspace" extending from midbrain reticular formation to prefrontal cortex
- Integrates a "global attentional matrix" centered on nRt for gating information flow and regulating oscillatory patterns in cortex

**Selective Attention System**:
- Selects among multiple possible conscious contents
- Operates through the nRt, influenced by brain stem to prefrontal centers
- Controls sensory thalamic nuclei and allows continuous looping between thalamus and cortex under nRt control

**Posterior vs. Anterior Cortex**:
- Posterior cortex provides sensory conscious content
- Anterior cortex involved in active, voluntary control, part of the "thinking and planning" component of consciousness (Ca)

**Interaction Between Self-Structures and Consciousness**:
- Newman's analysis suggests immediate perception is supported by posterior cortical modules, allowing them to be interpreted as a passive part of conscious experience
- Interaction between self-structures and consciousness is mediated through this posterior corticothalamic system.

#### Theory of Global-Workspace Consciousness: A Theater Metaphor for Information Processing in Brain

**Baars' Proposed Framework for Consciousness:**
- One condition for consciousness: providing information to a self-system, ensuring predictability in varied situations
- Self-systems: left-hemisphere "narrative interpreter," self-structure of consciousness (Cs), emotional part (Ce)
  - Narrative interpreter located in meso-orbital frontal region
  - Emotional part diffusely distributed from limbic systems, especially dopaminergic and related aminergic neurotransmitter systems

**Blindsight and Visual Consciousness:**
- Blindsight patients: unconscious (implicit) visual knowledge but no conscious experience in damaged areas of the visual field
- V1 necessary for conscious vision, but not for unconscious visual knowledge
- Paradox of area V1: doesn't explicitly represent color or form, yet their absence abolishes all visual conscious features
- Higher visual areas have top-down feedback and bottom-up flow, enhancing active layers and decreasing nonconsistent ones (rich-get-richer principle)

**Relationship Between Sensory Consciousness:**
- Evidence for blindsight analogues in auditory and somatosensory cortex
- Early sensory-projection areas like a series of theater stages, with only one spotlight on at any moment
- Most active, coherent sensory cortex becomes conscious and is broadcast widely to suppress other cortices
- Conscious information from the most amplified area may be sent via thalamus, corpus callosum, or massive corticocortical connections within each hemisphere for rapid switching between different sensory cortices.

### 25 Creeping up on the Hard Question of Consciousness Jeffrey A. Gray

**The "Hard Problem" of Consciousness**

**Background**:
- Debate about the existence and solvability of the "hard question" of consciousness has been ongoing for many years
- Attention to the problem is now wider, with more scientists addressing it in their research
- The author's 1971 paper on the topic received no comments at the time, but the issue has become a central topic in the field

**The Hard Problem**:
- Conscious experience is not understood as well as other aspects of brain processing and behavior
- **Distinction between "easy" and "hard" problems**:
  - Easy problems: understanding information processing, linking input to behavior
  - Hard problem: explaining how brain activity gives rise to conscious experience
- The hard problem covers sensory perception, bodily sensations, emotions, etc.

**Criteria for a Successful Theory of Consciousness**:
1. **Evolutionary questions**:
   - How did conscious experiences evolve?
   - How do they confer survival value on organisms?
2. **Mechanistic questions**:
   - How do conscious experiences arise from brain events?
   - How do these experiences alter behavior?
3. **Linking consciousness to Darwinian selection**:
   - Consciousness must provide benefits beyond basic brain processes for it to have evolved by natural selection
4. **Challenges in addressing the hard problem**:
   - Experimental evidence contradicts everyday experience, making the issue more difficult to grasp

#### Comparator Hypothesis: Consciousness is related to brain's prediction-comparison mechanism.

**Consciousness and Brain**

**Background:**
- Consciousness related to brain function
- Brain can be viewed as a system that processes information to display behavior in an environment, composed of physical matter or biological tissue (cells, neurons)

**Possible Answers for the Distinguishing Features of Conscious Processes:**
1. Only biological nervous systems can produce consciousness.
2. Conditions 1-4 are essential: robot interaction with right environment and behavior would result in conscious experiences.
3. Nature of information processing system matters: passing Turing Test implies conscious experiences occur in computer.
4. Conscious experience a property of biological cells, especially nerve cells.
5. Only condition 5 matters: small quantum of consciousness might reside in single cell or neuron.
6. Other possibilities exist and are widely proposed without solid grounds for ruling out any answer.

**The Comparator Hypothesis:**
- Extends previous work on emotion anxiety modeling (Gray 1982) and acute schizophrenia conscious experience aberrations (Gray et al. 1991).
- Key feature: comparator system predicts next perceived state, compares it to actual state, determining if matched or not (Figure 25.2).
- Contents of consciousness consist of subicular comparator activity and feedback from comparator to perceptual systems that provided input for comparison.

#### Synesthesia: A Study of Cross-Modal Sensory Experiences

**Comparator Hypothesis and Consciousness**

**Table 25.1: Features of the contents of consciousness for which comparator hypothesis offers an account**
- **Conscious experience is closely linked to current action plans**
- **One is conscious of the outputs of motor programs, not the program itself**
- **Consciousness occurs too late to affect outcomes of processes it's linked to**
- **Conscious events occur on a time scale about two orders of magnitude slower than neural events**
- **Conscious experience has a spatiotemporal unity unlike neuronal events**
- **Conscious experience consists of constructions based on a model of the world, not direct reflections**
- **Consciousness is highly selective**
- **Neuronal events operate in parallel; consciousness operates serially**
- **Conscious experience is closely linked to memory**

**Problems with Comparator Hypothesis**
- Unable to answer hard questions about consciousness (e.g., changes in neural circuitry or information processing)
- Assumptions regarding consciousness tied to neural function, information processing, or both lack empirical justification

**Synesthesia: A Case Study for Studying Consciousness**
- Condition where sensations in one modality trigger automatic responses in another
- Consistent since early childhood and present throughout life
- Common combinations include seeing colors when hearing sounds (colored hearing)
- Previous scientific interest waned due to unreliable self-report data and lack of objective validation methods
- Recent research aimed at overcoming these issues by studying consistency in synesthetes' responses
- Findings: Synesthetes showed greater consistency than controls in associating colors with words, suggesting a genuine phenomenon.

**Improvements for Better Understanding Consciousness**
- Further research needed to validate synesthesia as real phenomenon
- Gathering relevant experimental evidence through studying brain function in synesthetes may help answer questions about consciousness.

#### Neuroimaging Studies Support a Biological Basis for Synesthesia

**Establishing Synesthesia's Genuineness and Neural Basis:**
- Consistency in individual as a way to test its genuineness
- Functional neuroimaging studies provide evidence:
  - PET study by Paulesu et al. (1995): abnormal visual cortex activation in synesthetes compared to controls during word processing
  - fMRI pilot study on one synesthete showed clear visual cortex activation while listening to words unlike a normal control
- Neural basis suggested: possible abnormal neuronal connectivity between auditory and visual cortices
- Genetic link: predominance of females, potential sex-linked for genetic reasons, family studies show female relatives affected

**Relevance of Synesthesia to the Study of Consciousness:**
1. Fodor's view on modularity: studying synesthesia may illuminate the organization of the normal brain and that of the synesthetic brain
2. Neural development mechanisms: studying synesthesia could help elucidate mechanisms of neural development by investigating persistent neuronal connections in infancy
3. Two hypotheses on how synesthesia occurs in the brain: permanent neural connections between modalities or learned associations, relevant to choosing between neuronal events and information processing as critical levels for conscious experience.
4. Current study using fMRI to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in various conditions to differentiate between hard-wiring hypothesis and associative learning hypothesis. Potential implications for understanding the nature of conscious experience and its relationship with neuronal events and information processing.

## V VISION AND CONSCIOUSNESS Overview Petra Stoerig

**Consciousness and Vision**

**Overview:**
- Two meanings of consciousness: being conscious (state) vs. representing information consciously
- Focus on visual system as best-studied sensory system
- Unconscious vision: neuroendocrine reactions, reflexes, blindsight
- Conscious vision: phenomenal vision, object vision, recognition

**Unconscious Vision:**
- Distinct neuronal pathways from conscious processing
- Neuropsychological evidence: Stoerig and Cowey (1997)
- Blindsight: Weiskrantz's modes, fMRI results, Iwasaki & Klein
- Logothetis and Leopold: unstable perceptual phenomena, recording monkeys' perception-related responses in visual cortical areas.

**Conscious Vision:**
- Two types: phenomenal representation (p) and conscious access (a)
- Block: independent from each other, different neural correlates
- Primary visual cortex involved in phenomenal representation
- Psychophysics used to explore properties of conscious perception
  - Temporal constraints on conscious vision: Iwasaki's digit identification under backward masking conditions
  - Signal detection methodology and double-judgment psychophysics, disentangling visual performance from conscious representation.

**Candidates for Conscious Vision:**
- Frontal cortex: Crick & Koch hypothesis denied by Weiskrantz et al. (1995) and Ishai & Sagi
- Visual cortex suggested by all authors addressing the question, including striate and extrastriate areas, frontal cortex, and thalamic nuclei.

### 26 Varieties of Vision: From Blind Responses to Conscious Recognition Petra Stoerig

**Varieties of Vision: From Blind Responses to Conscious Recognition**

**Consciously Represented Neuronal Processes**:
- Differ from non-consciously represented processes in measurable ways
- Visual system is the focus of empirical approaches to discover organizational principles

**Unconscious Vision vs. Absolute Blindness**:
- Legal blindness: Incapacitating reduction in visual acuity (1/25-1/50 of normal)
- Absolute blindness: Total absence of visual information processing
- Absence of reflexive responses and conscious vision

**Implicit Processing of Visual Stimuli**:
- Affects response to a second stimulus in the normal field
- Examples: Effect on reaction time, color perception

**Forced-Choice Responses in the Blind Field**:
- Patients can respond correctly up to 100% of the time with loss of sensitivity ranging from 0.4 to 1.5 log units
- Includes localizing stimuli, detecting brief stimuli, discriminating velocity and orientation

**Blind Responses: Four Levels**:
- Neuroendocrine responses (e.g., suppression of melatonin)
- Reflexes (pupil light reflex, photic blink reflex, optokinetic nystagmus)
- Effects on conscious visual responses
- Informed Glossary Kinds of blindness

**Kinds of Conscious Vision**:
- **Phenomenal vision**: Provides an image with qualia (lowest level)
- **Object vision**: Ability to see shape, segment image, bind qualia into objects
- **Object recognition**: Classifying visual object and registering its individuality and meaning

#### Understanding Vision: Levels of Conscious Perception and Blindsight Phenomena

**Levels of Blind Vision:**
- **Damage Pathways spared**: Remaining response function
  - Retino-hypothalamic pathway: Endocrine sleep-wake cycle (Pre-)geniculate
  - Extra-geniculo-striate pathways: Reflexive pupil, post-geniculate
  - Implicit pathways: Reaction to seen stimulus, post-geniculate forced-choice guessing
- **Patient Examples**:
  - Greenberg's patient: Normal visual acuity but unable to differentiate simple forms or group objects
  - Object vision disturbed without sensory deficits
  - Patients with more severe sensory deficits may not present with difficulties in object vision
- **Object Vision Process:**
  1. Phenomenal vision: Perceived as phenomenal but ungrouped for as long as the viewer has not achieved segmentation into visual objects
  2. Object grouping: Once objects are defined, seen quickly upon consecutive presentations
  3. Conscious recognition: Extent and content depend on individual's background knowledge
- **Functions of Vision:**
  - Neuroendocrine response of melatonin suppression sets circadian clock
  - Visual reflexes protect the organism from harm
  - Blindsight shapes visually guided behavior, even in patients with partial field defects
  - Bilateral absolute cortical blindness necessary to establish extent of blindsight-guided behavior
- **Phenomenal Vision vs Object Recognition:**
  - Phenomenal vision represents the prerequisite for object vision and recognition
  - Reverse disorder (intact conscious vision-based recognition in absence of phenomenal vision) has not been reported.

#### Neuronal Bases of Conscious Vision and Blindsight: Dissociations and Correlates

**Cortical Blindness and Phenomenal Vision:**
* Lack of form discrimination in blindsight not independent of cues from orientation and length of contour (Weiskrantz, 1987)
* Some information about objects available to cortically blind monkeys for avoiding obstacles, grasping raisins, catching cockroaches (Humphrey, 1974)
* Motor system may access this information, allowing accurate object grasping in apperceptive agnosic patient (Goodale et al., 1994)
* Color constancy impaired in patients with incomplete achromatopsia due to dependence on qualia for color recognition (Kennard et al., 1995)
* Conscious recognition requires qualia, though implicit recognition is possible (Bruyer et al., 1983)
* Cortically blind monkeys cannot visually recognize complex objects (Humphrey, 1974), resulting in "psychic blindness" or agnosia
* Dependence of color constancy on qualia demonstrated by impaired color identification in cortical blindness patients
* Phenomenal vision required for functions acting on a representation of physical stimulus properties rather than the property itself, such as color constancy and visual-based behaviors (James, 1890)
* Highly specific deficits like color anomia and optic aphasia demonstrate intricate connectivity between vision and behavior.

**Neuronal Correlates of Vision:**
* Lesions disrupt different neuronal circuits and mechanisms underlying distinct processing stages (Moore et al., 1995; Hoffman, 1989; Stoerig & Cowey, 1996)
* Subsets of retinal ganglion cells provide information for circadian clock, visual reflexes, and extrageniculate nuclei (Moore et al., 1995; Hoffman, 1989; Stoerig & Cowey, 1996)
* Primary visual cortex involvement in phenomenal vision: unclear function and role (Grusser & Landis, 1991; Kölmel, 1985; Weiskrantz et al., 1995; Sugita, 1996)
* Topographically imprecise projections to and from residual striate cortex may result in faint conscious experiences or perceptual completion of afterimages (Bender & Kahn, 1946; Farah et al., 1992)
* Occipital lobe destruction can be followed by visual hallucinations that disappear within weeks (Grusser & Landis, 1991; Kolmel, 1985)
* Unsuspected plasticity in primary visual cortex response to adaptive challenge may play a role (Sugita, 1996).

### 27 Single-Neuron Activity and Visual Perception Nikos K. Logothetis and David A. Leopold

**Single-Neuron Activity and Visual Perception**

**Sensation vs. Perception**:
- Part of what we perceive comes from external "things" around us
- The other part is derived from our own mind, likely the largest part

**Perceptual Changes in Ambiguous Figures**:
- Lines and patterns can be perceived differently
- Examples: Washerwoman with bucket, faces in panel B, figure-ground reversal
- Perceptual changes occur even when stimuli are stabilized in the retina

**Brain's Role in Deriving Object Descriptions**:
- Visual cortex has machinery to form neural descriptions of objects
- Neurons have topographic organization, selectivity for distinct stimulus attributes, and complex receptive fields
- Processing increases from primary visual cortex to higher areas in parietal and temporal lobes

**Challenges in Understanding Visual Perception**:
- How neural responses contribute to unified percepts and semantic knowledge about objects
- Difficulty understanding how "face-selective" neurons acquire their configurational selectivity
- Uncertainty on whether cells mediate recognition, represent perceptual events, or relate to conscious perception

**Perceptual Bistability**:
- Ambiguous visual stimuli elicit different perceptions
- Binocular rivalry: Perceptual dominance of one eye's image switches with the other
- Eye-dominance notion fails to account for prolonged periods of perceptual dominance by alternating stimuli

#### Experiment on Binocular Rivalry with Switched Monocular Stimuli Shows Similar Perceptual Alternations to Conventional Rivalry

**Binocular Rivalry: Interocular or Interstimulus Competition?**

**Experimental Paradigm**:
- Observers viewed stimuli through a mirror stereoscope, enabling independent stimulation of each eye
- Stimuli consisted of square patches of sinusoidal gratings oriented orthogonally in the two eyes
- Gratings were exchanged between eyes three times per second to minimize perception of transients
- Gratings flickered at 18 Hz to minimize phi phenomena

**Subjective Dominance Durations**:
- Observers reported prolonged periods (up to seconds) of unitary dominance of each orientation
- Mean dominance duration exceeded two seconds, spanning seven physical exchanges of the gratings
- Subjects rarely saw a grating rapidly changing its orientation at the exchange frequency

**Comparing Rivalry Conditions**:
- Successive dominance phases were independent by autocorrelation and Lathrop test
- Dominance distribution resembled conventional rivalry in humans and monkeys
- Contrast of one stimulus affected mean dominance time of other, regardless of eye in which stronger stimulus was presented

**Implications**:
- Rivalry experienced during "switch" paradigm is indistinguishable from conventional binocular rivalry
- Perceptual alternations during binocular rivalry involve neural machinery of multistable perceptual phenomena
- Dichoptic stimulation can be used to study physiology of perceptual organization and visual awareness in animals.

#### Investigating Neuron Response During Binocular Rivalry in Monkeys

**Monkey Behavior during Binocular Rivalry**
- Monkeys performed consistently above 95% in catching trials of binocular rivalry
- Two additional psychophysical controls:
    - Distribution of dominance-phase durations compared to human observer and previous studies
    - Stimulus strength and eye dominance relation showed consistency between monkey and human studies

**Neurophysiological Findings during Binocular Rivalry**
- Isolated single neurons in central representations of V4, border of striate cortex, and V2 (V1/V2) using specialized glasses
    - Evaluated for orientation selectivity and binocularity by computer-automated procedure
- Testing involved several nonrivalry periods and one rivalry period
- Monkey responded to orientation changes during nonrivalry periods and perceived changes during rivalry

**Responses of Neurons During Binocular Rivalry**
- Four representative examples of cell types encountered: modulating, elevated response, nonpreferred stimulus preferred, and uninfluenced
    - Modulating cells were mostly binocular and had a higher preponderance in V4 than V1/V2
    - Most modulating cells increased firing rate before the monkey reported preferred orientation
- Some neurons became more active when nonpreferred stimulus was perceived, suggesting a role for early extrastriate areas in image segmentation and grouping.

### 28 Visual Imagery and Visual Perception: The Role of Memory and Conscious Awareness Alumit Ishai and Dov Sagi

**Visual Imagery and Visual Perception: The Role of Memory and Conscious Awareness**

**Aspects of Visual Imagery**:
- Natural ability to invent or re-create an experience that resembles the experience of perceiving an object or event, with no retinal input
- Shares functional properties and underlying brain structures with perception

**Brain Studies on Visual Imagery and Perception**:
- Evoked potentials, regional cerebral blood flow, PET, and fMRI studies support the hypothesis that visual imagery and perception have the same neural substrate
- Neuropsychological case studies suggest that visual imagery and perception have overlapping neural substrates
- Brain-damaged patients demonstrate double dissociation between imagery and perception due to subsets of brain regions involved in each system

**Visual Imagery Influence on Visual Perception**:
- Controversial if imagery can facilitate or interfere with visual perception
- Studies show that imagery can reduce perceptual sensitivity, similar to the "Perky effect"
- Imagery may function as a perceptual "anticipation" and speed up perception (Neisser 1976)
- Imagery can facilitate priming in memory tasks (McDermott and Roediger 1994)

**Short-Term Memory's Role in Imagery-Induced Facilitation**:
- Study using a lateral masking detection paradigm showed that:
  - **Imagining masks** flanking the target can reduce detection thresholds, similar to perceptual enhancement
  - This imagery-induced facilitation is based on short-term memory (STM) and depends on recent memory of the mask's presence
  - The imagery-induced facilitation is specific to the orientation and eye used in the task

#### Experiments Expose Low-Level Memory System for Visual Imagery

**Short-Term Memory (STM) vs Long-Term Memory (LTM)**

**Perceptual Task Before Imagery Task**:
- Short-term memory is involved as images are stored and can be reactivated by top-down processes
- Perky effect not seen when no conscious awareness required

**Orientation-Specific Interference**:
- Imagining vertical lines elevates target threshold, horizontal lines have no effect
- Could be due to imaginary lines or experimental procedure

**Excitatory Trace and Interactions between STM and LTM**:
- Presence of lines in perception increases target threshold
- Imagining absent lines from STM does not affect threshold
- Orientation-specific interference seen when comparing perceptual input and representation in LTM
- Additivity specific for imaginary lines or general characteristic? Tested with Gabor targets and masks

**Summary**:
- Low-level memory system subserves imagery-induced facilitation
- Stimulus-specific STM trace enables target threshold reduction only in imagery tasks
- Conscious awareness of perceptual input necessary for imagery-induced interference
- Two types of representation in visual memory: low-level (Gabor) vs structural descriptions (lines)
- Further physiological and neuroimaging studies needed to understand neural correlates of visual awareness.

### 29 How Not to Find the Neural Correlate of Consciousness Ned Block

**Chapter Overview:** This chapter discusses two concepts of consciousness: access-consciousness (a-consciousness) and phenomenal-consciousness (p-consciousness). The author argues that these two concepts may come to the same thing in the brain, despite appearing distinct. The author provides examples from John Searle's reasoning and Crick and Koch's argument on the neural correlate of consciousness to illustrate this point.

**Searle's Contradiction:**
- Searle argues there is no "access sense of consciousness," as Block has misunderstood his position.
- According to Searle, if someone becomes unconscious, the car would crash because they would be unaware of the road and traffic. However, he also acknowledges patients who exhibit goal-directed behavior while being "totally unconscious." This creates an apparent contradiction.

**Crick and Koch's Argument:**
- Crick and Koch argue that visual area V1 is not part of the neural correlate of consciousness because it lacks direct projection to frontal cortex.
- Critics point out that conscious activity may still exist in V1 despite this absence, which raises questions about their argument.

**Two Concepts of Consciousness:**
- The author argues that once the two concepts are separated, Crick and Koch's conclusion turns out to be trivial on one reading and not clearly compelling on another.
- However, the author believes that Crick and Koch's conclusion should still be accepted for a different reason, as they implicitly suggest.
- The considerations raised by Crick and Koch suggest that the two concepts of consciousness may correspond to different neural correlates despite their implicit rejection of this idea.

**Access-consciousness (a-consciousness):** A representation is a-conscious if it is poised for direct control of reasoning, reporting, and action.

**Phenomenal-consciousness (p-consciousness):** Phenomenal-consciousness is just experience; the way something is felt or perceived.

#### Distinction Between P-consciousness and A-consciousness and its Implications for Neural Correlates of Consciousness

**Milner and Goodale's Proposed Model of Consciousness**
- **p-consciousness**: Requires ventral-stream activity plus attention
- The requisite attention can be blocked by parietal lesions
- This account does not conflict with Crick and Koch's claim that V1 is not part of the neural correlate of consciousness (NCC) if activity in V1 is not the object of attentional processes

**Consciousness vs. Access**
- **a-consciousness without p-consciousness**: Possible, limited form
- Example: Noticing a refrigerator going off when you were previously unaware
- Hypothesis: Insufficient attention directed towards the noise at first, leading to indirect control but not direct control
- Degrees of both p-consciousness and access may exist
- Phenomenal experiences can be unconscious in one sense (not poised for access) yet conscious in another (phenomenally experienced)

**Searle's Contradiction**
- Searle argues that becoming unconscious of road details would cause a car crash, but also acknowledges the existence of "unconscious drivers" like Penfield's patient
- Resolution: Penfield's driver may lose p-consciousness but still have sufficient a-consciousness to drive home
- Audience division in understanding consciousness: some mean phenomenal, others mean access or self-consciousness

**Crick and Koch's Argument on Consciousness and V1**
- Neural machinery of visual consciousness harnesses information for direct control of reasoning and decision making
- Frontal areas subserve these functions, V1 does not project directly to frontal cortex
- Conclusion: V1 is not part of the neural correlate of consciousness
- Critique: If by "consciousness," they mean p-consciousness, premise 1 is unjustified; if a-consciousness, the argument is trivial

#### Distinguishing between Neural Correlates of A- and P-Consciousness: Implications for Localization Theory

**Neural Correlates of Consciousness and Visual Processing: A Critique of Crick and Koch's Argument**

**Background:**
- Crick & Koch propose that V1 (primary visual cortex) is not part of the neural correlate of consciousness or visual awareness due to its lack of direct connections to frontal areas.
- They distinguish between a-consciousness (accessible, reportable) and p-consciousness (phenomenal experience).

**Issues with their Argument:**
1. **Substantive vs. Compelling**: Their argument is either not substantive or not compelling.
   - They use examples of retinal representations but do not address the possibility of phenomenal without a-consciousness in V1.
2. **Neural Correlates of Two Kinds of Consciousness**: The neural correlates of p- and a-consciousness might be different.
3. **Two Concepts of Consciousness**: Crick & Koch's use of consciousness is unclear; they seem to mean both p- and a-consciousness at times.
4. **Potential Distinction Between Frontal Cortex and Lower Layers**: The neural correlate of visual p-consciousness could be localized in reverberatory circuits, while a-consciousness involves the frontal cortex.
5. **Misconceptions About Heat Phenomena**: An analogy to Florentine Experimenters' failure to distinguish between temperature and heat; including both concepts in neural correlate is problematic.
6. **Fine-Grained Criteria for Localizing Visual P-Consciousness**: Crick & Koch use specific criteria to localize visual p-consciousness, but this doesn't necessitate the inclusion of non-phenomenal cognitive processing areas in the neural correlate.
7. **Better Reason for Excluding V1 from NCC:**
   - Crick & Koch argue that V1 lacks direct connections to frontal areas; however, there might be a more compelling reason:
     * V1 is an early stage of visual processing and does not involve the higher-level cognitive processes associated with consciousness. This would make it less likely for V1 to be part of the neural correlate of consciousness or visual awareness.

#### Debating the Neural Basis of Phenomenal Consciousness: A Philosophical-Scientific Discussion

**Principles in Investigating Consciousness:**
- Accept claims about personal experience during initial stages of research
- Methodological principle: accept people's reports of their own experience

**V1 Representations and Color Constancy**
- V1 does not exhibit color constancy, but human experience does
- Assuming V1 cells do not exhibit color constancy
  * Represents in V1 may be non-phenomenally conscious

**Neural Correlates of Consciousness:**
- Crick and Koch's work assumes p-consciousness is part of a-consciousness
  * No p- without a-consciousness

**Rationale for Accepting P-Consciousness as Separate from A-Consciousness**
- Blindsight: weak example of a-without p-consciousness
- Reverse Anton's syndrome case might still support Crick and Koch’s conclusion

**Independence of Arguments for P-Consciousness Separation:**
- Regardless of V1 to frontal areas connection

**Possibility of Swamped Color Nonconstant Information in Brain:**
- Broadcasting mechanisms beyond p-consciousness?
- A-consciousness without p-consciousness, but hard to observe

**Value of Philosophical Collaboration with Scientists on Consciousness:**
- Despite mostly scientific issue, collaboration necessary due to conceptual disagreements.

### 30 Speeded Digit Identification under Impaired Perceptual Awareness Syoichi Iwasaki

**Backward Masking and Consciousness**

**The Problem with Overt Responses:**
- Subjective nature of consciousness makes it difficult to assess
- Overt responses, while observable, do not directly reflect internal mental states
- Importance of understanding the relationship between overt responses and consciousness

**Backward Masking as a Tool:**
- Procedure in which target stimulus is followed by masker
- Performance deteriorates with shortening interval between target and masker (typically less than 100ms)
- Explained by transient-sustained interaction theory: two neural channels - slow-conducting sustained channel for identity information, faster transient channel for onset information

**Limitations of Traditional Methods:**
- Uncertainty regarding deeper levels of unconscious semantic activation assessment
- Criticized indirect indices such as priming and autonomic activation

**Experiment Design:**
- Reaction time (RT) task under backward masking condition
- Manual choice responses for odd-even discrimination within 1.5sec
- Five stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) conditions: 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80ms in Experiment 1; -20, 20, 30, 40, and 70ms in Experiment 2 (negative sign means no target for baseline measurement)
- Subjects asked to rate clarity of perceived digits on a scale of 0 to 10 immediately after making response.

**Experiment Results:**
- Response latency and accuracy declined as SOA shortened (Figure 30.1)
- Performance better in right visual field than left
- Individual discrimination accuracy remained above chance even for the shortest SOA
- Debriefing revealed subjects barely aware of digits at shortest SOAs, no spontaneous error correction or comments on errors.

#### Limited Awareness Enables Fast Perception in Masked Digit Identification Experiment

**Study Findings:**
- **Short SOAs (20, 30, 40ms):**
  - Percentage of correct scores showed rapid decline at slower RT segments
  - Reaction time related to accuracy: faster trials were more accurate
- **Experiment 1:**
  - Subjects could discriminate no-target from target presentations
  - All three measures (RT, % correct, visibility score) showed better performance with targets
  - At experiment's end, subjects reported using different numbers based on their level of awareness
    * Level of awareness comparable to blindsight patients
    * Some discrepancies in criteria used for certain numbers
- **Experiment 2:**
  - Performance better when a target was presented than no target
    * Chi-square tests showed significant differences (14.02 for SI, 40.62 for SM, 2.87 for OK)
  - Faster half segment of data showed higher accuracy when target presented but similar performance when no target
- **Conclusion:**
  - Subjects can make speeded discriminatory responses to severely masked digits with minimal awareness
  - Manual response may be under direct control of stimulus parameters rather than consciousness.

### 31 Fast Dynamics of Visibility of Brief Visual Images: The Perceptual-Retouch Viewpoint Talis Bachmann

**Conscious Perception of Visual Images: The Perceptual-Retouch Viewpoint**

**Recognition vs. Awareness**:
- Recognizing or identifying a visual object (A)
    - Allocating a specific representation (A') for the image in specialized cortical modules
    - Categorization presupposes allocating a unique representation
    - Categorization is a choice among potential alternatives
- Observer's becoming aware of A (B/A')

**Dual Process Approach**:
- Some researchers assume a duality in neurophysiological processes for B and A'
- The most popular choice is the **nonspecific thalamus** (e.g., Crick 1984, Bachmann 1984)
- Others reject the dual-process approach or assume widespread brain activity (e.g., Dennett this volume, Chapter 7, Greenfield 1994)

**Two Types of Brain Processes**:
- **Specific System (SP)**:
    - Processes the afferent pathways traversing the lateral geniculate body and project to primary cortical centers
    - Organized in a modular manner, specialized for encoding specific characteristics
    - SP is necessary but insufficient for conscious perception
- **Nonspecific Thalamus/Reticular Formation (NSP)**:
    - Participates in elaborating the afferent information processed in SP
    - Provides presynaptic excitatory influence that helps modulate the activity of SP neurons
    - Converges on the same cortical neurons as SP
    - NSP provides mainly facilitatory effects

#### Perceptual Retouch Model: NSP Modulation and Conscious Visual Perception

**Perceptual Retouch Framework**
- Proposed concept for creating conscious quality in perceptual representations
- Model: PR (Perceptual Retouch)
- Two types of processes: SP (Sensory Processing) and NSP (Nonspecific Modulation)

**Features of the Perceptual Retouch Model:**
1. Slower latency of main portion of ascending NSP modulation compared to EPSPs in cortical SP units
2. Coarse spatial resolution of receptive fields of M compared to fine receptive fields of D (specific encoding units)
3. Spatially selective mode of direction of NSP modulation from M to D

**Impact on Conscious Perception:**
- Invariant system of modulation, M, can service alternative specific encoding units, D(S1) and D(S2), which carry signals from different visual images S1 and S2
- Slower subprocess within the domain of B (NSP modulation) necessary for conscious quality is faster with short stimulus intervals
- Favored perception: With brief, consecutive stimuli, S2 is favored in conscious perception due to effective time difference between EPSPs and NSP modulation from M.

**Evidence Favoring Predictions:**
1. Mutual masking: Equal visibility of stimuli S1 and S2 with short SOAs (<20-30ms) when intensities are compatible, resulting in integrative masking and no dominant perception.
2. Metacontrast: Target stimulus S1 is easily visible at short SOAs due to its high intensity compared to S2, but with intermediate SOAs (40-90ms), S2 dominates conscious perception over S1.
3. Speeding up of subjective moment for the perceived stimulus: Rapidly alternating visual stimuli result in faster response times and increased visibility of the later-presented stimulus (S2).

#### Neural Processing Theory: Proactive Perception and Temporal Phenomena

**Study Findings and Interpretations**

**Paradoxical Result in Masking**:
- B/A' type of modulatory process from M of NSP thalamus is necessary for conscious quality of stimulus representations
- This process begins to elaborate on EPSPs of D(S1) and D(S2) when the EPSP of D(S1) has decayed much more than that of D(S2)
- Consequences: 
  - S2 recognition is strong, with substantial deprivation of S1 from clear representation in intermediate SOAs (SOAs of 50 msec and 80 msec)
  - In metacontrast tasks, intermediate intervals provide lowest ratings or worst performance for identifying S1 compared to S2
- With SOAs > 150 msec, two independent B/A' processes are executed for each stimulus, resulting in clear visibility at different moments

**Mutual Masking Study with Parkinsonian Patients**:
- Unusually strong S1 dominance in perception without typical relative efficiency pattern between S1 and S2
- Interpreted as reflecting dopaminergic or cholinergic system deficiency, or direct result from NSP stimulation
- Contrasts with study on non-treated parkinsonian patients showing typical mutual masking functions

**Proactive Enhancement of Contrast and Speeding-Up Effect**:
- Average contrast ratings of S2 increase relative to single condition at intermediate SOAs
- Explained by the fact that modulatory impulses from S1 reach D(S2) presynaptic sites when EPSP level is maximized, leading to more frequent firing and higher cumulative discharges
- Predicted effect: S2 will establish visibility earlier in conscious awareness compared to single exposure condition
- Tested using temporal order judgments (TOJ) and reaction time (RT) measures

**Fröhlich Effect**:
- A laterally moving visual stimulus is perceived not at the objective spatial position but shifted toward the direction of motion
- Explained by the fact that consciousness-related modulation mediates the first moment of visibility, representing the stimulus position as advanced in space

**Tandem Effect and Visuo-Spatial Attention**:
- Tandem effect: pair of bars moving laterally appear simultaneously in subjective space and time with optimal speed and interstimulus distance
- Explained by PR theory's two-process account of SP encoding and NSP modulation, resulting in compression of space and time.

#### Conscious Perception and Attention: A Physiological Approach to the "Hard Problem" of Perceptual Awareness

**Overview:**
- The S1 and S2 system allows for a faster conscious representation of trailing information compared to leading information, resulting in compression of subjective space-time
- Facilitation effect in selective spatial attention through pre-cues
- Binocular rivalry: two incompatible visual images presented result in alternating conscious visibility and potential processing of suppressed images
- Abnormal fusion phenomenon: two brief competing stimuli can amalgamate into a composite percept.

**S1 and S2 System:**
- Leading S1 lives more "in the past" with subjective impression
- Trailing S2 lives less "in the past" and shifts closer to S1 in conscious representation due to shorter delay for experiencing it
- Optimal intervals for facilitating attention through physical pre-cues are 60-150ms

**Selective Spatial Attention:**
- Pre-cue facilitates target processing, resulting in speeded up perception or increased sensitivity
- Repeated experimental studies on selective spatial attention show that a peripheral pre-cue enhances target processing when presented before the target within optimal SOA (optimal stimulus onset asynchrony).

**Binocular Rivalry:**
- Two incompatible visual images presented to different eyes result in alternating conscious visibility of images and potential processing of suppressed image information
- Studies show that with very short SOAs, the NSP (nonspecific modulation) necessary for rendering conscious quality can be deprived of time for alternative retouch of perceptual objects, resulting in an abnormal fusion phenomenon where two brief competing stimuli amalgamate into a composite percept.

**Motion Perception:**
- Studies on motion analysis specific systems and attention show interdependence between the two
- Attention can modulate perception of motion-inducing displays
- Similar time course functions of apparent motion, metacontrast, and space-time phenomena suggest potential mediating role of non-specific modulation (NSP) of perceptual objects.

**Conclusion:**
- Author bypasses the "hard problem" to focus on pre-requisites for brief visual signals to achieve conscious visibility
- Approach may be criticized as too physiological by traditional psychologists or too speculative and psychophysical by neurophysiologists and neurologists.
- Interdisciplinary approaches incorporating subjective and objective data in a unified framework are necessary for understanding the explanatory gap surrounding perceptual awareness.

### 32 Double-Judgment Psychophysics for Research on Consciousness: Application to Blindsight Stanley A. Klein

**Psychophysics for Research on Consciousness: Double-Judgment Psychophysical Methodology**

**Background:**
- Developed around 1960 to objectively study subjectivity in vision research
- Goal: clarify experiments on blindsight, a condition where individuals can make visual discriminations without visual awareness

**Psychophysics Basics:**
- Double-judgment methodology for studying subjective thresholds and criterion issues

**Single Judgment (Pure Detection):**
- Detecting a dim flash of light: hit rate, ph, measured at various stimulus levels
- Threshold: subjective threshold (Thsubjective) = hit rate of 50%
- Pre-1960 concerns: criterion problem and guessing rate (pf), false-alarm rate
- Two types of corrections used: high-threshold correction (P) and signal-detection correction (d')

**Objective Threshold (Thobjective):**
- Relative independence from subject's criterion or false-alarm rate
- Measured using z-scores: zh for hits and zf for false alarms
- d' = zh - zf (32.2)
- Determines detectability of a stimulus

**Thresholds:**
- Absolute threshold: transition from dead zone to linear zone (1% contrast)
- Objective threshold: where zh = zf + 1, corresponding to d' = 1
- Subjective threshold: hit rate of 50% or ph = 50%
- Phenomenal threshold: visual subjective awareness of the stimulus (may be below subjective threshold in blindsight cases)

#### Signal Detection Theory and Blindsight: Interpreting Visual Stimuli Below Perception Threshold

**Blindsight: Detection and Identification**

**Blindsight**: Observer claims to be blind but can make forced-choice identification judgments despite losing part of visual cortex or having normal vision.

**Experiment Design**:
- Present spot in position P1 or P2 on 1/3 of trials, no stimulus on remaining trials
- Observer makes yes/no detection decision and P1 vs P2 location judgment even when claiming not to see the spot

**Observer Responses**: Five types of observers and their responses:
1. Blind observer
   - No difference between responses to light flash and blank stimulus (same as blind)
2. High-threshold observer (guesses if no detection)
3. Signal-detection (equal-variance) observer
4. Idealized blindsight observer (not using detection information)
5. Observer with different criterion from idealized blindsight

**Calculating Detection and Identification Performance**:
- **Detection d' (d')**: Hit rate based on P1 or P2 responses, false-alarm rate based on blank stimulus trials
- **Identification d' (dI)**: Separately calculated for yes and no responses

**Observers' Performance**:
1. Blind observer: Same response to all stimuli (no detection threshold)
2. High-threshold observer: Guesses if no detection, following high-threshold theory
3. Signal-detection observer: Uses position information even below criterion, exhibiting blindsight
4. Idealized blindsight observer: No visual awareness but uses nonvisual cues for identification
5. Observer with different criterion from idealized blindsight: Same performance as idealized blindsight but with a different criterion
6. Last observer (misinterpreted instructions or using nonvisual information) may exhibit blindsight behavior despite objective measurements suggesting otherwise.
7. Methodology in actual research on blindsight is sometimes sloppy, neglecting careful psychophysical methods.

#### Blindsight Research and Controversies: Eye Movement Studies

**Blindsight Studies and Controversial Issues**

**More Research Needed**:
- Use double-judgment signal-detection methods like those in Tables 32.1 and 32.2
- Stoerig, Hobner, and Poppel (1985) study measured hit rates for a range of false-alarm rates and found d' values between .1 and .9
- These values are above the absolute threshold but below the objective threshold of dD = 1
- At these low d' levels, observer is phenomenally blind; detection d', dD values must be 2 or above to see stimuli
- Uncertain if subject can discriminate X from O with identification dI greater than 1 when detection d', dD are less than 1
- It would be useful to study an observer's objective, subjective, and phenomenal detection thresholds
- Clarity needed in blindsight studies by sharpening definitions of multiple thresholds

**Blindsight in Normal Observers**:
- Found blindsight in normal individuals when eye movements used as motor response
- Experiment by Scott Stevenson at UC Berkeley: presented dynamic random dot patterns to both eyes, relative shift (disparity), and task was to keep patterns fused
- Vertical disparity: observers had no awareness of motion or eyes for vertical, but eyes moved appropriately; blindsight case
- Horizontal disparity: eyes made correct vergence eye movements, observers had strong phenomenal awareness of depth corresponding to disparity
- Eye movement system responds without subjective awareness, while fusion requires V1 processing is debated
- Rafal et al. (1990) showed stimulus in blind temporal field influences eye movements; blindsight individuals can perform visual discriminations, but controlled experiments needed

**Discussion**:
- Further research and discussion among researchers and philosophers on controversial issues associated with blindsight
- Recent studies by Stoerig and Cowey (1997) and Cowey and Stoerig (1997) increase confidence in real nature of blindsight, but need extension to object discrimination.

### 33 Consciousness, and Commentaries Lawrence Weiskrant

**Blindsight Phenomenon and Consciousness**
* **Neuropsychological states revealing unconscious processes:** Blindsight phenomenon, where capacities can remain after brain damage without patient's awareness (Weiskrantz 1991, 1997)
* **Two types of visual processing**: Geniculostriate pathway and non-geniculate components (Cowey and Stoerig 1991), affecting various regions in the brain.
* **Blindsight in humans:** Despite similarities to monkey's visual system, some patients report being blind after cortex damage.
* **Testing approaches:** Forced-choice discrimination, reaching actions, or eye movements instead of oral instructions for testing.
* **Discovering Blindsight**: Pöppel et al. (1973) studied eye movements and positive correlation with stimuli position; Weiskrantz et al. (1974) confirmed findings and explored various approaches.
* **Variations in blindsight:** Complex incidence and variations not fully settled (Weiskrantz 1995, 1996).
* **Subject G.Y.**: Brain-damaged as a child, macular sparing of vision in affected field, no excitation in region corresponding to the macular sparing during testing (Barbur et al. 1993; Sahraie et al. 1997).
* **Color discrimination without conscious awareness:** Subjects can discriminate colors but never report experience (Stoerig and Cowey 1992; Brent, Kennard, and Ruddock 1994).
* **Blindsight type 1 versus type 2**: Type 1: no reported experience; Type 2: awareness of rapid transient events (Barbur et al. 1993, Weiskrantz et al. 1997).
* **Distinction between types:** Type 2 is easier to study and has received more experimental attention than Type 1 due to its veridical nature.

#### Comparing Brain Activity in Type 1 & 2 Blindsight using fMRI

**Experiment on Type 1 vs. Type 2 Blindsight in G.Y.**
- Differences between Type 1 and Type 2 blindsight:
  - Type 1: subject is aware of event but cannot see it
  - Type 2: subject has no experience or awareness of event
- Misunderstanding of G.Y.'s abilities in "Commentary Paradigm"
  - Dennett reported that G.Y. could guess direction of slow laser spot movement without awareness (Dennett, 1991)
  - This experiment never actually done with G.Y. due to challenges in controlling transients and moving laser smoothly
- Reasons for Performing Experiment
  **Comparing Type 1 and Type 2 Performance**
    - Need to measure discrimination and assess awareness
    - Provide subject with response keys
  **Functional MRI Comparison of Brain Activity**
    - Possibility of different patterns in aware vs. unaware conditions
- Results
  *Performance*
    - G.Y. can perform well by guessing direction even without awareness (Weiskrantz et al., 1995)
  *Brain Imaging*
    - Different patterns of brain activity in type 1 vs. type 2 modes (Sahraie et al., 1997)
      - Both share activity in areas 18 and 19 but differ in frontal cortex activation and overlap with sighted half field.
    - Elevated superior colliculus activity only seen in type 1 mode
- Caution: results must be treated with caution, further analysis required.

#### Animals with V1 lesions demonstrate blindsight behaviorally, linking animal consciousness research to human blindsight studies.

**Superior Colliculus:**
- Critical for sustaining function after visual cortex damage (Mohler and Wurtz 1977)
- Not a candidate for an awareness center due to subtle changes with lesions
- Activity observed only in "unaware" mode (blindsight 1)

**Areas 18 and 19:**
- Necessary for awareness, but not sufficient
- Required for responding on a commentary key or its equivalent
- Commentary is essential component of awareness meaning

**Commentaries:**
- Essential for determining awareness offline
- Must be offline in neuropsychological syndromes with covert processing contrasted with overt processing
- Could involve various patterns of activity removed from visual processing cortices
- Links to "higher-order thoughts" necessary for rendering a thought conscious (Rosenthal 1992)

**Imaging Conscious vs. Nonconscious States:**
- Allows investigation into the patterns of activity in such a process
- Offline questioning of monkeys with unilateral V1 lesions about retained capacities may answer whether they have blindsight.

**Animals and Blindsight:**
- Monkeys with unilateral V1 lesions treat visual targets as nonlights, similar to human blindsight subjects.

## VI BIOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND CONSCIOUSNESS

**Biology, Evolution, and Consciousness**

**Overview:**
- Consciousness exists only in living systems
- Understanding life may be key to grasping consciousness
- Debate around what life is and its relationship to consciousness

**What Is Life?**
- Molecular basis: a "strange, aperiodic crystal" or self-organizing solitons/coherent phonons
- Artificial life (AL) simulation of self-organization in computers
- Darwinism quelled animistic views of vital force and consciousness in living systems
- Alternative perspective: Life as a grand, planetary process

**Evolutionary Emergence of Consciousness:**
- Early consciousness: simple coelenterates and learning abilities
- Focus on mammals, nonhuman primates
- Evidence from brain size, emergent learning, language
- Rudimentary consciousness in bacteria with self-organizing processes
- Cytoskeleton plays a role in movement, perception, differentiation

**Eukaryotic Organisms:**
- Euglena gracilis: specialized cytoskeletal (flagellar) photoreceptor
- Classical nonlinear dynamics explain cytoskeletal function
- Evolution of consciousness coincided with Cambrian explosion and emergence of complex nervous systems

**Significance:**
- Understanding life crucial for grasping consciousness
- Consciousness an exclusive feature of living systems until proven otherwise in AI.

### 34 Evolution of Intelligence, Language, and Other Emergent Processes for Consciousness: A Comparative Perspective James E. King, Duane M. Rumbaugh, an

**Evolution of Intelligence, Language, and Other Emergent Processes for Consciousness: A Comparative Perspective**

**Psychologists' Fascination with Consciousness**:
- Ability to recognize and reflect upon oneself
- Experience intentional states
- Possibly recognize these states in others

**Consciousness vs. Romanes's Criterion of Mind**:
- Adaptive behavior, even if complex, is not indicative of mind or consciousness if controlled by "particular stimulations" (Romanes 1888)
- Consciousness and mind begin to emerge during evolutionary development when animals become capable of making adaptive adjustments consistent with their own past experiences (learning)

**Instrumental Conditioning and the Capacitor Model**:
- Simplest form of learning showing independence from Romanes's particular stimulations
- Instrumental conditioning: Behavior followed by a consequence that increases or decreases future likelihood
- Thorndike's law of effect: Response strength increases with number of reinforced responses
- Capacitor model provides a baseline against which to assess animals' abilities to adapt independently

**Emancipation from the Capacitor Model**:
- Evidence of mammalian emancipation from strict control by the capacitor model emerged in the 1930s
- **Latent learning**: Rats showed increased performance after a reward was introduced, suggesting behavior is an expression of knowledge about related events (rewards and punishers)
- **Silent learning**: Learning can occur in the absence of manifestation of the learned response
- **Partial reinforcement effect (PRE)**: The number of trials to extinction increases as the proportion of reinforced responses decreases

#### Emergent Learning in Nonhuman Primates: Win-Stay, Lose-Shift Discrimination Learning Sets

**The Predictive Relating Effect (PRE)**
- **Robust effect**: demonstrated across many mammalian and avian taxa
- **Pervasive effect**: occurs in both partially reinforced and continuously reinforced groups
- Paradox 1: Response strength increases as the number of reinforced responses decreases
- Paradox 2: Maximizing during probability learning

**Maximizing During Probability Learning**
- Subjects learn to choose the **favored alternative (S+)** on a proportion of trials approaching 1.0
- Violates the **capacitor model of learning**
- Examples: rhesus monkeys maximizing with payoff probabilities as similar as 55% and 45%
- Paradoxical nature occurs because the maximizing subject learns to avoid responses that were previously reinforced

**Conclusions from Learning Research**
1. **External reinforcement of a response is not necessary for learning**; it may even impair learning
2. A learned response does not have to occur during the time in which the learning takes place
3. Decrease in number of reinforcements can increase the strength of a learned response
4. Effects of rewarding a response can be suppressed and thereby reduce the probability of the response

**Emergent Learning in Nonhuman Primates**
- Harlow's rhesus monkeys achieved nearly perfect performances on object discrimination problems (1940s)
- "Discrimination learning set": a rule learned that could be applied to unlimited problems
- Characterized as "emergent" learning: acquisition of new adaptive capabilities or patterns of responding
- Emergents generalize based on rules, not conventional stimulus/response generalization
- Examples: transfer suppression (decreased stimulus generalization) and rapid learning/forgetting in rhesus monkeys.

#### Emergence of Language in Primates: Chimps' Learning Capabilities

**Primate Learning Abilities and Transfer Index (TI)**

**Background:**
- Large body of research data on species' performance with discrimination learning sets doesn't confirm assumption about brain size and intelligence
- Learning set-related measure, Transfer Index (TI), successful in discriminating primate species based on their relative brain size

**Transfer Index (TI)**:
- Based on sequence of discrimination reversal problems
- Acquisition phase followed by constant number of reversal trials with reward values reversed
- Mean proportion of correct responses on all reversals divided by 0.67 or 0.84 to yield two types of TI
- Classic transfer theory and capacitor model predict lower 84% TI due to more errors during reversal, but primates display positive transfer (except prosimians)

**Brain Size and Evolutionary Adaptation:**
- Big animals have bigger brains than small ones
- Most brain weight variation accounted for by body weight
- Primate species, especially great apes, have more neurons relative to their body weight
- Active growth mode in primate evolution leads to deviation from logarithmic function and larger isocortex size
- Rumbaugh's TI values related to extra brain volume and neuron count in primates

**Numerical Cognition in Rhesus Monkeys:**
- Two monkeys learned complete set of relative values for numerals 0–9 through training and testing
- Results indicate understanding of numerical cognition beyond specific associations

**Language as Emergent Learning**:
- Humans' ability to use language with constantly changing syntax in various contexts different from animal learning abilities
- Chimpanzees and bonobos, our closest human ancestors, might have approximated human language competence
- Evolution of consciousness, emergent learning, and language aptitude likely linked
- Brain endocasts suggest left temporal gyrus expansion in humans around 2–3 million years ago.

#### Apes Approaching Human Language Capabilities Through Lexigrams and Spoken English.

**Early Research on Ape Language**

**Chimpanzee Language Studies**:
- Emphasized training chimps to use manual signs or noniconic/arbitrary symbols to represent objects
- Chimps achieved impressive vocabularies and facility in using symbols in a variety of situations
- Showed more sophisticated learning than previous complex studies on hidden rewards

**Limitations of Ape Language Studies**:
- Lack of association between symbols and internal representation/meaning/semanticity
- Similar to a pigeon's learned association between stimulus, response, and outcome (e.g., peck red for food)

**Semantics in Chimpanzees**:
- **Semantic content** depends on the symbols having representational meaning
- Sherman and Austin chimps: Learned to associate arbitrary geometrical symbols (lexigrams) with 3 foods, tools; Could use lexigrams to classify and label other objects
- Cross-modal identification without prior training indicates semantic understanding

**Bonobo Kanzi's Language Abilities**:
- Proficient in comprehension of spoken English without formal training
- Understood syntax of sentences, not just words
- Responded correctly to novel sentence requests (70% accuracy)
- Generativity: Able to produce language by combining lexigrams and gestures
- Kanzi's abilities indicate the "brink" of human language

**Conclusion**:
- No "large, glaring discontinuity" between animal and human learning/cognitive abilities
- Evolution of cognitive abilities was slow, gradual, and conservative
- Romanes was correct that consciousness emerged with learned actions independent of reflexes
- Continuity in the evolutionary development of learning and language suggests consciousness evolved along similar paths

### 35 Bacteria as Tools for Studies of Consciousness Victor Norris

**Bacteria as Tools for Studies of Consciousness**

**Possible Value of Bacteria in Consciousness Studies**:
- Bacteria can be used to explore various hypotheses related to consciousness
- Hypotheses are not mutually exclusive
- Consciousness may act as an organizing force, emerging from critical mass/density and helping generate coherent oscillations (e.g., neuronal membranes)
- Understanding oscillations may require concepts like piezoelectricity
- Function for consciousness at single-cell level can be proposed for coherent oscillations

**Advantages of Bacteria as Model Systems**:
- **Escherichia coli (E. coli)** is more easily manipulated and better understood than many other organisms
- E. coli genome nearly sequenced, proteins can be readily identified by electrophoretic properties
- Bacteria are simple compared to computers but complex compared to machines
- E. coli contains a compact chromosome (4.7 million base pairs) and accomplishes the cell cycle in 17 minutes

**Similarities Between Bacteria and Higher Cells**:
- Both contain DNA, RNA, proteins, polyamines, and membranes composed of phospholipids and proteins
- Cell wall/cytoskeleton can resist turgor pressure
- **Enzoskeleton**: interlinked and interlaced assembly of enzyme complexes that channels metabolites and connects membranes/nucleic acids
- Includes eukaryotic-like cytoskeletal structures and elements like the FtsZ protein (tubulin-like)

**Signaling Mechanisms in Bacteria**:
- Calcium-based system: primary/secondary transporters, voltage-operated calcium channels, calmodulin-like proteins
- Phosphorylation-based system: kinases present in bacteria (as in eukaryotes)

#### Exploring Consciousness in Bacteria: Regulation of Cell Cycle, Differentiation, and Origins

**Bacterial Chemotaxis and Motility:**
- Involves about 50 genes in E. coli (Manson 1992)
- Cytoskeleton may act as a nervous system for single-celled eukaryotes (Hameroff 1994)
- Chemotaxis involves elements found in eukaryotic chemotaxis, such as calcium and voltage-operated calcium channels (Tisa et al. 1993)

**Possible Associations Between Consciousness and Chemotaxis:**
- FtsZ protein disruption inhibits chemotaxis
- Cycling of information in cell cycle may be associated with consciousness
- Cell division, differentiation, origin of life also involve major organizational changes

**Bacterial Cell Cycle:**
- Tubulin-like protein FtsZ forms a ring during cell division
- Unclear mechanism regulating the bacterial cell cycle
- Speculative possibility: Consciousness may be involved in organizing the cell cycle

**Other Candidate Processes for Conscious Involvement:**
- Differentiation: Radical changes in organization of chromosomes and membranes
- Origin of life: Regulation of first cells' growth, multiplication, and differentiation by consciousness itself

**Cosmic Level Hypotheses:**
- Earth as a superorganism with geophysiological regulation involving complex feedback between biota and physical world
- Consciousness in global entity: Bacteria could be relevant if Earth is conscious

**Organizing Force of Consciousness:**
- Transmits, receives, and condenses organization to common pattern irrespective of physical correlates
- Proportional to density of information, similar to gravity (Norris 1996)

**Metaforce Recruiting Other Organizing Forces:**
- Consciousness recruits or creates other forces for producing organizations with quasidivine status.

#### Exploring Bacterial Oscillations as Neural Correlates of Consciousness.

**Hypotheses Regarding Consciousness**

**Hypothesis 6:**
- Circumvents problem of finding evidence for Hypothesis 5
- Consciousness has recruited a molecular mechanism, even if it's not the ppGpp single-stranded DNA mechanism
- Reformation of "Life will find a way" at bacterial level
- At brain level, consciousness as a metaforce may be accepted, proportional to organization in entity generating it (Hypothesis 5)

**Hypothesis 7:**
- Reported nonchemical communication between bacteria
- Signal involves bacterial walls
- Potential relevance to studies of consciousness and certain psychic phenomena
- Similar signals used by neurons possible

**Hypothesis 8:**
- Coherence important for intracellular organization, membrane behavior, and consciousness
- Consciousness generated by coherent oscillations of neuronal membranes (Norris 1996)
- Reasoning:
  1. Neuron's membrane has specific spatial distribution due to proteolipid domains
  2. Membrane vibrates during firing, emitting signals at specific frequencies reflecting domain distribution
  3. Other neurons converge on same set of frequencies, coupling them into thoughts and streams of thoughts
  4. Neurons with similar patterns of vibration become physically connected via synapses or other means
- Potential application to bacteria: Coherent oscillations in biological processes ancestral to neural correlates of consciousness, such as cell cycle regulation or protein folding
- Reports on growth decrease and lytic cycle induction of E. coli and other organisms at specific microwave frequencies (Webb 1979; Berteaud et al. 1975; Grundler 1981) should be confirmed or discounted by further experimentation

### 36 Nonlinear Dynamics in the Photoreceptor of the Unicellular Alga Euglena gracilis: An Application to the Evolutionary Aspects of Consciousness Ezio 

**Nonlinear Dynamics in Photoreceptor of Unicellular Alga Euglena gracilis: An Application to Evolutionary Aspects of Consciousness**

**Background:**
- Recent hypotheses suggest microtubules (MT) play role in consciousness
- Existing theories not falsifiable or coherent with current scientific knowledge
- Need for a theory accounting for standard MT applications before exploring consciousness theories

**Methodology:**
- Focus on understanding MT dynamics in simple behavioral responses, e.g., phototaxis in Euglena gracilis
- Developed new model of MT dynamics based on classic nonlinear physics (Insinna et al., 1996)

**Microtubules and Classic Nonlinear Dynamics:**
- Ubiquitous components of eukaryotic cells, associated with various dynamic phenomena
- Lack of a plausible model accounting for synchronization of contraction-motility process in dynamic cell processes

**Proposed Model:**
- Based on classic nonlinear physics
- Microtubules viewed as array of dipole moment triangles arising from mobile electrons in hydrophobic pockets of tubulin dimer
- Electron reversal mechanism likely triggered by GTP-GDP hydrolysis
- Mobile electrons may form conduction band, leading to current flows along MT protofilaments or specific helical paths of microtubular lattice (Figure 36.1)

**Application to Euglena's Phototactic Behavior:**
- Unicellular organism displays simple perceptive functions that can be extrapolated to instinctive intelligent behavior
- Several attempts failed to establish connection between photoreceptor mechanism, flagellum dynamics, and Euglena's various phototactic strategies due to lack of understanding molecular dynamics of the flagellum

**Implications:**
- Charge transfer-dependent protein activation at base of all MT-driven motility processes
- Postulated that MT are responsible for retrograde vesicle transport through a mechanism involving charge transfer and conformational changes in both MT binding site and dynein motor domain (Figure 36.2).

#### Microtubular Motor Theory: Coordinating Axonemal Components in Ciliary and Flagellar Beating

**Microtubular Motors (MTM) in Ciliary and Flagellar Beating**
- **Coordination of flagellar beating**:
  - Charge transfer inside MTM can account for ciliary and flagellar beating
  - Displacement of charges occurs distally (from base to tip) in axoneme fibers
  - Potential difference maintained between axoneme tip and cell interior through membrane domains and capping structures
- **Sliding MT hypothesis**:
  - Cannot account for coordination of axonemal components responsible for bending wave generation
  - Propagation of bending wave requires sequential activation of dynein arms on each doublet and coordination of entire force-generating mechanism
- **MTM Model**:
  - Coordinated by electron transfer in MTB subfibers to which dynein arm heads are attached
  - Activation of motor domain in dynein arm occurs through charge-transfer signaling at attachment site on MTB subfiber
  - Conformational change at distal part of motor domain plays major role in synchronization
- **Radial spokes and gating mechanism**:
  - Radial spokehead ATPase needed for signaling to, and control of, MT doublet to which radial spoke is attached distally
  - Distal conformational change of radial spokes acts as gating mechanism for charge transfer through MT B subfibers
- **Role of paraxial rod (PAR)**:
  - Coiled into a left-handed helix with a pitch of 45 degrees and lattice periodicity of 54 nm
  - ATPase activity detected in rod of Euglena
  - Goblet-like projections link PAR to axoneme MT doublets, suggesting charge-transfer dependency

#### Phototactic Response Mechanism in Euglena Gracilis: Charge Transfer and ATP Hydrolysis

**The Paraflagellar Body (PFS) and Phototaxis in Euglena gracilis**

**Paraflagellar Body (PFS)**
- Visible, ovoidal protuberance on motile emergent flagellum
- Located between reservoir and canal
- Contains rhodopsin molecules forming a crystalline-like lamellar structure
- Role in photoreception confirmed through presence of rhodopsin

**Phototaxis in Euglena gracilis**
- Protist moves by beating flagellum (EF)
  - 50 mm long and 10 mm wide cell
  - Helical path with frequency 1.2 to 1.8 Hz
- Positive phototaxis: towards light source
  * Stigma acts as shading device
    + Casts shadow on PFS triggers flagellum erection
    + Results in direction change
- Negative phototaxis: away from light source
  * Complete bleaching of rhodopsin molecules
    + Stops charge transfer inside PAR filaments
    + Increases membrane conductance to Ca++
      + Flagellum in state of rigor, then beats reversely
      + Calmodulin regulates process
- Charge transfer control implemented through goblet-shaped projections on axoneme doublets 1-3
  * Activated by distally directed charge transfer inside PAR filaments
  * Controls axonemal current flow

**Photoreceptor Mechanism in Euglena gracilis**
- Bleaching of rhodopsin molecules in PFS induces changes in charge transfer capability of PAR filaments
- ATPase activity detected in rod of Euglena by Piccinni et al. (1975)
  * Charge transfer activates ATPase of gate projection on paraxial rod
  * ATP hydrolysis induces conformational change in distal part of gate projection
  * Current flow occurs as long as electron flow in PAR continuously activates ATP hydrolysis

**Model of Euglena's Phototactic Response to Light Changes**
- Incoming light bleaches rhodopsin molecules contained in PFS
- Enzymatic cascade induces changes in charge transfer capability of PAR filaments
- ATP hydrolysis activates axonemal current flow through gate projections on axoneme doublets 1-3
  * Charge transfer inside PAR and subsequent ATP hydrolysis are light dependent
  * Control pathway likely involves more than one MT doublet
- Current flow in axonemal MT doublets proportionally increases with light impingement, determines beat frequency of flagellum
- Casting a shadow on stigma produces decrease in ATP hydrolysis and current flow in MT doublets, with subsequent progressive stiffening of axonemal components
  * Flagellum beats reversely when light source is too intense (shock reaction)
    + Stops charge transfer inside PAR filaments
    + Results in complete stiffening of flagellum
    + Protozoan swims away from light source via depolarization and reversal of MTM.

#### Evolutionary Origin of Perception and Consciousness in Euglena

**Evolutionary Pathway of Vertebrate Photoreceptors**
- **Eakin (1968)** advanced that vertebrate photoreceptors and sophisticated sensory neurons with ciliary structures have origins in Euglena
- Studying primitive organisms like Euglena is necessary to understand perception evolution

**MT Model Application to Euglena**
- Classic nonlinear dynamics provides a consistent and heuristic model for MT functioning
- No need for global macroscopic quantum-coherent states, although electron tunneling may be involved
- Macroscopic quantum states might hinder local interactions needed for sequential protein activation

**Euglena's Protoeye Functioning**
- Primitive form of sensory neuron and perception/sensory-motor reaction
- Evolutionary steps: MT centrioles in ciliated cells, sensory neurons, neuronal networks, brain

**Complex Processing of External Stimuli in Euglena**
- MTM conduction state used to influence membrane conductivity and cell polarization
- Firing of afferent neurons depends on MTM activity
- Neurons for data storage and processing sensory stimuli are crucial for higher forms of behavior
- Nonlinear dynamics offers a scientifically tenable alternative to quantum mechanics in studying perceptive processes and consciousness

**Consciousness Evolution**
- Consciousness has evolved parallel to sensory functions development
- Cannot separate consciousness from its evolutionary context
- Perceptive functions play an undeniable role in consciousness development
- Historical approach to consciousness may help bridge mind and matter, biological and psychic functions

**Euglena's Instinctual Behavior and Awareness**
- Instincts linked with perceptive (and proprioceptive) capabilities of animate creature
- Question of how these capabilities relate to consciousness not answered at this stage of investigations
- Instincts may have emerged in a feedback loop, serving movement and creating behavioral expression in a mutual creative process
- Evolutionary dynamics led to differentiated collective psychic realm containing all evolutionary steps towards higher forms of behavior and consciousness (Jung's collective unconscious)

### 37 Did Consciousness Cause the Cambrian Evolutionary Explosion? Stuart R. Hameroff

**Consciousness and Evolution: Cambrian Explosion**

**Cambrian Explosion**
- Occurred about 540 million years ago, marking a rapid evolution of diverse life forms
- Preceded by slow evolution for the first 3.5 billion years
- Questions regarding the cause of this sudden explosion in species

**Possible Theories on Causes**
1. Climate change and environmental factors: Wray et al. (1996) suggest a more linear process, but constant nucleotide substitution rate may not apply.
2. Biological genetic complexity threshold: Kauffman (1995), Dawkins (1989).
3. Behavior influencing evolution: Schrödinger (1958), Dennett (1995), Margulis and Sagan (1995).
   * Lamarckian theory discredited due to lack of evidence for direct genetic modification.
   * Indirect influence through survival, cooperation, and facilitating mutations.
4. Cytoskeleton and microtubules (MT) playing a role in evolution: Hameroff and Penrose (1996a), Tuszynski et al. (1995).

**Cytoskeleton**
- Internal scaffolding of each eukaryotic cell
- Includes MT, actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and complex arrays like centrioles, cilia, flagella, axonemes
- Made up of dynamic networks that define cell shape and functions
- Links to cognitive processes through theoretical models and simulations (Dayhoff et al. 1994; Hameroff and Penrose 1996a)
- Possible involvement in quantum computing systems (Rasmussen et al. 1990; Jibu et al. 1994).

**Paramecia: Examples of Intelligent Behavior**
- Perform complex adaptive movements such as seeking food, avoiding obstacles and predators, identifying mates
- No synapses or neural networks; rely on cytoskeleton for sensation, locomotion, information processing.

#### Evolution of Cytoskeleton and Consciousness through the Cambrian Explosion.

**Microtubules (MT) and Primitive Appendages:**
- Composed of microtubules arranged as doublets or triplets in megacylinders
- Found in centrioles, cilia, and flagella
- Centrioles: two perpendicular arrayed MT megacylinders controlling cell cycles and mitosis
- Cilia: membrane-covered megacylinder of nine MT doublets with a central motor pair for locomotion
- Flagella: same 9 + 2 arrangement as cilia but longer and specialized for rapid movement
- Originated in spirochetes prior to eukaryotes, providing agency and differentiation

**Role of Cytoskeleton:**
- Provides internal organization and variation in cell shape
- Separates chromosomes during mitosis
- Activates genes through cooperative function with the nucleus
- Enables differentiation and emergence of specialized tissues and organs
- Facilitates intercellular communication, such as gap junctions or electrotonic synapses

**Evolution of Consciousness:**
- Complexity on Earth increased due to selection and organism choices (free will)
- Primitive consciousness may have provided advantages in predator-prey dynamics and survival
- Early Cambrian organisms had simple nervous systems with hundreds of neurons and primitive vision
- Axonemes, tubelike alimentary systems, and spinelike extensions suggested the capability for agency and intelligence behavior.

**Consciousness and Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR):**
- A model suggesting consciousness emerges from a self-organizing Planck-scale quantum process
- Raw "protoconscious" information encoded in space-time geometry at the fundamental level
- Unclear whether this process exists or if it occurred during evolution.

#### Penrose's Quantum-Gravity Theory of Consciousness

**Penrose's Objective Reduction Theory**

**Background:**
- Penrose's solution to quantum mechanics' wave function collapse problem
- Problem: No apparent reason for collapse of wave functions in small-scale systems versus large-scale, classical systems

**Conventional Explanation:**
- Copenhagen interpretation: Measurement by conscious observer collapses wave function
- Criticism: Absurdity of cat thought experiment

**Objective Reduction (OR) Hypothesis:**
- Intermediate between quantum and macroscopic states, an objective factor disturbs superposition and causes collapse to classic states and locations

**Key Concepts:**
1. Gravity plays a role in OR at the Planck scale
2. Quantum superposition of mass causes underlying space-time separation and spontaneous self-collapse
3. Size of isolated system inversely related to coherence time according to uncertainty principle
4. Large systems (e.g., cat) collapse quickly, small ones take longer
5. Brain events occur within the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds
6. Quantum coherent superposition develops in MT subunit proteins (tubulins)
7. OR is "orchestrated" by tuning quantum oscillations and selecting noncomputable states
8. Each OR event selects a particular fundamental experience, like sensory perception or conscious choice
9. Quantum coherence may have emerged in eukaryotic MT assemblies via Fröhlich mechanism or be an intrinsic property of their structure and geometry
10. Evolution of actin gels and intercellular gap junction connections enabled larger quantum states among MT in many connected cells, leading to the emergence of consciousness.

#### Theorizing Consciousness Emergence from Microtubules in Early Cambrian Organisms

**Microtubule Arrays and Consciousness in Evolution**

**Microtubule Arrays:**
- Schematic representation of superradiance process in a microtubule (Jibu et al., 1994)
  * Initial state (a)
    * Energy gain from thermal fluctuations increases water molecules in first excited rotational energy state
  * Collective mode with long-range coherence inside the microtubule (b)
  * Coherent photons created collectively and lost in quantized electromagnetic field inside a microtubule (c)
  * Water molecules regain initial state (a)
- Actinosphaerium axonemes: tiny heliozoan with about 100 rigid, protruding axonemes containing several hundred interlinked MTs (Roth et al., 1970)
  * Each axoneme contains about 3 × 10^7 tubulins; entire heliozoan contains 3 × 10^9 tubulins
  * Observed disassembly in the presence of anesthetic halothane (Allison & Nunn, 1968)
- Prehensile tentacles in suctorians: provide locomotion and adaptive behaviors through coordinated MT slide movement (Hauser and Van Eys, 1976)
  * Each single tentacle contains about 10^9 tubulins

**Consciousness and Evolution:**
- Consciousness likely accelerated evolution due to biological complexity for emergence (hypothesis)
- Primitive consciousness may have emerged in early Cambrian worms, urchins, or suctorians around 540 million years ago
- Critical factors: MT, cilia, centrioles, and axonemes (Orch OR model of consciousness)
- Fossil records suggest that modern animal species arose during the Cambrian explosion.

## VII ANESTHESIOLOGY

**Anesthesiology: Overview**
* Millions undergo general anesthesia yearly for surgical procedures
* Discovered over 100 years ago, provides complete loss of consciousness and pain insensibility with reversible effects
* Delivered via airway to lungs, dissolve in blood, reach brain and organs
* Improvements lead to modern gases like isoflurane and sevoflurane, nitrous oxide
* Also use intravenous drugs: opioids for pain relief, benzodiazepines, sodium pentothal, propofol
* Aim for adequate anesthesia without consciousness, but cases of intraoperative awareness have occurred
* Causes include pilot error, equipment malfunction, reduced dosing or unknown causes
* Prevention of consciousness essential; amnestics used for sedation patients who are conscious
* Intraoperative awareness different from postoperative recall
* Anesthesiology provides insight into consciousness through anesthetic drugs and mechanisms.

**Anesthetic Mechanisms:**
* Various types: inert gas xenon, volatile gases, soluble barbiturates, alcohols, steroids
* Share common solubility in hydrophobic environment like olive oil (Meyer-Overton correlation)
* Anesthetics bind weakly in sensitive proteins' hydrophobic pockets
* Franks and Lieb: effects on lipid membranes inconsequential; proteins responsible for neural function
* Postsynaptic receptors: glutamate receptors resistant, GABA, glycine, serotonin, nicotinic acetylcholine sensitive
* Other less sensitive proteins: presynaptic channels, cytoskeletal proteins.

**Anesthetic Effects on Specific Receptors:**
* Postsynaptic receptors: mainly axonal presynaptic ion channels or postsynaptic receptor-gated channels
* Glutamate receptors (exciting neurotransmitter in mammalian brain) resistant to gaseous anesthetics but affected by intravenous drugs like ketamine and PCP
* NMDA receptors (important for consciousness, interact with ion channels, other receptors, biomolecules, second-messenger factors, cytoskeletal factors).

**Unsolved Questions:**
* Mechanism of anesthetic effect unknown; related to nature of consciousness?
* Identifying key sites for consciousness through critically affected neural proteins.

### 38 The Molecular Basis of General Anesthesia: Current Ideas Nicholas P. Franks and William R. Lieb

**General Anesthetics: Understanding Their Effects and Mechanisms (Franks and Lieb, 2021)**

**Background:**
- General anesthetics are diverse chemicals capable of inducing loss of consciousness and producing various effects.
- Two main measures for assessing anesthetic depth: minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and MAC awake.
- MAC is the concentration required to prevent 50% of patients from moving in response to pain.
- MAC awake is the concentration needed for 50% of patients to fail to respond to a verbal command or painful stimulus.
- Anesthetics are not "magic bullets" but affect numerous functions of the nervous system.

**Primary Sites of General Anesthetic Action:**
- Traditionally thought to act by dissolving in lipid regions of brain due to Meyer and Overton correlation.
- Clinical concentrations have little effect on lipid bilayer structure, suggesting an alternative target.
- Evidence points towards proteins as primary targets for general anesthetics:
  - Firefly luciferase, a purified enzyme without lipids, can bind and be inhibited by various anesthetic agents at concentrations identical to those causing general anesthesia.

**Theories on General Anesthetic Mechanisms:**
- Early theory: Anesthetics perturb lipid bilayer structure leading to altered protein functioning.
- Later findings suggest direct binding to proteins as the primary mechanism.

#### General Anesthetics Act by Binding to Proteins: Effects on Ion Channels

**General Anesthetics and Proteins: Evidence for Direct Interactions**
- Observations by Meyer and Overton explained quantitatively through anesthetics binding to proteins (not lipids)
- Negative results regarding lipids supported view that most effects caused by general anesthetics are due to protein interactions
- Optical isomers (enantiomers) of inhalational agents, like isoflurane, provide strong evidence for direct protein binding:
  - R(-) isomer has a 50% greater EC50 concentration than S(+) isomer
  - No differential partitioning between lipid bilayers and water, suggesting stereoselectivity reflects chiral binding to proteins

**General Anesthetics and Ion Channels: Voltage-Gated Channels**
- Axonal conduction more refractory than synaptic transmission
- Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels insensitive to inhibition by general anesthetics
  - Recombinant rat brain Na+ channel alpha subunits sensitive under depolarized conditions but not under resting conditions
- Voltage-gated Ca++ channels most sensitive among voltage-gated channels, plausible presynaptic targets
  - Small inhibitions (~10%) found for P-type channel in rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons at clinical concentrations of general anesthetics
  - Other voltage-gated Ca++ channel subtypes show similar small degrees of inhibition

**General Anesthetics and Ion Channels: Neurotransmitter-Gated Channels**
- Principal excitatory neurotransmitter in mammalian central nervous system is glutamate, but insensitive to most general anesthetics except ketamine and barbiturates
- Exceptionally sensitive superfamily of neurotransmitter-gated receptor channels: GABA, glycine, serotonin 5-HT3, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
  - Subunits share homologous amino acid sequences within and between receptor types
- In mammals, general anesthetics potentiate activities of GABA and glycine receptor channels, inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channels, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and reduced excitability.

#### General Anesthetics and Neurotransmitter Receptor Channels Interaction

**Anesthetic Binding Sites and Microtubules:**
- Neurotransmitter-gated receptor channels, such as GABAA, glycine, 5-HT3, and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine channels, are more sensitive to general anesthetics than voltage-gated ion channels.
- General anesthetics may affect microtubules indirectly through modulation of receptor channel activities (GABAA and glycine).

**Anesthetic Potentiation:**
- Anesthetics enhance binding affinity or change gating properties at neurotransmitter-activating sites.
- This results in prolonged neurotransmitter binding and increased channel activity during high neurotransmitter concentrations.

**Microtubules and General Anesthetics:**
- Early hypothesis suggested that anesthetics may reverseibly depolymerize neuronal microtubules, but evidence is limited to protozoan axopods at high aqueous concentrations.
- Recent reports indicate GABAA and glycine receptor channels are modulated by agents affecting microtubule polymerization.
- The relationship between microtubules and general anesthesia remains unclear, but cannot be ruled out as a subsidiary role.

**Anesthetic Binding Sites:**
- General anesthetics bind to small pockets or clefts on proteins, not extended surfaces.
- Size dependence for n-alcohols and tadpoles suggests cutoff point at dodecanol (molluscan neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor), undecanol (rat GABAA receptor channel), and tridecanol (mouse 5-HT3 receptor channel).
- The binding pocket size is roughly equal to the molar volume of decanol (approximately 200 cm3/mol).
- An important question remains open: What makes a binding site sensitive to general anesthetics?

#### Molecular Mechanisms of General Anesthesia

**General Anesthesia and Target Sites**
- **Identifying Target Sites**: Criteria for assessing relevance include:
  - **Sensitivity to anesthetics**: Site affected by surgical levels of general anesthetic is likely involved in either general anesthesia or side effects.
  - **Enantiomeric potency ratios**: Identical for some receptors (nicotinic acetylcholine, GABAA) and different for others (volatile anesthetics).
  - **Exceptions to Meyer-Overton rule**: Halogenated compounds not anesthetic at expected concentrations may be identified and tested on potential targets.
- **Neurotransmitter-Gated Ion Channels**: Likely neuronal proteins involved in general anesthesia, with exceptions (ATP-gated channel).
  - Block excitatory synaptic channels
  - Potentiate activity of inhibitory synaptic channels
- **Loss of Consciousness**: Unknown mechanism at anatomical level, but progress made at molecular level.
- **Future Research**: Functional brain imaging and careful selection of anesthetic agents may provide insights into consciousness.

### 39 On the Mechanism of Action of Anesthetic Agents Hans Flohr

**The Mechanism of Action of Anesthetic Agents**

**Dissociative Anesthetics**:
- Act as noncompetitive antagonists of the NMDA receptor
- Bind to a recognition site within the receptor-operated cation channel and block the influx of Na+ and Ca++ ions into neurons
- Antagonize glutamate-evoked excitation and the induction of activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy, which are triggered by Ca++
- Cause severe disturbances of consciousness
- In low doses: Induce altered states of consciousness with sensory illusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, distortions of body image, and disorganized thought
- In high doses: Produce general anesthesia

**Anesthetic State Produced by Noncompetitive NMDA Antagonists**:
- Characterized by a selective loss of conscious functions in combination with relative maintenance of protective reflexes
- Patients are in a trance-like state and do not appear to be asleep, but seem "disconnected from the surroundings"
- Electroencephalographic studies attribute these features to a depression of neuronal activity in cortical association areas and a selective blockade of higher associative functions

**Noncompetitive NMDA Antagonists Interact with Other CNS Components**:
- Interact with opioid receptors, monoaminergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic transmitter systems
- However, these actions are not able to fully account for the drugs' anesthetic and psychotomimetic properties

**Possible Explanation of Anesthetic and Psychoactive Effects**:
- Believed to be caused by their NMDA antagonism
- Reasons:
  - All substances that bind within the NMDA receptor-associated channel produce a similar anesthetic state
  - The anesthetic potency of these compounds is highly correlated with their relative affinity for the binding site within the channel
  - The anesthetic effects can be modified by changing their binding kinetics
  - Agonists of glufamate and glycine receptors increase the opening time of the NMDA receptor channel, enhancing the dissociation of ligands bound within it
  - Selective glutamate and glycine antagonists reverse the antianesthetic effect of glutamate and glycine

**NMDA Synapse as a Target for Other Drugs**:
- **Glutamate Receptor**: Can be blocked by specific competitive NMDA antagonists
- **Glycine Binding Site**: Coactivation is necessary for receptor activation, can be blocked by glycine antagonists
- **Polyamine Binding Site**: Can be blocked by polyamine antagonists
- **Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS)**: Can be inactivated by various NOS inhibitors
- **Presynaptic Transmitter Release**: Can be inhibited pharmacologically, e.g., by riluzole

**Possible Indirect Interventions that Block the NMDA Receptor Complex**:
- Altering the postsynaptic membrane potential can modulate the functioning of the receptor channel complex
- Inhibitory or excitatory synapses located in the vicinity of the NMDA receptor complex can modify the working conditions of the NMDA receptor channel complex

#### NMDA Receptor's Role in Consciousness and Anesthesia

**Anesthetic Properties and NMDA Receptor Interaction**

**NMDA Synapse as a Target for Anesthetics**:
- Classic gas anesthetics may interact with NMDA receptor, contributing to their anesthetic effects
- Drugs affecting glutamate release (e.g., riluzole) or NO production/action can also have anesthetic properties

**Role of NO in Anesthesia**:
- NOS inhibition can decrease MAC of halothane and prolong sleeping time
- Brain-specific NOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole can reverse these effects by L-arginine
- Dzoljic et al. (1996) found similar results with L-NMMA
- Evidence suggests that halothane and other anesthetics can interact with NO production/action

**GABA Receptors and Anesthetic Mechanism**:
- Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, steroids, etomidate, and propofol primarily act via GABAA receptor
- GABA receptors are located near NMDA receptors, affecting their working conditions
- AMPA antagonist NBQX possesses anesthetic properties by modulating NMDA receptor's contribution to synaptic transmission

**NMDA Receptor-Dependent Plasticity and Mental Representations**:
- NMDA receptor not required for fast, normal synaptic transmission
- Activation of NMDA receptor facilitates positive feedback and triggers plastic processes that strengthen connections within an assembly
- This process can lead to the formation of engrams and short-lived assemblies, essential for cognitive processes

**Higher-Order Representational States**:
- NMDA synapse plays a critical role in generating higher-order representational structures
- Anesthetized brains may differ from conscious brains due to their ability to produce these complex representations

**Metarepresentations and Phenomenal Consciousness**:
- Consciousness arises from the brain's representational activity
- Higher-order representation theories propose that consciousness is a metarepresentation or higher-order thought
- Support for this concept comes from physiological arguments (e.g., NMDA receptor's role in producing higher-order representations)

## VIII SLEEP, DREAMING, AND NONCONSCIOUS PROCESSES

**Part VIII: Sleep, Dreaming, and Nonconscious Processes**

**Overview:**

### 40 The Conscious State Paradigm: A Neuropsychological Analysis of Waking, Sleeping, and Dreaming J. Allan Hobson

**Conscious State Paradigm: A Neuropsychological Analysis of Waking, Sleeping, and Dreaming**

**Background:**
- Philosophical and experimental approaches have failed to define or explain human consciousness
- Renewed interest in the problem inspired by cognitive and brain sciences growth
- Transition from wakefulness to dreaming has dramatic changes in mind and brain states affecting consciousness components

**Components of Consciousness:**
1. **Perception**: Representation of input data
2. **Memory**: Retrieval of stored representations
3. **Attention**: Selection of input data
4. **Cognition**: Reflection on representations, logical thought
5. **Language**: Narrative linguistic symbolization of representations
6. **Emotion**: Feelings about representations
7. **Instinct**: Innate propensities to act
8. **Volition**: Decisions to act
9. **Action**: Representation of goals, intentional behavior
10. **Integration**: Synchronizing brain modules for unified awareness

**Brain-Mind State Dependency:**
- Consciousness varies with changes in brain state during the day and night
- Brain-mind is a unified system, studying state dependency may lead to a realistic theory of consciousness

**Conscious States:**
1. **Waking**: Integrated awareness of the world, body, and self; consistent processing conditions for all components
2. **NREM Sleep**: Offline from inputs/outputs, self-activates with vivid internally generated percepts, illogical cognition
3. **REM Sleep**: Characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorientation, emotional intensifications

**Comparison Across Species:**
- Conscious states differentiate diurnally and phylogenetically
- REM sleep is a modern invention in highly evolved brains with large cortices
- Sleep plays an active role in cortical function development
- Different levels or kinds of consciousness arise in brains according to level of complexity.

#### Historical Background Philosophical speculation regarding the nature of consciousness is as old as recorded history, and many materialist philosophers...

**Historical Background and Discoveries in Consciousness and Sleep**

**Modern Scientific Era**:
- Discovery of electrical nature of nervous activity (1928) by Adolf Berger
- EEG demonstrated brain origin, not artifacts
- State-dependent nature of EEG showed rhythmic oscillations during relaxation and arousal

**Reticular Activating System Concept**:
- Discovered by Giuseppe Moruzzi and Horace Magoun (1949)
- Nonspecific system operating in parallel with ascending sensory pathways
- Allowed translation of afferent stimuli into central activation and opened door to autoactivation

**Discovery of REM Sleep**:
- Spontaneous autoactivation observed by Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman (1953)
- EEG desynchronization with rapid eye movements (REMs), heart rate accelerations, and dreaming
- Cycle of NREM sleep and REM sleep recurred every 90 to 100 minutes

**40 Hz Activity in Consciousness**:
- Proposed solution for "binding problem" by synchronizing distant brain units
- Llinas emphasized importance of intrinsic neuronal oscillations in all states of consciousness

**Input-Output Gating in REM Sleep**:
- Muscle inhibition a regular component of REM sleep (Jouvet, 1962)
- Pontine brain stem localized control system for REM sleep and PGO waves
- Synchronous with phasic activation signals (PGO waves), triggered geniculate and cortical neuron bursts

**Differences Between Waking and Dreaming**:
- Sensory input blocked by presynaptic inhibition
- Perception (external) diminished due to blockade of sensory input
- Enhanced disinhibition of networks storing sensory representations for memory storage
- Attention lost, decreased aminergic modulation causes failure of sequencing and rule inconstancy
- Self-reflection weakened by failures of attention, logic, and memory
- Emotion episodically strong with cholinergic hyperstimulation of amygdala and limbic forebrain
- Volition weak due to top-down motor control and frontal executive power outcompeted by disinhibited subcortical networks.

#### Neurochemical Modulation of Consciousness in Sleep

**Neurobiological Model**
- Reciprocal interaction between aminergic and cholinergic systems
- Waking state: tonic aminergic and phasic aminergic-cholinergic modulation, leading to electrical activation and open input-output gates
- REM sleep: tonic aminergic demodulation and phasic cholinergic modulation, resulting in closed input-output gates, intense phasic autostimulation, and presynaptic inhibition that blocks external sensory signals

**Neuropsychological Model**
- Progressive loss of responsiveness to the external world with cortical deactivation during sleep onset and deeper NREM sleep
- REM sleep: brain reactivates but endogenous signals (PGO waves) from the brain stem replace external stimuli as inputs, leading to intense visual hallucinations and dream emotions (e.g., anxiety, surprise), potentially driven by cholinergic amygdala activation.

#### Neuropsychological Model Explains Conscious State Changes During Sleep

**Cognition and Sleep States:**
- Cognitive states shift from wakefulness to NREM sleep (non-progressive ruminations) and then REM sleep (disoriented, illogical cognition) during sleep cycle
- Brain in REM sleep is aminergically demodulated, contributing to failures of attention, orientation, memory, logic, and dream obscurity

**Activation-Input-Modulation (AIM) Model:**
- Three-dimensional state space model for conscious states
  - A: Activation
  - I: Input source & strength
  - M: Mode of processing
- Theoretically any point in state space is possible, but system normally constrained to a path from high wakefulness (A, I, M) to low REM sleep (A, I, M)
- Lucid dreaming as hybrid dissociated condition between wakefulness and REM with potential for controlled behaviors and insight
  *Occurrence: Spontaneously in late childhood or early adolescence*
  *Cultivation: Presleep autosuggestion*

**Predictions:**
- Lucid dreaming situated on the right sidewall of AIM state space between REM and wakefulness
- Frontal cortex relatively inactivated in non-lucid REM dreams with high pontine cholinergic PGO system activity
- In lucid dreaming, frontal cortex activated and pontine PGO system suppressed
- Testable predictions using imaging techniques like PET, SPECT, MRI
- Lucid state unstable due to top-down messages from the frontal cortex that suppress cholinergic system and turn on aminergic system causing awakening.

### 41 Dream Sleep and Waking Reality: A Dynamical View Allan Combs and Stanley Krippner

**Dreams vs. Waking Reality: A Dynamical View**

**Characteristics of Dreams:**
- Fluid images, thoughts, and feelings
- Elastic progression of events
- Shrouded in joy or grief (occasionally epiphany)
- Processual nature

**Process Perspectives:**
- Old and widespread thinking
- William James' "stream of thought" concept
- Systems theory perspective
  - Complex interactions of small processes
  - Forms hierarchically larger process structures
  - Autopoietic systems (self-creating)

**Consciousness as an Autopoietic Event:**
- Psychological processes weave together
- Arises from mental activity and physiological states
- Subject to continuous flux
- Unique pattern defining individual personality
- Chaotic attractor in systems theory

**Chaos Theory Applications:**
- Weather pattern example
- Moods, thoughts, memories follow a chaotic course
- Brain itself is chaotic system (speculative)

**States of Mind-Body and Consciousness:**
- Complex chaotic systems support each other
- Feelings, thoughts, memories unite into patterns
- Support overall fabric of the system
- Temporary depression as an example
  - Accompanied by physical changes and behaviors
- States of mind-body create larger holistic structures, states of consciousness.

#### Dream Consciousness: Chaotic Processes Yielding Creative States

**Three-Tiered Consciousness Structure**

**Basic Process Elements (Psychological Functions)**: Self-organize into states of mind-body

**States of Mind-Body**: Supported by particular states of consciousness

**Ordinary Waking Consciousness**:
- Direct interaction with consensual world
- Structured by sensory input and interoceptive stimulation
- Behavioral output shapes processes of consciousness
- Calibrates itself to the consensual environment
- Builds up a sense of self
- Cognitive processes provide understanding of events in the material and social environment
- Tendency to organize information about life events in terms of stories

**Dream Consciousness**:
- Disconnected from external world
- Freed from powerful patterning forces of consensual reality
- Relaxes into comfortable patterns of activity
- Sensory input inhibited during REM sleep
- Shift from aminergic to cholinergic dominance
- Large electrical PGO waves originate in pontine reticular formation
- Allows the mind to flow along subtle channels of yearning, desire, obsession, etc.
- Dreams can contain a wealth of new and creative configurations, including stories
- Brain activity during REM sleep is not specific to dreaming
- Dreaming mind able to acquire attractor basins of various states of consciousness

**Goertzel's Theory**:
- Dreaming brain relaxes into optimal or most "comfortable" configurations
- PGO bombardment increases noise level in cortex, disrupting waking associations and allowing creative psychological processes

### 42 Dreaming and Consciousness Stephen LaBerge

**Understanding Dreaming and Consciousness**

**Dreaming as a Conscious Process**:
- Often considered an unconscious mental process
- However, dreams are conscious experiences
- The purest instances of consciousness experienced daily
- Dreams result from the brain using internal information to create a simulation of the world

**Brain's Role in Creating World Model**:
- Brain models the world based on current sensory information and past experience
- In sleep, primary sources of information are past experience and current state of organism (memories, expectations, fears, desires)
- Dreaming results from the brain using internal information to create a simulation of the world without external sensory input

**Connection between Perception and Dreaming**:
- Understanding dreaming is central to understanding consciousness
- Theories of consciousness that do not account for dreaming are incomplete
- Theories contradicted by phenomenological and psychophysiological studies on dreaming must be incorrect

**Factors Influencing Perception**:
- **Expectations**: Sensory information is often ambiguous, perception depends on expectations (context, past, recent experience, familiarity, emotional states, personality)
- **Motivations**: Perception influenced by various levels of motivation, from basic drives to psychological needs and higher motives

**Role of Schemas in Perception**:
- Brain uses matching process to identify what is perceived based on existing mental models or schemas
- Schemas capture essential regularities about the world, help organize experience, and constitute our private theory of reality

#### Comparing Waking and Dream Experiences: Similarities and Differences

**Dreams vs Waking Perception:**

**Expectation and Motivation in Dreams:**
- Influenced by past experiences, personal interests, preoccupations, and concerns (Globus 1987)
- Not limited to patchwork of past experiences (Freud's theory questioned)
- Wish fulfillment dreams common due to motivation and emotions
- Fear can also influence dreams, leading to unpleasant sequences
- Schema activation accounts for complexity and meaningfulness in dreams

**Schema Activation:**
- Story schemas generate significant detail and coherent plots
- Reifying unconscious mind as "dream director" unnecessary
- Interpreting dreams revealing of personality

**Similarities Between Dreaming and Waking Perception:**
- Expectations and assumptions shape experiences (LaBerge, Kahan, and Levitan 1995)
- Equivalent measurements required for fair comparison

**Differences in Dreaming and Waking Perception:**
- Qualitative distinction often assumed but not equally evaluated
- Lack of reflection and intentional control in dreams commonly believed (Rechtschaffen 1978)
- Recent study challenges this view through equivalent sampling methods.

#### Lucid Dreaming: Bridging Consciousness and Physiology during REM Sleep.

**Experiences During REM Sleep**
- **Lucid dreams**: rare exceptions where we become conscious that we are dreaming
- Characterized by: free recall of waking life, clear thinking, deliberate action in dream world
- Historically met with skepticism due to perceived paradox of conscious sleep
- Verified through eye movement signals during REM sleep (eye movements correspond to gaze shifts reported in lucid dreams)

**Studying Consciousness Through Lucid Dreaming**
- Subjective reports of private mental events are difficult to verify objectively
- Two strategies to increase reliability: highly trained subjects and psychophysiological approach
- Studies on dreamed experiences showed physiological effects similar to those during corresponding waking activities
- Dreams last approximately the same length as objective time (as verified through eye movement signals)
- Rapid breathing, holding breath, singing, counting, and sexual activity in dreams produce physiological changes resembling their waking counterparts
- Shifts in lateralized electroencephalographic activity during singing and counting in dreams are similar to those during actual activities
- Pilot study on dreaming sexual arousal and orgasm revealed patterns of physiological activity closely matching waking experiences.

### 43 Representational Momentum and Other Displacements in Memory as Evidence for Nonconscious Knowledge of Physical Principles Timothy L. Hubbard

**Representational Momentum and Other Displacements in Memory as Evidence for Nonconscious Knowledge of Physical Principles**

**Remembered Position Displacements**:
- Remembered position of a horizontally moving target is often displaced:
  - Forward in the direction of motion
  - Faster target velocities produce larger displacments
- This pattern reflects the operation of invariant physical principles, as if the mental model of the external world is subject to the same forces

**Representational Momentum**:
- Refers to the displacement forward of remembered position
- Suggested to result from internalization of the principle of physical momentum by the representational system
- More recently, attributed to spatiotemporal coherence between represented and representing worlds
- Or reflecting internalization of environmentally invariant physical principles into the representational system

**Representational Gravity**:
- Memory for horizontally moving targets is also displaced downward below the axis of motion
- Larger forward displacements for descending motion, and downward displacments for horizontally moving targets, are consistent with gravity's effects on a moving object
- Demonstrates internalization of mass effects into the representational system

**Representational Friction**:
- Decreased forward displacement when targets slide across or compress multiple surfaces
- Indicates the existence of representational friction, which parallels the effect of physical friction on momentum
- Demonstrates the robustness of representational friction in the absence of changes to actual velocity

**Representational Centripetal Force**:
- Memory for a target moving along a circular orbit is displaced forward and inward
- Magnitude of displacement increases with angular velocity and radius length
- Consistent with internalization of the principles of centripetal acceleration and tangential velocity in the representational system

#### Environmental Invariants Hypothesis: Mental Representations Reflect Physical Principles

**Environmental Invariants Hypothesis**
- Our representational system responds as if mental representations are subject to same physical principles as physical objects
- Incorporates environmentally invariant physical principles into the representational system (Hubbard 1995b)
- Second-order isomorphism between mental and physical realms
- Previous theories don't go far enough: Gibson, Shepard, Freyd, etc.
- Memory for spatial position extrapolated based on environmentally invariant principles

**Implications for Displacement in Spatial Memory**
- Human representational system shaped to incorporate environmentally invariant physical principles
- Extrapolation of spatial position could offer selective advantage
- Representation doesn't portray world as it is right now, but rather an extrapolated world-as-it-soon-will-be

**Naive Physics and Environmental Invariants Hypothesis**
- Untutored observers may predict incorrect paths of objects based on environmentally invariant principles
- Interpreted as lack of veridical physical knowledge by McCloskey and Kohl (1983)
- Hubbard (1996): Incorrect trajectories could reflect interaction between representational momentum and diminishing representational centripetal force

**Implications for the Study of Consciousness**
- Automatic nonconscious processes produce displacement in spatial representation
- Displacement results from interaction between conscious expectations and environmentally invariant physical principles
- Conscious processing interferes with extrapolation process, making it less adaptive
- Consciousness may compensate for errors produced by nonconscious extrapolation when a stimulus does not behave as expected
- Priming representational pathways based on explicit knowledge to improve displacement accuracy.

### 44 Emotion and Consciousness: A Shotgun Marriage? Daniel S. Levine

**Emotion and Consciousness: A Shotgun Marriage?**

**Are Emotions Consciously Felt?**
- Recall an aesthetic experience that was intensely pleasurable
- During the experience, you may have consciously acknowledged enjoying it for a certain period
- However, when recalling the experience, you do not distinguish between the enjoyed and non-enjoyed parts
- Suggests a one-to-one relationship between emotions and conscious states does not exist
- **Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux**: Emotions can be thought of as computational processes controlled by evolutionarily old brain systems for survival.
- Emotional experiences involve both conscious and unconscious components

**Unconscious Biases in Emotions**
- Consciously felt emotions do not always reflect all the ways they influence behavior
- Examples:
  - **Doeringer and Piore**: Unconscious racial biases in hiring decisions
  - **Lakoff and Johnson**: Unconscious metaphors in language (e.g., argument is war) influencing behavior
- Tversky and Kahneman's heuristics for decision making: Representativeness, availability, and weighting of attributes

**Neural Systems for Generating and Selecting Alternatives**
- Previous network models focused on passive evaluation of known alternatives
- Need to include active exploration of the environment (e.g., Verbal Fluency Test)
- Guided by task requirements or internal priority-setting, which is influenced by the hippocampus and dorsolateral frontal cortex.

#### Neural Network Model for Decision Making and Self-Actualization

**Pribram's Suggestions on Dorsal Far Frontal System and Hippocampus Function (1991)**
- Controls ordering of priorities for effective action
- Damage to frontal region prevents shifting attentional biases
- Neural network models suggest episodic gating or filtering of stored representations
  - Modulation of connections from hippocampus to association cortex
- Role in consciousness through thalamus connections discussed in Taylor (1992)

**Emotional Biases and the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**
- Amygdala monitors emotional values of sensory events
- Orbital region of PFC has strong reciprocal connections with amygdala
- Damage to orbital cortex prevents usual emotional reactions and distorts decision making

**Role of Prefrontal Cortex in Generating Alternatives and Limiting Choices (Damasio, 1994)**
- Dorsolateral PFC generates alternative courses of action through hippocampal connections
- Orbitomedial PFC limits choices based on emotional factors
- Patients with damage to orbitofrontal cortex endlessly develop alternatives and cannot decide

**Self-Actualization and Optimization (Levine, 1994)**
- Competitive network representing "needs" has a Lyapunov function, V
- Optimal state is global minimum of V
- Negative affect signal from amygdala detects nonoptimality and compares to imagined alternatives
- Self-actualization network allows tremendous variation in approach to optimal or suboptimal actions

**Decision Styles (Leven, 1987)**
- Dantzig solvers: Repeatable method to achieve solution
- Bayesian solvers: Maximize measurable criterion through probability calculations
- Godelians: Innovative solutions using intuition and reason
- Interaction between personal style and unfamiliar tasks can lead to unintended consequences.

## IX LANGUAGE, ANIMALS, AND CONSCIOUSNESS

**Animal Language, Animals, and Consciousness**

**Overview:**
- Descartes' denial of animal consciousness based on lack of speech
- Malcolm argued against this, suggesting continuity in consciousness but discontinuity in thought
- Griffin challenged the idea that animals are "thoughtless brutes"
- Animal language projects aimed to understand animal cognition and awareness through teaching sign languages

**Animal Language Projects:**
1. **First attempts at vocal communication**: Failures due to lack of adequate vocal equipment or cognitive capacity
2. **Sign language with chimpanzees**: Washoe's mastery of American Sign Language (ASL)
- Gardners trained Washoe on simplified ASL, claiming over 130 signs and syntactic order
- Fouts continued studies and reported signing between chimps and humans
3. **Other sign language projects**: Nim Chimpsky, gorillas, orangutans, and other approaches like chip systems or computer keyboards
4. **Dolphins and sea lions**: Use of whistles or gestures to explore their capacity for understanding combinations of symbols

**Significance:**
These projects aimed to provide insight into the mental states and beliefs of animals, which is difficult to achieve otherwise. Despite limitations and criticisms, these studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of animal cognition and consciousness.

#### Animal Language Research: Debates, Methodologies, and Achievements

**The Ventures with Marine Mammals:**
- Emphasizes receptivity to signaled commands, not production of symbolic communication

**Two-Way Vocal Communication with an African Gray Parrot (Psittacus erithacus):**
- Work by Irene Pepperberg since 1977 on training parrot Alex to answer questions using English words
- Media coverage created great public interest, leading to skepticism and criticism of earlier ape language work

**Criticisms and Skepticism:**
- Concerns about conventional learning paradigms being sufficient to explain the performances
- Observations that signs used by apes approximated human sign language tenuously
- Revelation by Herbert Terrace that chimpanzee Nim's signing was haphazardly repeated and cued on trainer's behavior, leading to accusations of "Clever Hans" phenomenon

**Testing Procedures and Revisions:**
- More careful designs in testing procedures and counter arguments against the possibility of subtle signs giving away answers
- Recognition that cueing is a legitimate training technique, especially in children's language acquisition

**Savage-Rumbaugh's Work with Pigmy Chimpanzee Kanzi:**
- Use of spoken English words and lexigrams through portable keyboard and computer screen for communication
- Strict double-blind procedures followed during testing, without food rewards or consequences
- Comparison of Kanzi's performance to children at age 18-30 months in understanding simple English

**Comparability with Human Performance:**
- Kanzi's ability to understand order information in various contexts and his quicker learning of lexigrams compared to spoken language, leading critics to acknowledge progress towards human comparability.

#### Comparing Animal Cognitive Capacities with Language and Consciousness

**Observations of Dolphins and Parrots**

**Dolphins:**
- Exhibit spontaneous mimicry of computer-generated simulations and non-species specific sounds
- Produce behaviorally appropriate responses in contexts
- Comprehend artificial gestural and acoustic signals
- Suggest capable of simple, two-way communication with people
- Reactions to mirrors and social play indicate conscious dimensions

**Parrots:**
- Learned English labels for colors, shapes, and materials
- Accurately identifies and requests objects up to six in a group
- Can categorize and count over 100 objects
- Makes accurate comparisons of color, shape, same-different, bigger-smaller
- Uses phrases for requests and responses
- If requests not responded appropriately, utters "Nah" and asks again
- Identifies uniquely defined objects by conjunction of color and shape
- Performances cannot be reduced to conventional operant learning or cueing effects

**Language and Consciousness:**
- Descartes believed thought requires language
- Paul Bloom disagrees but concedes language makes a difference
- Human mental life is richer than that of animals, indicating a role for language in novel concepts and categorizing reality
- Bloom argues against strong version of Whorf's thesis that all human concepts derive from language
- Language learning can occur without prior ideas or conscious beings, but some unique aspects of human mental life exist independently of language.

**Animal Awareness:**
- Attempts to use communication as a window into animal mentality have revealed cognitive capacities exclusive to humans, but not clear access to what it is like to be another creature.
- Cognitive ethology will need other ways to understand animal awareness beyond language, which may continue to be explored in the future.

### 46 Perspectives on Consciousness, Language, and Other Emergent Processes in Apes and Humans E. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Duane M. Rumbaugh

**Perspectives on Consciousness, Language, and Other Emergent Processes in Apes and Humans**

**Debates on Animal Mental Competencies**:
- Scholars have debated the mental competencies of animals relative to humans since antiquity
- Some held Animist views, believing in the immortality and transmigration of souls from animals to humans
- Others were Mechanists, asserting that neither animals nor humans are more than protoplasmic machines
- The Vitalists accepted the continuity between animals and humans but rejected the debates

**Descartes's View on the Mind and Body**:
- Descartes kept both the mechanist and animist position, distinguishing the mind and body of humans
- For Descartes, the human mind operated according to "rational thought" - a capacity denied to animals

**Darwin's Challenge to the Mechanist View**:
- Darwin challenged the accepted wisdom with his concept of evolution as a process shaped by numbers of offspring
- He was willing to attribute mind to animals and believed that many higher cognitive processes could be demonstrated in animals

**The Problem of Demonstrating Mind in Animals**:
- Attempts to show intent in animal behavior were difficult, as the "intent" behind a behavior remained hidden
- Lack of language was used as a criterion to determine whether an action was mechanistic or intentional

**Modern Neuroscience and the Concept of Mind Emergence**:
- Modern neuroscience relied heavily on experimental work with animals as human surrogates and brain-damaged human subjects
- The assumption is that "mind" emerges from matter in a predictable, understandable fashion

**The Centrality of Grammar and Language**:
- Linguists postulated the existence of a grammatical parser within the neural tissue to unlock language for humans
- The lack of this key renders the world unintelligible, limiting reasoning and understanding
- This view resurrects the human-animal dichotomy by positing an innate linguistic processor in humans

#### The Discovery of Linguistic Ability in Apes and Human-Animal Mind Debate

**Similarities Between Humans and Animals**
- Many animals share facial expressions, behaviors, and reactions with humans
- Humans perceive that some animals have a "psychological similarity" to themselves
- Similar sensory and perceptual capacities in animals
- Complex communication systems in animals are difficult to decipher
- Many animals build complex shelters and use tools

**Discovering Linguistic Capacity in Apes**
- Chimpanzee Washoe learned American Sign Language for the Deaf
- Washoe could express simple desires and needs using signs
- Controversy around Washoe's language abilities, with debate on whether it was "linguistic" or paired-associate learning
- Behaviorists argued that Washoe's signs were only a result of rewards received for signing
- Issue of intent in communication is difficult to observe and infer in animals

**Impact of Discovering Linguistic Capacity in Apes**
- Challenged the conceptual separation between humans and animals
- Raised questions about the nature of language, meaning, and mind in animals
- Debate on whether apes possess a "mind" or only respond to rewards

**Continued Debate on Animal Cognition**
- Researchers continue to explore animal cognition and language abilities
- Controversy around the use of terms like "language," "consciousness," and "intentionality" in discussing animal behavior
- Need for further research to understand the complexities of animal minds and their similarities with human minds.

#### Debate on Ape Language Focus: Understanding vs Syntax Competency

**Critics vs. Proponents of Ape Language**
- Critics argued that Washoe lacked intent to communicate
- Proponents believed in the existence of a grammar module and assumed it was real
- Debate focused on syntactical competency, ignoring understanding/listening abilities

**Washoe's Use of Language vs. Human Use**
- Washoe could ask for things but unable to give them on request
- Lacked listening or giving in response to specific requests
- Half of human language communication (comprehension) was missing

**Understanding the Importance of Comprehension**
- Language is a two-way street, humans confirm understandings through actions
- Comprehension required a "theory of mind" and the ability to separate speech stream into words/syllables

**Chimpanzee Communication: The Case of Sherman and Austin**
- Successfully communicated with humans due to their responses
- Attempts at inter-chimpanee communication revealed lack of comprehension and cooperation
- Instruction focused on fostering comprehension rather than production
- Language emerged from complex processes of exchange actions punctuated by speech

**Insights into the Nature of Language**
- Words not linked to things, but coordinated responses to others' speech
- Conditional reinforcement of comprehension impossible due to its silent nature.

#### Ape Language Development through Comprehension-Focused Training

**The Emergence of Language in Apes**

**Background:**
- Comprehension necessary for language use
- Critics pointed out that apes only expressed their own desires, not comprehending others' language
- Realization that comprehension is the key to language led to new methods of teaching language to apes

**Sherman and Austin**:
- Understood each other's symbol cosmology
- Effective communication monitored and corrected misunderstandings
- Limited exchanges focused on immediate needs
- Understood the power of symbols to convey information

**Additional Apes Acquiring Language**:
- No formal instruction, acquired through environment exposure
- Spoken language encouraged understanding of daily events
- Keyboard with lexigrams used for communication
- Comprehension of spoken words established
- Understanding includes past and future tenses, syntactical constructions
- Spontaneously learned to use lexigrams for desires

**Apes' Language Abilities**:
- Follow and participate in three-and four-way conversations
- Understand others' intentions, actions, and knowledge states
- Recognize the value of communication in altering perceptions
- Understanding requires complex capacities beyond a syntactical processor

**Panbanisha's Demonstration**:
- Understood that another agent's thoughts were not accurate reflections of reality
- Manipulated contents of others' minds by deceiving them
- Answered questions about what another party thought was in a box.

#### Language & Cognitive Abilities in Apes: Syntax, Naming, and Inference

**Understanding Others' Perceptions and Thoughts**

**Complexity in Understanding "What does A think?":**
- Questions about others' thoughts require advanced understanding
- Difference between observer's state of mind and that of the observed
- Syntactically similar to simple questions, but call for different answers based on experiences
- Cannot be taught through trial and error or syntactical explanations alone
- Reveals ape's language competence in understanding complex concepts

**Language and Consensus Interpretation:**
- Language leads to joint perception and interpretation of the world
- Coordinated actions become options based on shared understanding
- Windows into basic function, power, and value of language for apes and humans

**Names and Knowledge Building:**
- Naming carves the world into divisions for further investigation
- Encourages distinctions and similarities among things
- Abstract concepts can lead to deeper understanding, even if not directly observable

**Potential Language Skills in Animals:**
- Apes demonstrate complex language use
- Syntactic devices are not beyond their reach
- Possible existence of linguistic facets in natural communications

**Limitations and Future Research:**
- Assumptions about animal language should be reconsidered
- Complexities may exist beyond human encoding interests
- Evidence suggests bonobos use complex communication systems.

#### Exploring Animal Consciousness Through Communication with Apes

**Animal Language and Consciousness**

**Differences in Animal Perception:**
- Animals classify world differently than humans
- Humans: relationship between moon and tide
- Animals: sense relationship between insect movement and fruit ripening
- Overlooked that animals have other ways of communicating

**Importance of Studying Animal Consciousness:**
- Premise: animal consciousness is extant, similar to human consciousness
- Consciousness as emergent characteristic in many life forms
- Researcher cannot be detached observer due to ever-changing nature of consciousness

**Methods for Understanding Animal Consciousness:**
- Developing methods from studying human language acquisition by bonobos (Kanzi, Panbanisha)
- Central to achieving shared perspectives and constructions of presumed real world
- No final answers, but partial answers provide helpful steps towards understanding

**Funding and Acknowledgments:**
- Supported by grants from National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (HD-06016), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NAG2-438), and College of Arts and Sciences, Georgia State University
- Special appreciation to Mr. and Mrs. Steve Woodruff and Dr. Stephen Draper for their commitment to the future of Language Research Center.

### 47 Cognition and Communication in Dolphins: A Question of Consciousness Diana Reiss

**Cognition and Communication in Dolphins: A Question of Consciousness**

**Introduction:**
- Diana Reiss explores the question of dolphin consciousness through investigating their conscious awareness
- Definition of consciousness as a state of being aware of one's surroundings
- Numerous studies on sensation, perception, and kinesthetic awareness in dolphins

**Awareness vs. Consciousness:**
- Awareness involves self-reflection and knowledge of one's actions
- Distinction between "knowing how" to do something and "knowing that"
- Useful for cognitive ethologists in evaluating animal behavior

**Challenges in Determining Intentionality:**
- Difficulty in determining the mental states of other species
- Inferences about consciousness based on human subjective experiences and language use

**The Emergence of Cognitive Revolution:**
- Interest in attention, memory, language, problem solving, and concept formation
- Comparative neurophysiology shows basic neural mechanisms are similar in all mammals

**Evidence for Complexity and Versatility in Animal Communication:**
- Symbolic code comprehension and production in various species
- Tool use and semantic communication in natural systems of nonhuman animals
- Evidence for conceptual quantitative abilities in African grey parrots and chimpanzees

**Bottlenose Dolphins as Socially Complex Mammals:**
- Longitudinal studies indicate fission-fusion social structure with complex relationships
- Highly social mammals widely distributed throughout temperate and tropical waters

**Dolphin Cognitive Abilities:**
- Memory capacity and comprehension of artificial codes comparable to chimpanzees
- Rich vocal repertoire, including broadband, short duration clicks, wide-band pulsed sounds, and narrow-band whistles
- Strong evidence for vocal learning and mimicry in dolphins

**Experimental Study on Dolphin Vocal Mimicry:**
- Interactive underwater keyboard system to study functional and developmental aspects of dolphin vocal learning
- Spontaneous acquisition of new vocalizations and their use in behaviorally appropriate contexts provides evidence for perceptual awareness.

#### Dolphin Vocal Learning Through Keyboard Interaction

**Bottlenose Dolphin Study**

**Methodology**:
- Four captive bottlenose dolphins (two adult females, one-year-old male) presented with an underwater keyboard displaying visual forms to obtain specific items
- Use of specific keys resulted in a chain of events: computer-generated whistle followed by presentation of object or activity
- Dolphins were given free-choice system without explicit training procedures, allowing them to interact with the self-reinforcing system

**Observations**:
- Dolphins began vocal mimicry and production of facsimiles of computer-generated whistles after limited exposures
- Initial mimicry occurred within three successive trials for one young male dolphin, who reproduced different aspects of the "ball" whistle
- Dolphins tended to mimic and reproduce absolute frequency and temporal parameters of model sounds
- After first year: vocal mimicry was 19% higher than production
- In second year: no consistent relation between vocal mimicry and production, but more productions occurred compared to previous year

**New Combination Whistles**:
- Dolphins spontaneously produced a new combination whistle that could not have been acquired through vocal mimicry
- 28 different types recorded during second year, primarily in context of ball and ring play

**Contextual Use of Whistles**:
- Dolphins used whistle facsimiles appropriately:
  - Ball productions: 80% during ball play
  - Ring productions: 73% during ring play
  - Rub productions: 100% during physical rubbing
  - Novel ring-ball combination whistle: 82% during simultaneous ring and ball play

**Conclusion**:
- Provides evidence for vocal learning by this species, ability to acquire new vocal signals, associate them with objects/actions, and use in context without explicit training.

#### Dolphins Show Evidence of Conscious, Intentional Behavior

**Whistle Imitation in Dolphins:**
- In traditional studies, dolphins were selectively reinforced and shaped acoustic parameters for imitation (1000 exposures)
- Our study allowed dolphins to determine type, frequency, and parameters of signals they would imitate
- Results suggest more rapid and effective learning in a social environment
- Dolphins seemed to take an active role in the learning process with greater degrees of freedom

**Dolphin Behavior: Manipulative Play as Indicator of Consciousness:**
- Dolphins show manipulative abilities using mouths, pectoral fins, or tail flukes
- Anecdote about a dolphin retrieving brown paper pieces for food reward could be explained by other factors
- Clear evidence: Manipulative bubble ring production and play behavior
  - Anticipatory actions, awareness of contingencies past and future, and intense focus on stimuli
  - Evidence of intentionality and consciousness through volitional breathing, timing, and planning

**Conclusion:**
- Complexity and plasticity found in animal behavior and communication systems challenges previous assumptions
- More research needed with diverse species to clarify the nature of consciousness in nonhuman minds
- Marriage of laboratory studies and natural ecological evaluations essential for understanding other minds in nature.

### 48 Language and Mental Life Paul Bloom

**The Two Striking Facts About Human Mental Life**

**Human Mental Capabilities**:
- Humans have a rich mental life, able to consider abstract entities like arguments and plan for the future
- This goes beyond the limited thoughts of other primates, who have a "qualitatively poorer" mental life than humans

**The Role of Language in Human Cognition**

**Theories on the Origin of Human Mental Life**:
- One theory is that an enhanced general intelligence gave rise to all other cognitive capacities
- However, evidence suggests that language ability is not entirely derived from this general intelligence

**The Hypothesis: Language as a Driver for Human Cognitive Development**
- The hypothesis is that language evolved first for communication and then enabled the development of mental life
- This would simplify psychology by requiring only explaining the evolution of language, rather than multiple cognitive capacities

**Objections to the Whorfian Hypothesis**:
- Some argue that the mind can impose structure on the world without language
- However, evidence suggests that abstract concepts emerge after learning language for conscious apprehension

**Limitations of the Whorfian Hypothesis**:
- The strong version of the hypothesis, that all concepts arise from language, is false
- Abstract and diverse concepts exist independently of linguistic experience

#### Linguistic Frames of Reference Impact Spatial Cognition

**Fodor's Perspective on Language and Thought:**
- Nothing in natural language cannot be expressed in the language of thought (Fodor, 1975)
- Language can affect what concepts one can consciously entertain (attentional effect)
- Language can bring together preexisting concepts to create new ones (compositional effect)

**Whorfian Proposal:**
- Language may influence thought by affecting attention and combining old concepts into new ones
- Criticism: lack of cross-linguistic evidence, inaccurate linguistic claims, and refuted by some studies
- Recent research supports a limited Whorfian effect in spatial cognition
  * Languages differ in how they categorize space (Bowerman, 1996)
    **Example:** English vs. Finnish/Dutch/Spanish treatment of cup on table, handle on door, and apple in a bowl
  * Children acquire language-specific spatial categories early
  * Evidence for Whorfian effect if it affects nonlinguistic mental life outside language

**Levinson's Research:**
- Languages use different frames of reference (relative vs. absolute)
- Dutch speakers think about objects in close proximity using relative notions, while Tzeltal speakers use absolute ones
- Differences observed in nonlinguistic tasks requiring spatial inference and visual recall/gesture
- Not due to linguistic coding but rather dominant frames of reference in language (Levinson, 1996)

**Challenges:**
- Lack of evidence that these differences influence nonlinguistic mental life outside language.
- Possible third factor, such as differences in early spatial experience, could explain linguistic and cognitive differences between different cultures.

#### Language Influence on Cognitive Development and Mental Life: Evidence from Deaf Isolates and Word Learning Studies

**Effects of Language on Cognitive Processes**

**Levinson's Analysis**:
- Examines effects of linguistic differences between people raised in same physical and cultural environment
- Concludes that language, not culture, causes effects on cognitive processes (e.g., spatial thought)
- Critique: Systems of spatial thought exist independently of language in brain mechanisms underlying navigation for other species

**Attentional Effects of Language**:
- Language can affect "habitual thought and behavior" by drawing attention to certain ways of thinking about the world
- Example: Word learning motivates categorization by helping children attend to relevant concepts rather than spatial or thematic relationships

**Compositional Effects of Language**:
- Possibility that language creates new concepts by signaling new ways of combining old concepts
- Evidence: Perceptual learning in wine tasting; linguistic labeling can lead to formation of new categories and richer phenomenal experiences
- Inductive reasoning experiments show children generalize properties based on linguistic cues, suggesting language can drive concept formation

**Limitations**:
- Linguistic isolates (deaf adults without sign language) demonstrate abstract thought capabilities
- Young children are excellent learners of word meanings and possess a rich mental life before language acquisition
- Many abstract expressions can be fast mapped by young children in single contexts, challenging the idea that abstract concepts do not exist prior to language capability.

#### Infants' Mental Abilities Pre-Exist Language Development

**Infant Cognitive Abilities**:
- Infants can expect objects to continue existing after they go out of sight (Baillargeon 1987)
- Can predict trajectories of moving objects (Spelke 1994)
- Determine numerosities of small object arrays (Starkey, Spelke, and Gelman 1990)
- Perform simple additions and subtractions on object arrays (Wynn 1992)
- Can determine numerosities of distinct sounds (Starkey, Spelke, and Gelman 1990)
- Can individuate and enumerate distinct actions (Wynn 1996)
- Show ability to recall spatial locations (Wilcox, Rosser, and Nadel 1994)
- Make simple causal inferences (Leslie 1982)
- Predict agent's future actions based on behavior (Premack 1990)
- Infants have limitations, but can develop abstract concepts before language acquisition (Bloom 1996)

**Conclusion**:
- Linguistic cues do not fully explain human mental life richness
- Some unique aspects of human mental life exist independently of language
- Other explanations are needed to account for these aspects

## X EMERGENT AND HIERARCHICAL SYSTEMS

**Hierarchical Systems and Emergence**

**Academic Hazards**:
- Academics may confuse learned descriptions with reality
- This can lead to projection of confusions on others

**Signs of Being Conned**:
- Asking important questions about free will or the soul
- Watch for:
  - Quickly turning to complex formulas in Greek
  - Parroting outdated doctras discarded generations ago
  - Regurgitating what was learned as a graduate student

**Open vs. Closed Formulations**:
- **Open formulation**: Welcoming new facts and insights, open to the unknown
- **Closed formulation**: Confined within mended walls, closed to the new

**Science vs. Dogma**:
- Scientists aim to describe reality without fear or favor
- Claiming something does not exist because it's not in a set of assumptions is medieval dogma

**Open Formulation and Hierarchies**:
- **Hierarchical systems** are open by their nature
- The universe is constantly evolving, with new forms emerging at all levels
- Open hierarchical structures are tailored to represent emergent dynamics

**Taxonomy of Hierarchies**:
- Some higher levels are defined for convenience or because lower levels are insufficient
- There are constraints that arise from the nature of explanation
- The concept of "quarks, gluons, and weak forces" does not explain human interaction well

**Ontological Classifications**:
- Can distinctly different levels of description be assigned?
- Are there irreducible higher levels necessary for a full description of the universe?
- **Inflation**, as an example, does not exist at the quantum mechanics level

**Mathematical Framework for Emergence**:
- Ali and Zimmer present a mathematical framework to describe emergence in discrete space-time systems
- Organizational rules at one level play the role of states in an adjacent level
- This open system model allows for arbitrary initial conditions at each level

**Problems with Numerical Investigations**:
- There are many possible sets of discrete space-time systems, some so large they cannot be considered in full
- Computational difficulties can contribute to the problem of not knowing what these hierarchical models can do

### 49 The Five Kinds of Levels of Description Andrew Bailey

**The Five Kinds of Levels of Description**

**Levels of Description**:
- Not a monolithic phenomenon, hierarchies can vary significantly in function and reducibility/eliminability of higher levels.
- At least five distinct breeds:
  1. **Hierarchies of epistemological convenience**
  2. **Modeling hierarchies**
  3. **Explanatorily pragmatic hierarchies**
  4. Levels for reasons of **ontology** (not typically distinguished from the others)

**Hierarchies of Epistemological Convenience**:
- Higher levels used because it is cumbersome to give full descriptions at more fundamental levels
  - Reasons: convenience, impracticality, technological limitations
- Does not necessarily entail that only one fundamental description exists and higher levels are ontologically reducible

**Model Levels**:
- Application of a model to the phenomenon under consideration
- Explains/describes the phenomenon in a helpful way not available at lower level
- Reducibility of models to lower levels is complex

**Explanatory Pragmatics**:
- Most interesting and underrecognized type of epistemological levels
- Not a direct consequence of pragmatic descriptive limitations, but from the nature of explanation itself
  - Explanation involves understanding, which requires epistemic gaps to be filled by higher-level descriptions
  - Explanation is an asymmetric relation, not equivalent to logical or semantic relations
  - Not a transitive relation, meaning low-level descriptions may not provide relevant information for explanation

#### Explanatory Levels and Irreducibility in Science

**Levels of Explanation and Ontology**

**Explanatory Pragmatics vs Epistemological Convenience:**
- Explanatory pragmatics: Differences between levels of explanation may not be above or below each other, making it a moot point which is higher.
- Levels of epistemological convenience: Nesting hierarchy from more complex to less complex, with godlike beings unable to provide explanations at the bottom level for real phenomena.

**Group-Level Properties vs Levels of Being:**
- Group-level properties: Properties not found in components, require a higher level of description as mereological wholes.
  - Mereological levels are consistent with denying or indicating full describability at base level.
- Levels of being: Claiming something exists only at a higher level without lower but not reducible to it.
  - Two conditions: irreducibility and ineliminability for a full description of the universe.
  - Multiple realizability alone does not bring strong irreducibility; this requires no relevant similarity between token physical instantiations.
- Prima facie plausible but faces challenges regarding supervenience and maintaining uniqueness among tokens that instantiate patterns.

#### Discussion of Levels of Description and Inflation in Philosophy

**Key Conclusions from Discussion of Levels of Description:**
- **No unified notion of level of description exists:**
  * No agreed-upon definition or use of levels in this area
  - Can operate differently depending on context

- **Interesting non-ontological motivation for ineliminable levels:**
  * Explanation itself and its pragmatic virtues drive the need for different levels

- **Levels of being may consist of absence of correspondence:**
  * Between ontologically serious predicates at higher levels and identifiable patterns/regularities at lower ones

- **Assertion of corresponding levels less plausible than it seems:**
  * Complexity and nuances in concepts make clear correspondences uncertain.

### 50 Beyond Substance and Process: A New Framework for Emergence Syed Musfafa Ali and Robert M. Zimmer

**Conditions for Unbounded Emergence in Spatially Extended Finite Systems**

**Potential Conditions:**
- Infinite hierarchy of laws governing behavior is admitted
- Necessary for open or unbounded emergence

**Early Attempts at Understanding Emergence:**
- Ancient Greek maxim: "the whole is more than the sum of the parts"
- George Henry Lewes: Distinguished between resultants and emergents (1850s)
  - Resultants: Sequence of steps traceable
  - Emergence: Sequence not traceable, epistemological limitations
- C. Lloyd Morgan and J.C. Smuts further described emergence in the early 20th century
- First comprehensive explanatory framework by Samuel Alexander (1920)

**Emergent Theory of Mind (ETM)**
- Proponents: Searle, computational ETM (CETM)
- Two-level systemic hierarchy: Neuronal "firings" in the brain (lower/local) vs mental phenomena including consciousness (higher/emergent)
- Bottom-up causation provides necessary and sufficient conditions for emergence of consciousness
- Consistent with functionalism, supporting artificial consciousness

**Cellular Automata (CA)**
- D-dimensional lattice of K cells with finite states, rules, and neighborhoods
- Spatiotemporal dynamics give rise to new behaviors: matter, life, mind
- Downwards causation through feedback between global and local levels

**Problems with Emergence in CA:**
- Finite lattices, states, and rules have finite basin-of-attraction fields (Cariani, 1991)
  * Indicates incomplete knowledge, no further emergence once mapped
- Infinite lattice CAs can support unbounded potential for emergence
  * Consistent with idea of closed universe but inconsistent with current cosmological views

**Metarule Cellular Automata:**
- Introduce openness by postulating a hierarchy of CA rules at each level p > 0
- Rules are states at level p+1, initial conditions independently specifiable
- More metarule configurations as the number of levels increase
  * Empirical investigations have been restricted due to large configuration spaces.

#### Cellular Automata and Hierarchy for Universal Computation and Mind.

**Cellular Automata (CA)**
- **Elementary CA**: I-D CA with a neighborhood of three cells support behavior only in classes I, II, and II
- Potential to generate class IV behavior "at the edge of chaos" using metarule schemes
  - Preliminary results indicate incorporating a single level of metarules may allow generation of class IV behavior
- **Metarule CA**: Space-time evolution shown in Figure 50.3 (page 629)
- Other examples: Rule 906663673 generates class IV behavior, space-time evolution shown in Figure 50.4 (page 630)

**Beyond Substance and Process**
- Dualistic ontology at the lowest level (states and rules) vs monistic ontology at higher levels (rules and metarules)
- Proposed solution: bidirectionally infinite hierarchy where states at level m become rules at level m-1, and vice versa

**Epistemological Result**
- Observation "cuts" the hierarchy to determine global physics (zm) and local atomic substrate (zm-w)
  - Emergence and types of phenomena depend on the position of the cut
- Idea of "cutting" the world anticipated in earlier work by Spencer-Brown (1969)
- Problem remains regarding the source or agency responsible for the cut

**Solution: Intentionalistic Self-Cutting Ontological Hierarchy**
- Allows downwards causation via higher principles imposed by an intentional observer (subjective component of the hierarchy)
- Boundary conditions are set in the selective act of cutting by an intentional observer.

## XI QUANTUM THEORY, SPACE-TIME, AND CONSCIOUSNESS

**Quantum Theory, Space-Time, and Consciousness**

**Overview**
- Discussing hierarchical level of consciousness dependency in brain
- Some argue for neural electrochemical activities or subneural levels
- Proposed connection to quantum level, fundamental Planck scale
- Critics dismiss idea as "minimization of mysteries" or "marriage of convenience"
- Insights from quantum theory and space-time may help understand consciousness

**Quantum Theory**
- Attempt to describe atomic-structure scale reality
- Isolated atomic/subatomic systems exist in quantum superposition
- Classical world vs. microscopic quantum systems
- Transition from possibility to concreteness: collapse or reduction of wave packet (Copenhagen interpretation)
- Controversy over collapse and its implications for dynamics of universe

**Proposed Advantages of Quantum Theory in Understanding Consciousness**
1. Unity, "oneness" for binding problem
2. Cannot be directly observed like consciousness
3. Reveals fundamental reality nature
4. Possible substrate for conscious experience
5. Relationship between consciousness and physical theories

**The Evolution of Consciousness (Henry Stapp)**
- Classical physics unable to deal with consciousness
- Quantum physics provides natural setting for conscious experience
- Three approaches to collapse problem: Manyworlds picture, pilot-wave theory, wavefunction collapse view
- Conscious events seen as special cases of wavepacket collapses

**Quantum Theory and Consciousness (Euan Squires)**
- Unique conscious results occur only in observer's brain
- Simplest explanation: many-minds view with defects
- One-mind interpretation: consciousness selects one experienced state among possibilities
- Implies nonlocal, universal consciousness.

**Quantum Processes in Brain (Friedrich Beck)**
- Discussing potential quantum processes relevant to consciousness in the brain.

#### Discussion on Quantum Theory's Role in Neural Function and Consciousness

**Microscopic Quantum States and Brain Dynamics:**
- **Coherent quantum states**: Robust against thermal fluctuations in warm, noisy brain
- **Time scales for quantum processes**: Fast (pico-seconds to femtoseconds), e.g., electron transfer or hydrogen bond breaking
- **Neural and synaptic processes**: Slow (milliseconds to nanoseconds)
- **Decoupling of quantum processes from neural dynamics**: Except in "quantum trigger" situations
- Example: **Neurotransmitter exocytosis** - probabilistic release of synaptic vesicles, potentially influenced by quantum indeterminacy

**Chalmers vs. Scott on Consciousness:**
- Chalmers (1996): Unanswered question about consciousness loss when neurons are replaced with silicon devices
  - Question: Can a silicon device be functionally equivalent to a neuron regarding consciousness?
- Euan Squires' contribution: Thought experiment on replacing neurons from the bottom up vs. Chalmers' replacement one by one
- Sadly, Euan Squires passed away in summer 1996.

### 51 The Evolution of Consciousness Henry P. Stapp

**The Evolution of Consciousness: The Role of Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics in Understanding Consciousness**

**Classical Mechanics:**
- Does not entail the existence of consciousness
- Principles do not provide a basis for deducing phenomenal experience
- Lacks logical proof for validity of assertions about experiential aspects of nature
- Phenomenal elements could be epiphenomenal and not affect dynamics (options 1, 2, or 3)

**Limitations of Classical Mechanics:**
- No logical entailment of feeling's existence
- Contradictory to the naturalistic notion that consciousness evolved for survival advantage
- Failing to describe empirically observed properties of physical systems (inaccurate)

**Quantum Mechanics and Its Solution:**
- Successor to classical mechanics with a mathematical description converting particles into nonlocalized elements in an information network or knowledge structure
- Founders solved the problem by taking experiences as foundational elements, making them central to building new science.

**Key Points:**
1. Classical mechanics does not provide logical proof for consciousness existence and validity of assertions about experiential aspects.
2. The limited understanding of nature in classical mechanics forced an epiphenomenal character on consciousness which contradicts naturalistic notions.
3. Quantum mechanics solved this problem by making experiences central to the new science, acknowledging their role instead of grafting them onto a physical theory with no natural place for them.
4. Experiences are now seen as classically describable and form the foundation of quantum mechanics.

#### Exploring Multiple Quantum Ontologies and Their Implications for Consciousness

**Quantum Theory and Ontologies**

**Copenhagen Interpretation**:
- Pragmatic system describing statistical correlations between experiences, not providing a description of nature itself

**Ontological Pictures in Quantum Theory**:
- **Everett's One-World/Many-Minds ontology**: Physical world corresponds to each branch generated by Schrödinger equation, consciousness associated with each branch is dynamically independent
- **Bohm's Pilot-Wave Ontology**: Wave function guides particles without collapse, consciousness interacts with the pilot wave
- **Orthodox Wave Function Collapse ontology**: Wave function collapses to one state when measured, consciousness observes this single outcome

**Key Component: Quantum State Vector**
- Represents various "particles" with multiple variables
- Evolves according to Schrödinger equation, leading to branching and divergence of wave function
- Each branch represents a different classically describable possibility

**The Problem of Conceptualizing Coexisting Branches**:
- Logical simplicity of Everett's interpretation is undermined by the need to introduce probabilities
- Introducing consciousness as a new ontological element leads to dualism, rather than monism
- One-mind variation of Everett's many-minds interpretation may be more parsimonious

#### Discussing the role of consciousness in quantum mechanics theories.

**The One-Mind Version Promotion by Euan Squires (1990)**
- Squires' model has been promoted as having a one-mind version
- This model is dualistic, with two ontological types: quantum state and classical world
  - The classical world is represented by a moving point in the 3N-dimensional space
  - Equations of motion for this point cause it to move into one branch or another based on quantum-statistical rules
  - This theory is logically complete without consciousness, but introducing consciousness would be "gratuitous"
  - The classical model is nonparsimonious, with a plethora of empty branches that evolve for all eternity

**The Many-Minds Interpretation by Everett**
- Similar to Squires' model in being nonparsimonious
- Each individual human being has a "plethora of minds" only one of which is needed to account for empirical facts
- This interpretation causes many physicists to turn away from it as being "unorthodox"

**The Most Parsimonious Theory: Bohr/Heisenberg/von Neumann/Wigner Wave-Function Collapse Model**
- Accepts key insights from the Copenhagen interpretation
  - Our experienced knowledge is an appropriate reality for physical theory
  - Transitions from potentiality to actuality are a basic component of nature
  - These transitions are associated with abrupt changes in the quantum state of the universe
- Proposes that our conscious experiences are associated with brain events that actualize new quantum states
- This association brings closure to the theory and provides a basis for understanding consciousness within physical theory
- Naturalistic approach: understands complex thoughts as constructed by natural processes out of elemental components

**Importance of Putting in Seeds of Consciousness**
- Classical mechanics does not entail the existence of consciousness, as it has no reference to psychological qualities
- The most parsimonious quantum ontology, the Bohr/Heisenberg/von Neumann/Wigner wave-function-collapse model, already includes conscious experiences within its theoretical framework
- This was done to provide a rationally coherent and practically useful physical theory that accommodates experimental evidence

#### Consciousness Evolution: Brain Collapses and Quantum Mechanics

**Retaining Consciousness in Theory of Natural Selection**

**Conscious Events and Mathematical Representation:**
- Conscious events have an image in physicist's description of nature through sequence of collapse events
- Contracted idealike structure akin to thought process
- Cohesive reality brought into being, grasping information unit over large spatial region

**Challenges for Consciousness and Survival Advantage:**
- Classical mechanics and quantum mechanics give same physical predictions in many cases
- Conscious process unnecessary if classical mechanics adequate for behavior explanation
- Study survival advantages through nonclassical mechanical features

**Context of Good Measurement:**
- Process corresponds to "good measurement"
- Wave function divides into several branches with confined pointer variables
- Collapses occur after separation and conform to Born rule

**Bohm's Deterministic Model:**
- Accounts for much quantum phenomena without mentioning consciousness or collapses
- Predictions same as orthodox Copenhagen rules in "good measurement" context

**Potential Effect of Consciousness on Survival:**
- Difficult to establish effect if collapses occur only under good measurement conditions
- Evolution may not differ significantly from Bohm's statistical model without involving consciousness
- Collapses in brain could occur under non-good measurement conditions for potential effect on survival prospects.

**Naturalistic Explanation of Consciousness:**
- Requires existence of complex human consciousness to be explained naturally
- Classical mechanics does not specify how consciousness enters, leaving room for interpretation
- Bohr/Heisenberg/von Neumann/Wigner formulation provides a toehold for explanation but doesn't guarantee success.

#### Accelerating Abductive Problem Solving with Collapses of Neurological Activity

**Naturalistic Approach to Understanding Thought Processes**

**Technical Foundations for a Naturalistic Approach**:
- Previous versions (Stapp, 1996a, b) explored this approach without space limitations
- Lifting the "good-measurement" condition and considering collapses as patterns of neurological activity can lead to:
  - Significant speedup compared to classical or Bohm-described processes
  - Brain processes searching for abductive solutions, providing a survival advantage

**Rationale for Favoring Top-Level Brainwide Events**:
- Stapp (1994): Reasons why top-level brainwide events are favored over lower-level events:

### 52 Why Are Quantum Theorists Interested in Consciousness? Euan J. Squires*

**Chapter 52: Why Quantum Theorists Are Interested in Consciousness?**

**Quantum Theory**:
- A wonderful, elegant theory that calculates probabilities for various systems and experiments
- Accurate and universal, with no known violations of its predictions
- Applies to all physical and chemical systems, except under very special circumstances

**The Problem of Measurement**:
- If quantum theory applies to everything, there can be no unmeasured systems or events
- This leads to the "measurement problem": how can we make sense of measurements in a universe governed by quantum theory?

**Consciousness and Quantum Theory**:
- Consciousness is not something that can be explained, it just "is" (last section)
- What cannot be explained is that when measuring a quantum system, the resulting state corresponds to a definite result (0 or 1), even though the physical system itself does not have a definite state until measurement is performed.
- This seems to imply that consciousness plays a role in "collapsing" the wavefunction into a definite outcome.

**Derivation of the Result**:
- Melinda, the observer, would consistently write down the result (0 or 1) even if the underlying state was a superposition of both outcomes.
- This shows that consciousness is able to "choose" one of the possible outcomes, even though the physical system itself does not have a definite state until measurement.
- This implies that consciousness may play a role in "collapsing" the wavefunction and determining the outcome of a measurement.

#### Quantum Theory and Consciousness: A One-Mind Interpretation

**Quantum Theory and Consciousness**

**Measurement Problem in Quantum Theory**:
- The Born rule, which relates the ratio of results seen by an observer to probabilities, is not a direct consequence of the Schrödinger equation (evolution equation) in quantum theory.
- It requires adding "rule" to explain why certain results are observed in a set of experiments.

**Naïve Many-Worlds Interpretation**:
- Proposes that after a measurement, there exist two different "Melindas", each experiencing one result.
- The physical world remains the same, but consciousness selects one of the results.
- This interpretation does not work because it lacks probabilities (Born rule).

**One-Mind Interpretation**:
- Proposes that consciousness selects one term in a quantum superposition at random, with weights given by Born rule.
- Allows for consciousness to affect the experienced world and addresses free will.
- Suggests the brain is a quantum system capable of making quantum measurements.

**Comparison with Classical Physics**:
- The requirement that quantum effects occur in the brain does not seem unreasonable, given that classical matter does not exist.
- A unique "real" (experienced world) would exist, while non-selected parts would not.

**Anthropic Arguments**:
- This interpretation allows for anthropic arguments to explain apparent coincidences necessary for our existence.

#### Quantum Physics and Consciousness: A Non-local Connection

**Many-Worlds Interpretation and Nonlocality**

**Single Experience Proposal**:
- Consciousness selects a part in which consciousness can exist
- This model works, but requires an infinite number of "objects" associated with a given person

**Continuous Parameter Model**:
- All "minds" labeled by a continuous parameter (0 < l < 1)
- Fraction of line goes to one result, another fraction to another, giving the Born rule
- Problem: No natural measure occurs on such a line

**One World vs. Many Worlds**:
- Prefer the idea of one world rather than having to accept all things that can be actually are
- It seems too much to believe that people really are holding conferences who have never experienced interference or read about it

**Nonlocality and Consciousness**:
- Nonlocality is removed from physics, but still present in consciousness
- Consciousness needs to "know about" probabilities, requiring a nonlocal process
- Ensures that all observers make the same selection, ensuring consistency

**Related Ideas**:
- **Selection model**: Identifies consciousness as a primitive ingredient of the world, not reducible to other physics
- Distinguishes from models that associate collapse with consciousness
- Requires making more precise to calculate observable differences from standard quantum theory

**Summary**:
- Orthodox quantum theory requires "something else," which may be identified with consciousness
- Models show why this consciousness is causally effective, but identifying the mechanisms in the brain for magnifying quantum selections into macroscopic effects is a problem for the future.

### 53 Synaptic Transmission, Quantum-State Selection, and Consciousness Friedrich Beck

**Synaptic Transmission, Quantum-State Selection, and Consciousness**

**Neural Net and Instability**:
- Nerve impulses are stochastic processes in the living brain
- Recent investigations suggest the neural net stays close to instability
- This allows it to be switched between different states by minute actions

**Regulator for Coherent Pattern**:
- A stable regulator is needed to generate a coherent pattern in active cortical units
- The decisive unit in this regulator is a **quantum trigger** that determines the onset of synaptic exocytosis upon an incoming nerve impulse

**Synaptic Transmission and Quantum Processes**:
- Exocytosis is an all-or-nothing process, occurring with less than 1 probability per impulse
- Synaptic transmission qualifies as a basic regulator of brain activities
- This function has been demonstrated in biochemical studies on ion-channel properties of the synaptic membrane

**Quantum Trigger and Robustness**:
- A quantum trigger must function on an atomic level to be robust against thermal fluctuations
- Quantum effects in biological membranes have been observed in photosynthesis with bacteria

**Quantum Amplitudes and Regulating Pattern**:
- The quantum amplitudes of the corresponding tunneling process determine the small exocytosis probabilities
- These form a regulating pattern for the coupled cortical unit

**Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness**:
- Quantum processes are important in the relation between brain activity and conscious action
- Some argue that the noncomputable performance of a conscious brain can be understood only by evoking a **quantum-mechanical state collapse**, or state-selection mechanism
- This condition is fulfilled for quantum states but hard to establish for macroscopic quantum states at room temperature

#### Quantum Mechanics and Neuron Functionality in Spine Synapses

**Key Points:**
- Apical bundles of dendrites are the basic anatomical units in neocortex
- Synaptic connectivity is established mainly through spine synapses, covering thousands of apical dendrites
- Spine synapse structure includes a presynaptic membrane and a release mechanism for transmitter molecules
- Exocytosis is the key regulatory function of a spine synapse, involving quantum processes on the electronic level
- Two energy regimes: quantal (Equ) vs. thermal (Eth)
  - Estimates suggest critical quasi-particle mass Mc ~ 6MH and signal time w ~ 30ps
  - Indicates involvement of quantum processes in brain dynamics, especially electronic transitions like electron transfer or bond changes
- Macroscopic vs. microscopic dynamics:
  - Macroscopic (milliseconds to nanoseconds) involves neural net and cellular processes
  - Microscopic (picoseconds to femtoseconds) involves quantum processes in individual microsites
- Synaptic emission, or exocytosis, is a regulating process with two features:
  1. All-or-nothing quantal vesicular release
  2. Low probability of occurrence (<< 1) after nerve impulse
- Proposed model for synaptic transmission includes quantum trigger mechanism:
  - Nerve impulse excites electronic configuration to metastable state
  - Quasi-particle tunnels through potential barrier separating states, leading to exocytosis or inhibition.

#### State collapse transforms this expression into Using the WKB approximation (Messiah 1961) to solve the tunneling problem, we can once more evaluate th...

**Quantum Mechanics in Brain Dynamics: Understanding Consciousness through Quantum Events**

**Introduction:**
- Discusses quantum mechanics' role in brain dynamics and consciousness
- Emphasizes unpredictability of state collapse as a fundamental concept of quantum mechanics

**Key Points:**
1. **Quantum State Collapse**: Nonpredictable process distinguishing quantum mechanics from classical physics, leading to past vs future distinction and understanding consciousness scientifically.
2. **Role of Exocytosis in Brain Activity**: All-or-nothing event occurring with probability less than 1; can be related to two-state quantum trigger using electron transfer model for better understanding brain dynamics and consciousness.
3. **Coherent Coupling of Synapses**: Open problem regarding microtubular connections, but not essential for producing spatio-temporal patterns in cortical units.
4. **Microtubular Cell Connections**: Establish nonalgorithmic units of consciousness through cooperative processes and bundles of pyramidal cells (dendrons).
5. **Importance of Understanding Quantum Events:** Distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical physics, offering new insights into brain functioning and consciousness.

**Background:**
- Spine synapses regulate brain activity by filtering nerve impulses.
- Exocytosis is an all-or-nothing event occurring with probability less than 1.
- Model based on electron transfer relates exocytosis to two-state quantum trigger, leading to superposition of states and state collapse.

**Microtubular Connections:**
- Coherent coupling of synapses via microtubules is an open problem in understanding the relationship between brain dynamics and consciousness.
- Quantum coherence not necessary for coupling microsites with definite phase relations to produce spatio-temporal patterns.
- The quantum trigger can switch between coherent modes (limit cycles?).

**Notes:**
1. For the present status of the discussion on dualist-interactionism, identity theory, and materialism, see Eccles (1994).
2. An alternative regulative process by tubulin molecules comprising the cylindrical walls of microtubules has been proposed by Hameroff and Penrose (1996). The basic quantal event postulated by these authors is similar to the synaptic quantum-trigger model presented here, but their mechanism for electron transfer across the presynaptic membrane violates conditions given in section two above.

### 54 A Sonoran Afternoon Stuart R. Hameroff and Alwyn C. Scott

**Stuart Hameroff and Alwyn Scott's Discussion on Quantum Theories of Mind**

**Agreement between Stuart and Alwyn**:
- Both feel uncomfortable with the idea that mind is just brain activity (neurons switching on/off)
- Both looking for something more

**Differences in Perspectives**:
- Alwyn sees no need for quantum theory in understanding nonlinear dynamics of the brain
- Stuart believes consciousness requires both classical nonlinearity and quantum effects, particularly at the level of microtubules

**Orch OR Model**:
- Proposed model by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff to explain consciousness
- Involves a "noncomputable" collapse of the wave function in quantum coherent microtubule states
- Alternates between quantum isolation phases (gel) and classical signaling open phases (sol)

**Challenges with Quantum States**:
- Classical phenomena like nerve impulses cannot be explained by Schrödinger's equation
- Minimum length of waves used to construct wave packets is much too small for biochemists to worry about

**Superposition and Significance**:
- Even a small fraction of an atomic diameter separation can lead to quantum coherent superposition
- Implications come from the quantum-coherent binding, self-collapse events, and noncomputable selection of postcollapse states.

#### The key point is that for tubulin at biological temperatures, the size of a quantum-wave packet is much less than the size of a protein molecule. For...

**Understanding Quantum Theory and Protein Dynamics**

**Background:**
- Stuart raises a question about quantum mechanics' role in protein dynamics and its relevance to understanding consciousness (the "hard problem")
- Al suggests that the intricacy of brain dynamics is a richer source of mystery than quantum theory can provide

**Quantum Theory vs. Classical Approaches:**
- Classically, proteins are complex nonlinear systems with thousands of electrons, protons, and neutrons
- Electron delocalization may affect nuclear motion and conformation
- Born-Oppenheimer approximation assumes negligible electron mass compared to nuclei but doesn't always hold for some intraprotein electrons
- Quantum protein computing suggests superposition of electron states contributes to interference effects, jiggling nuclei, and conformational self-organization

**Brain Functioning vs. Life:**
- Brains composed of neurons, synapses, and glial cells like living organisms are made up of chemical atoms
- Complex nonlinear and hierarchical structures in body and brain, where mystery lies

**Single-Cell Organisms:**
- Intelligent, adaptive behavior seen in single-cell organisms without neural networks or synapses
- Unknown hierarchical levels and interactions between them

**Neuron Assemblies:**
- Neurons organize themselves into assemblies of neurons with global coherence, binding, and threshold phenomena
- Assemblies can organize themselves into higher levels up to functional dynamic entities underlying human consciousness

**Perspective:**
- Stuart suggests quantum mechanics may be necessary for describing fundamental life processes in bacteria
- Al argues that neurophysiological experiments provide little insight into the nature of conscious experience and casts doubt on the relevance of quantum theory to protein dynamics.

#### Discussion on Consciousness and Quantum Effects in Proteins between Stuart Hameroff and Al Knysh

**Quantum Effects in Proteins and Consciousness**

**Stuart's Perspective:**
- Agrees that a theory of consciousness must integrate philosophy, physics, and neurobiology
- Believes quantum effects may be relevant for understanding consciousness, despite experimental challenges
- Suggests Orch OR model as an approach to describing reality at its most basic level where experience may reside
- Favoring nonlinear dynamics over quantum theory due to intuition and professional experience

**Al's Perspective:**
- Argues that physics and mathematics will have minor roles in integrating consciousness
- Skeptical about the value of a new force field or theoretical imagination without experimental evidence
- Focuses on hierarchical dynamics as an alternative explanation for consciousness
- Acknowledges difficulty in characterizing consciousness but emphasizes the importance of neural networks and nonlinear lattice theory for understanding it.

**Disagreements:**
- Different intuitions regarding the significance of quantum effects in microtubules vs. classical nonlinear dynamics
- Debate over whether Orch OR can explain difficult issues like binding, free will, noncomputability without addressing hard problem of experience (nature of consciousness).

## XII TIME AND CONSCIOUSNESS

**Time and Consciousness**

**Overview**:
- Mental life realities are dynamic, thoughts and feelings change moment by moment
- Understanding consciousness requires appreciating time's nature

**Physics Perspective**:
- Physicists view time as an independent variable in fundamental equations
- Time has no direction in these formulations (Maxwell, Einstein, Schrödinger)
- Some physicists suggest the universe may eventually collapse and time could flow backward
- Others argue entropy would increase, preserving the direction of time

**Philosophical Perspective**:
- Time does not truly flow according to some philosophers
- Time is a "mythical" concept, just a motion with respect to hypertime

**Biological and Psychological Perspective**:
- Life and mind have a sense of time's direction and flow
- Examples: development in an individual organism, metabolic process, evolution
- Consciousness involves a "specious present" and the future becoming the past

**Mathematical Perspective**:
- Applied mathematicians view time as a flexible concept
- Depends on hierarchical level of description
- Time scales vary greatly for different dynamic processes
- Consciousness may involve distinct events with variable passage of time

**Exploration of Time in Different Contexts**:
1. **Big Brown Bat Eptesicus fuscus**: Precision in measuring time delays on the engineer's clock (20 nanoseconds)
2. **Trappist Monastery Study**: Two types of time perception: profane, linear and abstract vs. altered state of consciousness

**Significance of Studying Time in Consciousness Research**:
- Exploratory yet significant for future research in the science of consciousness.

### 55 Time Expansion and the Perception of Acoustic Images in the Big Brown Bat, Eptesicus fuscus Prestor A. Saillant and James A. Simmons

**The Big Brown Bat's Perception of Acoustic Images**

**Neural Correlates of Perception**:
- Measured in time scales ranging from 1 to 100 msec

**Mammalian Auditory System Processing**:
- Information processing occurs on a different time scale, extending down to 1 to 10 msec
- Humans can discriminate differences in the time of arrival of 1-kHz tones at their two ears of 11 msec
- The big brown bat can detect changes in the arrival time of echoes in the sub-msec range

**Integrating Information on Different Time Scales**:
- Sensory fusion requires integrating representations from different sensory modalities
- **Synchronized timing of neural activity** in the msec range may have important implications for perception of visual objects
- Neurons with nonoverlapping receptive fields demonstrate higher synchronization when stimulated by a single object compared to two separate objects

**Brain as a Time Machine**:
- The brain is a time machine rather than simply a series of topological or functional neuronal maps
- Relatively new findings on bat sonar at Brown University suggest that msec-scale information present in auditory stimuli can affect the timing of local evoked potentials on a msec scale

**Time Expansion as a Temporal "Zoom Lens"**:
- The time-expansion effect may function as a temporal "zoom lens" that provides signal-processing advantages to the mammalian auditory system
- Time-expanded representations with ratios of 1:10 to 1:100 have been found in the auditory system of the big brown bat
- This time expansion may provide a substrate for **wavelet-like processing strategies** in the bat auditory system, conferring additional scale and rotation invariance, sparse 3-D matrix compression, and the integration of msec-scale processes with other msec-scale processes in the brain.

#### Time Expansion for Invariant Processing and Data Compression in Sensory Systems

**3-D Data Compression and Time Expansion**

**Converting Spatial to Temporal Units**:
- Dimensions of 3-D objects converted to temporal units make time expansion easier for invariant representations of scaled or rotated objects

**Example: Rotating Wires**
- Figure 55.3 shows a SCAT image of three wires as they are rotated in space
- Upper and lower plots show the same SCAT image, with lines drawn to clarify results
- Spacing between wires is shown in the inset on the right side
- Vertical axis represents distance or time between wire pairs for different orientations (0° to 30°)
- At 0°, all wires are nearly the same distance from the artificial bat's ear
- As we rotate the wires, it is similar to stretching the vertical axis, which would be equivalent to time expansion
- A rotation-invariant representation of the three wires could be achieved by variable time expansion

**Time Expansion and Data Compression**:
- Time expansion and contraction are the basis for wavelet processing
- Two forms of data compression from expanded representations:
  - Reducing number of templates stored in memory, allowing one template to represent a range of object orientations
  - Using dynamic time expansion on sensory data to match signal to stored template

**Visual System Analogy**:
- In the visual system, only the retinal fovea has an expanded representation in the visual cortex
- High spatial resolution is possible in the central region, without overwhelming the visual system with high-resolution information from the periphery
- This form of data compression allows for greater expanses of space to be represented at very high resolution

**Time Expansion and Acoustic Fovea**:
- The need to process sensory data at close to real time prevents continuous time expansion of all input streams
- Time expansion may provide the auditory system with an "acoustic fovea" phenomenon, allowing it to zoom in on important stimuli while minimizing representation of uninteresting portions of space

### 56 Context, Conditioning, and Meaning of Time-Consciousness in a Trappist Monastery Van A. Reidhead and John B. Wolford

**Understanding Time-Consciousness in a Trappist Monastery**

**Key Questions**:
- Can a community intentionally reenculturate adults to a specialized kind of time-consciousness?
- How are alternative experiences of time conditioned?
- Do alternate forms of time-consciousness have measurable effects?

**Literature**:
- Alternative kinds of time-consciousness: "profane" and "sacred" (Eliade)
  - Profane time is linear, sacred time is neither homogeneous nor continuous
  - Sacred time is inexhaustible, always present, never changing, always equal to itself
  - Profane time is bounded by birth and death
- Ritual process as a methodology for transporting people to alternate perceptions of time-space relationships (Turner)
  - Historical time is redeemed, cyclically, by infusions of creative energy from ritually evoked antistructural time-consciousness
- Postmodernist critique of linear time
  - Time is anarchic and disconnected, but inheres in relational significance

**Time in a Trappist Monastery**:
- Time predominantly lived cyclically (24 hours, biweekly, seasonally, annually)
- Monks experience all time as sacred, but nested in profane, historical, linear time
- Reidhead's ethnographic study: interviewing 10 monks on their beliefs and experiences of time

**Results from Interviews**:
- **Question 1**: Normal awareness of the date
  - Five reported general unawareness, unconcerned
  - Five reported awareness, attributed to administrative duties or attentiveness to liturgy
- No convergence between spirituality practiced and awareness/unawareness of the date

#### Monastic Time Consciousness and its Connection with Present Focus

**Monk's Perspective on Time and God:**

**Contemplative Consciousness**:
- Monks emphasize liturgical cycle's structure and content, which is nested in standard time
- Contemplative consciousness is conversant with normal, linear time

**Focus on Past, Present, or Future**:
- One monk reported persistent preoccupation with the past, causing cognitive dissonance
- Another monk thought often about the past but explained it as regrets about time usage
- Present focus is important to avoid stress and maintain health

**Encountering God**:
- All ten monks agreed that God can only be encountered in the present
- Past and future are not real in the same way as the present

**Choir's Effect on Experience of Time**:
- Monks agree that participation in choir focuses on the present
- Monks have wandering minds, but choir time helps bring them back to mindfulness of God

**Productivity and Focus on Present**:
- Nine out of ten monks reported improved efficiency and productivity when focusing on the present
- Regularity, predictability, and stability are essential for maintaining mindfulness of God

**Role of God in Monastic Method**:
- Belief in God is central to the monastic method
- Love of the Divine Office (choir) is a key criterion for vocation as a monk
- Monks view time, not space, as the key physical variable in their system

#### Trappist Monastery Time-Consciousness Conditioning

**Trappist Monastic Structure and Time-Consciousness**

**Conditioning System for Altering Time-Consciousness:**
* Belief in monastic principles: essential foundation
* Obedience to time structure: disciplined living
* Discipline: follows belief, yields altered consciousness

**Beneficial Byproducts:**
1. High-quality work productivity
2. Longer, healthier lives (needs further research)

**Complexity of Consciousness Conditioning:**
* Individual mental systems and abilities vary
* Western cultural time dominance imposes linearity
* Monks contextualize time by Western norms but structure their own antistructural temporal orientation
* Profound belief in God sustains discipline until present time-consciousness is achieved

**Methodological Approach:**
* Integration of quantitative and qualitative research methods
* Understanding monks' complex interplay between standard cultural understanding and religious life.

## XIII TRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOLOGY

**Transpersonal Psychology and Methodologies for a Comprehensive Science of Consciousness**

**Overview:**
- Transpersonal psychology: study of experiences beyond individual self ( Institute of Transpersonal Psychology)
- Focus on people's experiences of transcending personal boundaries
- Includes cosmic consciousness (CC), a consciousness of the universe's life and order
- Scientific understanding needed for CC experiences

**Charles Tart’s Perspective:**
- Transpersonal psychology: studying experiences beyond ordinary self
- Cosmic Consciousness Experience (CC) goes beyond intellectual insight
- Carefully described by Allan Smith, an academic researcher in anesthesiology
  - Unusual sensation in perineal area
  - Light seemed to increase and become one with the sunset
  - Elation, ecstatic state, timeless being
  - Absolute knowingness: deep understanding without words
  - Impact on life: gave up academic career to explore spirituality
- Transpersonal experiences can be less dramatic but still life-changing

**Methodology:**
- Understanding these experiences requires clarity about methodology of study.

#### Scientific Method and Bias in Consciousness Research

**Methodological Considerations for a Science of Consciousness**

**Scientific Method vs. Scientism**:
- Factuality: Accurately and honestly describe data
- Theory development: Make sense of data, relate to other areas of knowledge
- Logic: Recognize all logics are semiarbitrary, no ultimate validity
- Testing predictions against new observations
- Open communication with colleagues for mutual enrichment

**Scientism vs. Science**:
- Mistaking simulations of reality for reality
- Institutionalized bias in favor of certain areas of research
- Prejudices against parapsychology and other "forbidden" subjects
- Ignoring transpersonal experiences in consciousness research

**Introspective Psychology**:
- Early attempts to create a "science of the mind" using introspection failed due to:
  - Grossly inadequate training for observers
  - Unrealistic expectations about the normal, restless mind

**Training Observers**:
- Introspective psychology failed because observers were not properly trained
- Meditation techniques can help improve observer's ability to observe their own consciousness

#### Introspective Psychology's Limitations and the Need for Awareness of Biases

**Key Points:**

**The Challenges of Observing Mental Processes:**
- Conversations with Buddhist meditation teachers suggest intensive meditation training is required for accurate self-observation (approx. 5000 hours)
- Personal experience and research indicate automatic internal simulations are biased and distorted, making self-reported data potentially inaccurate

**Bias among Experimenters:**
- Subtle experimenter bias can influence subject behavior during scientific research
- Unrecognized factor in early introspective psychology but still prevalent issue

**Individual Differences:**
- Belief that fundamental laws of mind could be quickly discovered through introspection
- Lack of agreement among observers reflects individual differences, not method's failure
- Adequate description of phenomena in consciousness research is essential to avoid misunderstandings

**Altered States and State-Specific Sciences:**
- Consciousness functions differently in altered states, which should be investigated further
- Proposal for applying basic scientific methods in various ASCs leading to state-specific sciences

**The Need for Methodologies Specifically Appropriate to Consciousness:**
- Different types of consciousness experiences require unique methodologies
- Transpersonal experiences, such as contact with the "whole and benign universe," can influence a person's life significantly

**Conclusion:**
- Thorough investigation is necessary to develop a comprehensive science of consciousness
- Sensitivity towards adequate training for observers, bias in experimenters, individual differences, and exploring altered states.

### 58 States and Stages of Consciousness: Current Research and Understandings Roger Walsh

**Understanding Consciousness: Current Research and Perspectives**

**Definition of Consciousness**: There is no clear agreement on a definition for consciousness, yet people have attempted to change it throughout history through various methods.

**Altered States of Consciousness (ASCs)**: ASCs have been institutionalized in 90% of cultures, indicating their importance. Systematic study of ASCs began primarily by transpersonal psychologists in the late 1960s as part of the transpersonal movement.

**Transpersonal Psychology**: Transpersonal psychology arose to explore possibilities beyond the scope of mainstream psychology and pathology-focused disciplines like behaviorism and psychoanalysis. It focused on peak experiences, which were initially thought to be spontaneous, brief, and overwhelming but could potentially be stabilized as altered traits of consciousness through practices such as yoga and meditation.

**States of Consciousness**: Research has recognized more and more alternate states of consciousness, contrasting with the conventional Western view that there are few primary pathological states. Some early transpersonal pioneers discovered families of potential transpersonal states but were initially resisted due to cultural biases towards monophasic perspectives.

**Categorizing States**: The challenge was to differentiate and compare various ASCs produced by different disciplines, with significant differences between states. Phenomenological mapping and deep structural analyses could provide a more precise and multidimensional comparison of these states.

#### Deep Structural Analysis of Transpersonal States and Stages

**Phenomenological Mapping of Transpersonal States**
- Comparison of shamanic, yogic, and Buddhist practices reveals differences in experiential dimensions: control, awareness of environment, concentration, arousal, emotion, self-sense, content of experience (Table 58.1)
- Precise mapping allows for better understanding of transpersonal states and differentiation from pathological states

**Deep Structural Analysis**
- Identification of commonalities among states through deep structural analysis
- Application of developmental structuralism to cluster contemplative experiences into major stages: subtle, causal, nondual

**Subtle Stage**
- Quiet mind reveals inner world of subtle mental phenomena (formless or specific forms)

**Causal Stage**
- Deepening and stabilizing of subtle states leads to pure consciousness or unmanifest realm devoid of objects, images, or phenomena

**Nondual Stage**
- Objects and images reappear as projections or modifications of consciousness
- Recognition that consciousness creates space, time, and limits; final realization known as enlightenment, liberation, wu, moksha, or fana.

**Open-Mindedness Regarding Ontologies**
- Nondual experience suggests a radical philosophical idealism (consciousness as primary) but has not been proven by science or philosophy
- Participants in Tucson conferences were primarily materialists; no ontology has been definitively proven.

#### Contemplative Traditions: Unveiling Transpersonal States and Consciousness Development

**Contemplatives' Suggestions about Meditation and Consciousness:**
* Deeper meditation leads to richer array of ASCs (Alter States of Consciousness)
* Further exploration of mind through contemplative practices reveals consciousness’ remarkable creative capacity
* Philosophical idealism: consciousness can create an objective, material world
* Evidence from laboratory studies and dreaming analogy support this idea

**Support for Enlightenment:**
* Heightened awareness in waking and sleeping states observed among advanced meditators
* Faster perceptual processing speed and sensitivity (tachistoscopic studies)
* Lucid dreaming as a metaphor for enlightenment: recognizing the internal creation of external reality

**Usual State of Consciousness:**
* Human condition offers possibilities beyond the recognized normal state
* Contemplative traditions agree that usual consciousness is suboptimal and distorted (maya or illusion)
* Unconsciousness in daylight hours and lucid awareness during dreams aim for continuous consciousness

**Understanding States and Stages of Consciousness:**
* Recognizing multiple states, mapping families of peak experiences, understanding monophasic culture
* Common structures underlying transpersonal experiences, identifying common developmental sequences across traditions
* Scientific evidence supporting efficacy of contemplative disciplines (hundreds of studies on meditation)
* Beginning to understand enlightenment or liberation from an scientific perspective.

## XIV PARAPSYCHOLOGY

**Parapsychology: A Contentious Issue in Consciousness Studies**

**Overview**:
- Parapsychology explores "anomalous" effects not fitting a mechanistic view of reality, such as extrasensory perception (ESP), mental telepathy, precognition, remote viewing, and psychokinesis
- Divided opinion among scientists: some dismiss it as primitive belief in magic; others find credible
- Controversial topic at Tucson II Conference in 1994

**Parapsychology vs. Mystical Experiences**:
- Evidence for mystical experiences clear and subjective, but question of how to explain them scientifically
- Parapsychology proponents need to present credible demonstration that data are not artifactual
- Important implications for the science of consciousness if proven valid

**Critique of Parapsychology**:
- Susan Blackmore:
  - Found only negative results in her work as a parapsychologist
  - Observed fraud and incompetence in some labs
  - Contends psi effects are not credible due to low significance compared to other scientific subjects
- Dick Bierman:
  - Accepting parapsychology may depend on tolerance for paradox
  "Retropsychokinesis" experiments have positive results with very low probability of random chance
  Suggests psi effects are acausal connections like quantum physics' nonlocal correlations

**Perspective**:
- Laypeople face difficulty untangling claims and counterclaims
- Proponents need to recognize data remain less convincing to unbiased scientists
- More effort needed to explain psi phenomena if any are not artifactual, rather than just questioning them

### 59 Parapsychology: Fact or Fiction? Replicable Evidence for Unusual Consciousness Effects Marilyn Schlitz and Edwin May

**Parapsychology: Fact or Fiction? Replicable Evidence for Unusual Consciousness Effects**

**Definition of Parapsychology**:
- Scientific study of psi phenomena, unusual exchanges of information or energy (e.g., extrasensory perception, psychokinesis)
- Psi is a descriptive label, not suggesting "psychic" explanations or underlying mechanisms

**Belief in Parapsychology**:
- Recent surveys show many Americans believe in ESP and PK
- Public beliefs are not reliable indicators of objective science
- Anecdotes do not have the same reliability as the scientific method

**Issues for Evaluating Psi Phenomena**:
- Belief vs. evidence is not straightforward
- Scientific understanding of reality has shifted over time (e.g., acceptance of meteorites)
- Controversy and skepticism limit clear evaluation
- Importance of objectively evaluating data, not suppressing knowledge

**Evaluating Replication in the Psi Database**:
- Parapsychologists use meta-analysis to assess large bodies of data
- Key issues: file-drawer problem, statistical power, replication
- Exact vs. conceptual replications: protect against misinterpretations and fraud

**Extrasensory Perception (ESP)**:
- Operational definition: acquiring information without known senses
- Two main methodologies: forced-choice and free-response
- Similar protocols for each trial:
  - Target chosen randomly from defined possibilities
  - Individual blind to target registers impressions
  - Statistical valid technique used to determine if result exceeds chance

#### ESP Experiments: Forced Choice and Free Response Methods

**Forced-Choice ESP Testing:**
- Experimenters use Zener cards with symbols: circle, square, star, wavy lines, cross (25 cards per symbol)
- Probability of observing x hits in n trials with 0.2 chance hit probability calculated using exact binomial calculation
- Honorton (1975) reviewed studies between 1934 and 1939, effect size was 0.013 ± 0.001, overall combined effect of 12.7 sigma
- Modern meta-analytical tools used to review precognition card-guessing database: nearly 2 million individual trials contributed by over 50,000 subjects
- Combined effect size was 0.020 ± 0.002, overall effect of 11.4 sigma (high level of confidence)
- No significant correlation between study quality and criticism; effect sizes are small but statistically robust and stable

**Free-Response ESP Testing:**
- Includes ganzfeld and remote-viewing types with various target materials: video clips, photographs, geographic locations
- Differences from forced-choice methodology: target material can be almost anything and no specific response required
- Ganzfeld technique designed for introspective psychologists to induce imagery experiences (reduced sensory information enhances perception) but fell out of use with behaviorism's rise
- Subject in a mild state of sensory isolation, induced by taping translucent Ping-Pong-ball halves over each eye and illuminating them with soft red light, creating an audio equivalent with white noise
- After impressions, subject presented defined target pack including correct and decoy targets; hit rate for nearly 500 trials: 0.32 to 0.41 (95% confidence), allowing rejection of null hypothesis
- Remote-viewing protocol differs in monitor facilitating drawing information from viewer and independent analyst performing analysis, not just viewing impressions
- Utts (1996) analyzed published ganzfeld studies and governmentsponsored remote-viewing studies; found five additional ganzfeld replications worldwide, combined hit rate for 2878 trials: 0.33 ± 0.02 with 95% confidence

**Psychokinesis (PK):**
- Operationally defined as interacting with physical world by mental means alone
- Difficulty ensuring no normal events occurred, especially for physical effects which are problematic and expensive to verify
- PK phenomena categorized into four groups: micro-, macro-, bio-, and psychophysiological effects. Focus on micro-PK due to difficulty observing macro-PK without visual inspection.

#### Parapsychology: Meta-Analysis of Psi Phenomena & Implications for Consciousness

**Mechanical or Electrical Targets**
- Most published studies on micro-PK involve true devices for generating random numbers
- Carefully designed binary-bit generator produces a data stream, interspersing active with control periods
- Subject attempts to modify output solely by mental means
- Radin and Nelson meta-analyzed 800+ studies from 1959-1987, assigning 16-point quality rating
- Computed overall weighted-effect size of approximately (3.0 ± 0.5) × 10^-4
- No correlation between study quality and outcome, results cannot be accounted for by poor protocols, inappropriate analyses, file-drawer effect, or fraud

**Biological Targets**
- Fewer studies than mechanical targets, but compelling evidence worthy of future research
- Best replications: experiments using electrodermal potential as target system
- Results indicate average amount of activity differs when intending to calm/activate compared with control periods
- May trigger distant healing response, potential for direct application
- Formal meta-analysis ongoing

**Conclusions on PSI Databases**
- Statistical results beyond chance in ESP and PK databases
- Not likely result from systematic flaws in methodology
- Parapsychologists can confidently reject null hypothesis
- Effect sizes small, comparable to recent medical breakthroughs
- If standards applied, psychic functioning thoroughly established
- Next question: implications for science of consciousness?

**Expanded Science of Consciousness**
- Scientific world seeks explanations for psi phenomena
- Data may help revise epistemological and ontological assumptions in modern science
- Need for new epistemology employing broader metaphors, questioning inviolable scientific laws
- Psi data may be part of another order of reality, not anomaly

**Conclusions on Parapsychology**
- Fact or fiction: review of meta-analyses leads to rejection of null hypothesis
- Challenge/opportunity to fill gaps in knowledge of what is natural

### 60 Why Psi Tells Us Nothing About Consciousness Susan Blackmore

**Consciousness vs. Psi: The Relationship Between the Two**

**Questions**
- Are there any paranormal phenomena?
- Do they help us understand consciousness?

**Assessment of Evidence for Psi**:
- Objective evaluation is impossible, as experts cannot agree on evidence
- Research has shown several experimental paradigms to be false or susceptible to fraud
- Ganzfeld experiment: Repeatable results questioned due to potential errors and lack of scientific rigor

**Personal Experience with the Ganzfeld Experiment**:
- Investigated ganzfeld experiments in 1978, detected errors and methodological issues
- Published findings expressing doubts about the results
- New autoganzfeld results raise questions due to personal experience and controversy surrounding earlier studies

**Implications for Understanding Consciousness**:
- Popular view: ESP/PK proves consciousness can bypass brain processes and affect things directly
- Personal perspective: Parapsychologists may be seeking to prove the power of consciousness, rather than understanding its limitations

#### First, to make their case that psi effects actually involve consciousness, experiments rather different from those commonly done will be needed. Let u...

**The Author's Perspective on Consciousness and Psi Effects**

**Ganzfeld Experiment:**
- No evidence of consciousness involvement
- Results may be due to other factors like altered state or random variables
- Appropriate control experiments needed to identify the source of success

**Remote Staring Experiments:**
- Subjects unable to consciously detect staring, but physiological responses suggest paranormal phenomenon
- Experiments demonstrate correlation between output and direction of aim
- Further tests required to determine what component of subject is causing effect

**PK Experiments:**
- Claim that consciousness is involved unjustified without proper controls or experiments
- Effects demonstrated as correlation between output and target direction, not causation
- Tests needed to identify what aspect of subject influences outcome (consciously or unconsciously)

**Understanding Consciousness and Parapsychology:**
- Complex relationship between consciousness and understanding its power
- Scientific community's perspective on consciousness challenges parapsychological claims
- Brain research suggests no single location for consciousness, raising questions about its role in causing actions.

#### Parapsychology's Role in Understanding Consciousness: Limited Progress due to Agent-Focused Approach

**Parapsychology: Proven or Misunderstood?**

**Background:**
- Parapsychology aims to prove consciousness can influence reality beyond personal bodies
- Despite spiritual connotations, some consider it less "spiritual" than conventional science due to the rise of interest in consciousness
- Scientists and philosophers investigate consciousness

**Current State of Parapsychology:**
- Focus on proving consciousness' power
- Research may hinder understanding of consciousness with limited progress towards revealing illusion of reality or helping escape it
- Misconception: parapsychology clings to the idea of consciousness as an agent (despite evidence suggesting otherwise)

**My Two Original Questions:**
1. Will evidence for psi help us understand consciousness?
Answer: Probably not, due to current focus on proving consciousness' power and potential limitations in research methods.
2. Can parapsychology bring together spiritual insights and scientific ones?
Answer: No, as parapsychology seems stuck on the idea of consciousness as an agent rather than integrating both perspectives for a comprehensive understanding.

### 61 Do Psi Phenomena Suggest Radical Dualism? Dick Bierman

**Psychical Research and Dualism**
- Founding fathers of psychical research believed reality transcends material world
- Early parapsychologists, like J. B. Rhine, considered these phenomena supported their dualist worldview
- Wigner's interpretation of quantum physics suggested consciousness should be different from matter
- Observational theories propose consciousness is involved in the "collapse" of state vector

**Psychokinesis Experiments**
- Meta-analytical findings suggest mental states may cause change in material systems
- Walker proposed consciousness could be the "hidden variable" to explain measurement problem
- Prerecorded target experiments showed significant correlations between observer's intention and RNG behavior at later time
- Review of all published PK experiments with prerecorded targets found combined z-score smaller than 1 in 10,000 chances of being due to chance

**Implications for Dualism**
- If psychokinesis on prerecorded targets is real, accepting mental states have causal effects on matter requires acceptance that causes may precede effects.
- Most cautious description: Anomalous correlations found between mental states and behavior of random physical systems within system constraints.

#### Psi Correlations Suggest Non-local Quantum Mental Interactions

**Conclusion:**
- If psi phenomena as described by Beloff are real (Bem and Honorton 1994, Radin and Nelson 1989), we need to reconsider their relation with a dualistic perspective on mind and matter due to new data presented in this chapter.
- The new data reflects the metacausal character of psi phenomena, complicating the naive picture of mental states driving material states proposed by the dualist perspective.
- These new data do not fit into any mechanistic framework whatsoever.
- Both the dualistic and materialistic perspectives are based on traditional cause-and-effect sequences, which do not apply to psychokinesis with prerecorded targets.
- The centrality of "time reversal" or "time independence" in theoretical approaches to psi phenomena (Stokes 1987) suggests that these parapsychological data may require an understanding that transcends traditional materialistic and some dualistic perspectives.
- It may be preferable to interpret parapsychological data as correlations without a cause, similar to the nonlocal correlations in physics that allow for no explanation by signals traveling from one part of the system to another.
- Von Lucadou (1994) proposes that psi correlations are an emergent property of macroscopic complex self-referential systems which are phenomenologically equivalent to nonlocal correlations in Quantum Physics, supporting nonreductionistic identity theories rather than dualistic theories on the relation between mind and matter.

## XV AESTHETICS AND CREATIVE EXPERIENCE

**Creativity and Aesthetics: The Role of Consciousness in Creative Problem Solving**
* **Overview:** Creative acts are a unique expression of human consciousness, where new ideas come to fruition. Poets are seen as magicians who bring the unimagined into reality. This chapter explores a model for creative problem solving that integrates Bernard Baars's global-workspace theory with an appraisal theory of emotion.
* **The Creative Process:** Søren Ulrik Thomsen describes the creative process as an eternal struggle between a desire to create and a terror of the process. Creators face insecurity, uncertainty, anxiety, and a sense of losing control when faced with a creative problem. However, they also experience intuitive feelings of knowing or being pulled in clear directions towards solutions, and joy when a solution is achieved.
* **Proposed Model:** This chapter proposes a model for creative problem solving that unites Baars's global-workspace theory of conscious experience and an appraisal theory of emotion. The primary claim is that the connections between cognition, emotion, and motivation are intrinsic to all conscious processing. The model rests on two presuppositions: consciousness evolved to help solve problems, and creative problem solving can be modeled as the search within and restructuring of a conceptual space.
* **Cognition, Emotion, and Motivation:**
	+ **Cognition**: Construction, comparison, or alteration of mental representations
	+ **Emotion**: Phenomenological experience and associated tendency toward action aroused by cognitive appraisal of personal significance
	+ **Motivation**: Psychological contexts that structure behavior and conscious experience according to personal significance
* **Theoretical Coupling:** Baars's global-workspace theory and an appraisal theory of emotion lend themselves to natural coupling. Consciousness is modeled as a global workspace where informative and accessible contents can be displayed, while the motivational hierarchy represents the individual's goals, knowledge, and behavioral potential. Violations of expectations in active contexts will gain access to consciousness for planning and decision making.
* **Creative Solutions:** Creative solutions transform the structure of a conceptual space, expand its boundaries, reveal uncharted areas, or change heuristics to enable novel solutions. Boden's criteria include: transformed structures, expanded boundaries, revealed previously uncharted areas, changed heuristics enabling novel solutions (Boden 1990).

#### Model for Creative Problem Solving: Emotional Appraisal and Contextual Restructuring

**Appraisal Theory of Emotion and Consciousness**
- Appraisal theories consider personal significance of information as a condition for emotional arousal
- Relevance to goals is crucial for emotion, but appraisals need not be conscious
- Emotions involve feelings, tendencies toward action, and continuing appraisals
- Baars' terminology: cognitive process of appraisal = subjective evaluation of motivation contexts vs. information
- Consciousness includes both cognitive and emotional aspects
- Creative problem solving involves restructuring conceptual spaces, challenging personal contexts, and eliciting emotions

**Model Figure 62.1 Depiction of the Model:**
1. **Consciousness of a Problem**: recognizing mismatch between individual's representation of a conceptual space and some internal or external state
2. **Initial Processes in Searching for Solutions**: exploring conceptual space, creating demand for restructuring, and activating contexts
3. **Conscious Effort Required**: metacognitive processes to direct attention, enlist effort, or select strategies
4. **Unconscious Context Decomposition and Restructuring**: allowing adaptive or novel solutions to arise
5. **Emotional Feedback**: positive feelings indicate progress towards creative solutions; negative feelings signal anxiety or difficulty in accessing deeper contexts.

#### Emotions and Motivation in Creative Problem-Solving: A Phenomenological Perspective

**Incubation in Creativity Literature**
- Emotions can be aroused during problem and solution cognition
- Conscious effort to restructure conceptual space or unconscious contexts can cause emotions
- Deep challenges to self may result in stronger emotional responses

**Fig. 62.1D: Discovering a Solution Leads to Change**
- Changing representation of conceptual space with solution = restructuring contexts
- Sudden achievement (insight) vs. gradually worked-out solution affects emotional character

**Emotions in Creative Problem Solving**
- Initiate and drive the process to completion
- Intimate interplay between cognition, emotion, motivation
- Conscious experience has cognitive and emotional aspects related to motivational contexts
- Emotional courage and motivational commitment necessary for success

**Phenomenological Evidence**
- Emotions essential in creative problem solving
- High stakes emotionally due to challenges to self-system
- Creative activity attracts because of tension between pleasure and pain, fear and absorption.

### 63 Dimensions of Creativity Aaron King and Alwyn C. Scott

**Dimensions of Creativity**

**Crick's Functionalism Argument**:
- Francis Crick's argument in "The Astonishing Hypothesis" that consciousness is the behavior of neurons and their associated molecules

**Limitations of Functionalism**:
- The authors aim to show that functionalism cannot describe essential features in creative brain activity
- Use a simple counting argument to demonstrate this

**Three Concepts**:
1. **Phase Space**: A theoretical space used to describe a system that changes with time, and its dimension
2. **Hierarchical Information Organization**: How information is stored in the brain
3. **Immense Numbers**: Finite numbers too large to be listed, labeld as "immense" by Walter Elsasser

**Argument Summary**:
- The number of dimensions required to describe creative brain activity is immense
- Creative brain activity cannot be represented in the neuronal phase space because it has more dimensions
- Creative brain activity is inherently unpredictable due to its immense phase space dimension

**William James' Critique**:
- William James' critique over a century ago of the "automaton-theory"
- Anticipated the authors' argument that modeling only neurons cannot describe creative processes like writing Hamlet

**Dynamical Systems and Phase Spaces**:
- Dynamical systems: States specified by a finite number of coordinates that change with time
- Phase space: Coordinates that specify possible system states
- Linear vs. Nonlinear Systems: Interactions between balls in the example lead to nonlinear dynamics

**Brain's Neuron Phase Space**:
- Specifying neuronal activity at every synapse would require a phase space of about 100 trillion dimensions
- Higher levels of biological organization involve increasingly complex systems

#### Exploring Cognitive Hierarchy in Shakespeare's Brain: Immeasurable Possibilities for Thought

**Hebb's Theory of Neural Assemblies and Phase Spaces**

**Introduction**:
- Members of social assemblies (e.g., hiking club, Junior League) share interconnected lists of addresses/phone numbers
- Each social assembly can be associated with higher-order assemblies
- At the highest level, activity is associated with a phase space dimension

**Limitations of Higher-Order Assemblies**:
- Unrealized possibilities must be included in the analysis to be comprehensive
- Astronomer's estimate of upper bound on events in the universe: one followed by 110 zeros

**Example of Proteins**:
- Protein molecule as a polymer chain of amino acids
- Imense number of possible proteins (20 raised to the power of 200)
- New, useful proteins can be discovered at any moment

**Hamlet Example**:
- Neurons organized into first-order cell assemblies for letters
- Second-order assemblies represent words
- Third-order assemblies represent lines in the play
- Dimension of phase spaces: 100 trillion (neural variables), 26 (letters), 100,000 (words), immense (lines and scenes)

**Conclusion**:
- Shakespeare cannot think of all possible lines for Hamlet's play, but new ideas can still emerge.

#### Neural Complexity Exceeds Computational Representation in Creative Thought

**The Dynamics of Shakespeare's Creative Activity**

**Immense Dimension of Creative Thought**:
- The number of possible scenes Shakespeare could explore is larger than the number of synapses in the brain by a factor of 10^180
- This complexity cannot be represented by counting neurological switchings at the neuron level
- The phase space of creative thought exceeds the dimensionality of cortical neurons, which are physically limited

**Limitations of Functionalism**:
- Functionalism fails to capture Shakespeare's creative activity as "the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules"
- The argument demonstrates that the number of possible higher-order assemblies is immense due to the hierarchical brain structure and combinatory relationship between levels
- Only a few possible assemblies form at the highest level, and only one is selected for the final play

**Potential for Artificial Creative Systems**:
- The argument does not prove that constructing an artificial creative system is impossible
- Such a system should take advantage of hierarchical structure like the human brain
- However, we have no assurance that its unpredictable activities would please us

### 64 Poetry, Mental Models, and Discordant Consciousness Paul K. Johnston

**Discourse on Human Consciousness: Poetry and Mental Models**

**Background:**
- Shakespeare's brain as a starting point for understanding human consciousness
- Focus on the peculiarities of human consciousness distinct from other creatures

**Limitation of Thoughts:**
- Limitations in addressing the hard problem of consciousness in biological creatures
- Personal experience and realization of self-destructive thoughts as a farmhand

**Language as a Tool for Thinking:**
- Human language serves as a tool for thinking
- Increases power to organize sensory input and create complex mental models
- Evolutionary advantages, but comes with the cost of mental disturbances

**Neural Discordancy and Emotion:**
- Brain experiences discordant neural nets as incapacitating emotion
- Poets and creative writers aware of unbearable neural discordancies
- Testing a first-rate intelligence: holding two opposed ideas simultaneously

**Consciousness, Culture, and Individuality:**
- Human consciousness becomes more complicated with cultural layers
- Added complexity increases the problem of opposition and discordancy
- Troilus and Cressida play as an example of this complex consciousness through language.

**Troilus and Cressida Play:**
- Expresses human struggle for ordering norms within society
- Debates on sexual behavior, civic behavior, personal behavior, and the role of language in shaping these debates
- Troilus reflects on battlefield discordancies outside Troy: "Peace, you ungracious clamors.".

**Language as a Source of Confusion:**
- Helen's beauty created by makeup (paint) instead of nature
- Blood painted not with makeup but with the blood of young men daily dying in battle for her sake.

#### Exploring Human Consciousness Conflict in Troilus & Cressida

**The Nature of Human Consciousness**

**Troilus and Cressida**:
- Play's plot: Hector is killed by Achilles due to Hector's removal of his own armor, not because of superior fighting skills
- Troilus witnesses Cressida's betrayal with Diomedes
- Troilus experiences conflicting realities about Cressida, unable to detach himself from the situation

**Consciousness and Discordancy**:
- Human consciousness falters when faced with opposed realities that are both true
- This discord becomes more common with greater powers of modeling (e.g., language)
- Troilus responds by devaluing Cressida, but this requires letting go of his love
- Thersites exhibits cynicism to avoid dealing with conflicting thoughts
- Other responses: Achilles' sulking, Paris' sensuousness, Ulysses' scheming

**Poetry as a Response**:
- Poetry resolves the discordant elements in the world while containing their disorder within the order of art
- This strengthens the mind and consciousness, enabling them to contain contradictions
- Poetry's biological function is to enable discordant human consciousness to continue its development

**Other Notes**:
- Troilus and Cressida was likely composed in 1602, with a complex subsequent publication history
- Drugs like benzodiazepines can enhance the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) and reduce neural discordancies
- The phenomenal world of mammals whose visual systems are closer to our own must be extraordinarily alien to human consciousness without language.
