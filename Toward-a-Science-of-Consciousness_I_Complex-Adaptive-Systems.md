# Toward a Science of Consciousness: The First Tucson Discussions and Debates (Complex Adaptive Systems)

> Scientists and philosophers are focusing more intensely than ever on the nature of our human experience, resulting in a newly coalescing field of Consciousness Studies that has become a worldwide and highly interdisciplinary phenomenon.
> 
> Toward a Science of Consciousness marks the first major gathering -- a landmark event -- devoted entirely to unlocking the mysteries of consciousness. It explores the whole spectrum of approaches from philosophy of mind and dream research, to neuropsychology, pharmacology, and molecular dynamics, to neural networks, phenomenological accounts, and even the physics of reality. The aim is to lay a sound scientific foundation for future research while also reaching consensus on many scattered areas of inquiry.
> 
> Following an overview, fifty-five chapters are divided into ten sections: philosophy, cognitive science, medicine/pathology, neurology, neural networks, subneural biology, quantum theory, non-locality in space and time, hierarchical organization, and phenomenology.
> 
> In addition to the editors, who are, respectively, an anesthesiologist, a psychologist, and an applied mathematician, contributors include such luminaries as David Chalmers, Michael Conrad, Avshalom Elitzur, Owen Flanagan, David Galin, John Kihlstrom, Christof Koch, Benjamin Libet, Roger Penrose, Karl Pribram, Gary Schwartz, Petra Stoerig, John Taylor, Andrew Weil, Fred Wolf, and many others. - [Toward a Science of Consciousness (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Toward-Science-Consciousness-Discussions-Adaptive/dp/0262527650/?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

## Summary

### Preface

**The Role of Consciousness in Science: Past and Present**
* The concept of consciousness has had a complex history in science
+ Dominant topic during William James's "Principles of Psychology"
+ Banned from polite discussion by behaviorists for decades
+ Reemergence with the rise of cognitive science and neuroscience in the 1960s and 1970s
* Understanding consciousness is now considered an important scientific goal
+ Scientists from various fields, including psychology, biochemistry, philosophy, computer science, neural network analysis, electrophysiology, quantum physics, and ethnology, are contributing to the discussion
* A diverse set of backgrounds can lead to confusion, but also excitement and new ideas

**The Conference on Consciousness in Tucson, 1994**
* Organized by an anesthesiologist, psychologist, and applied mathematician
+ Aimed to provide a forum for diverse opinions and approaches
* The conference attracted over 300 participants from around the world
+ Scientists, philosophers, journalists, and others engaged in vigorous discussions
+ Documented in scientific publications and conference proceedings

**Unsolved Issues Surrounding Consciousness**
* No consensus on the ontological basis of consciousness:
+ Is it based on a non-physical aspect of reality?
+ Or does it emerge from electrochemical interactions in the brain?
* Questions raised during the conference include:
+ How do traditional neuroscience and neural network theory address qualia or the nature of experience?
+ Why does the brain need an inner life, rather than just being a mechanism?
+ What are the neural correlates of consciousness, and how can they be determined?
+ How is conscious attention, vision, language, and memory mediated?
+ What is the relation between consciousness and time?
* Possible contributions of quantum theory to understanding consciousness:
+ As a physical theory more mysterious than consciousness itself
+ Potential experimental evidence for the role of quantum effects in the mind
+ Building bridges between seemingly unrelated areas of scientific inquiry into the nature of consciousness
+ Better learning from each other through collaboration and exchange of ideas.

## I Philosophy of Mind

**Philosophy of Mind: Introduction**
- Modern interest in consciousness fueled by advances in neuroscience and computers
- Stark choice between dualism (mind is distinct from brain) and reductionism (no mind, just brain processes)
- William James suggested seeking common elements among mental facts instead of a common cause

**Challenges in Understanding Consciousness**
- Hard problems: subjective experience, inner life
- Reductionist science struggles to explain these aspects
- Chalmers' double-aspect theory proposes information as both physical and experiential

**Consciousness: Introspective vs. Higher Order Awareness**
- Introspective consciousness: perception of one's own mind (Locke)
- Giizeldere distinguishes introspection from higher order thought, both connected by an "introspective link"

**Experiential Aspects of Consciousness: Qualia and Monism**
- Stubenberg sees qualia as underlying entity giving rise to both physical and mental
- Russell's neutral monism: common underlying reality for all phenomena

**The Binding Problem: Unifying Perceptual Experiences**
- Hardcastle examines neurobiological solutions, finds current methods insufficient
- Critiques evidence for 40 Hz oscillatory cortical firing patterns as mechanism for unifying perceptual experiences

**Philosophy of Mind: Significance and Paradoxes**
- Flanagan's naturalistic stance: dreams are mere epiphenomena, not representations of subconscious processes
- Reductionist/dualist paradox: the closer we look at the brain, the more enigmatic consciousness becomes.

### 1 Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness

**Consciousness: Easy vs. Hard Problems**

**Introduction:**
- Ambiguous term with various phenomena associated
- Easy problems: directly susceptible to standard methods of cognitive science
  - Phenomena easily explained through computational or neural mechanisms

**Easy Problems of Consciousness**
- Ability to discriminate, categorize, react to environmental stimuli
- Integration of information by a cognitive system
- Reportability of mental states
- Accessing internal states
- Focus of attention
- Deliberate control of behavior
- Wakefulness vs. sleep

**Hard Problem of Consciousness:**
- Experience: subjective aspect of consciousness
  - Something it is like to be a conscious organism (Nagel, 1974)
- Organisms are subjects of experience
- Perplexing question: why do cognitive systems result in various experiences?
- Physical processing gives rise to rich inner life but no good explanation on how.

**Progress:**
- Clear idea on explaining easy problems through cognitive science and neuroscience methods
- Difficulty lies within hard problem
  - Intractable problem for some, no good explanation yet

**Approach:**
1. Isolate the truly hard part of consciousness problem
2. Critique recent work using reductive methods to address consciousness
3. Argue that nonreductive explanation is needed for further progress
4. Propose a naturalistic account based on principles of structural coherence and organizational invariance, as well as double-aspect theory of information.

#### Functional Explanation in Cognitive Science Perception Memory and Language

**Phenomenon of Consciousness**
- Central problem: What is "consciousness" and why is it unreasonable that it exists?
- Definitions:
  - Organism is conscious if there's something it's like to be that organism
  - Mental state is conscious if there's something it's like to be in that state
  - Other terms: phenomenal consciousness, qualia, experience
- Importance: Experiences cannot be objectively measured or described; subjectivity is intangible and ineffable.

**Ambiguity of Consciousness Terminology**
- Philosophers and scientists use "consciousness" ambiguously
  - Hard problem vs. easy problems
    * Hard problem: Problem of experience, the nature of consciousness
    * Easy problems: Explanation of cognitive functions (reportability, introspection access, integration)

**Explanation of Functions vs. Consciousness**
- Easy problems: Explication of mechanisms performing cognitive functions
  - Neurophysiological and cognitive modeling are suitable for this
- Hard problem: Explaining consciousness itself
  - Persists even after explaining function performance (reportability, internal access, integration)
- Function definition: Ability to perform tasks that facilitate behavior

**Reductive Explanation in Science**
- Genes: Specifying mechanism storing and transmitting hereditary information
- Life: Explaining reproduction, adaptation, metabolism (functions related to life)
- Learning: Modification of behavioral capacities based on environmental info
  - Perception, memory, language can be explained similarly by explaining function performance.

---

#### Hard Problem of Consciousness Unresolved Explanatory Gap

**The Problem of Consciousness**
- **Hard problem**: Why is the performance of cognitive and behavioral functions accompanied by experience?
- There's an explanatory gap between the functions and experience, which needs to be bridged.
- The usual explanatory methods of cognitive science and neuroscience don't suffice for addressing the hard problem of consciousness.

**Examples of Studies on Consciousness**
1. **Neurobiological Theory of Consciousness**: Crick and Koch (1990, 1994) proposed that certain 35-75 Hz neural oscillations in the cerebral cortex are the basis of consciousness.
   - Explanation: These oscillations seem to be correlated with awareness and suggest a mechanism for binding information contents together.
   - Limitations: The theory does not explain why the oscillations give rise to experience, only how they might facilitate binding and storage in memory.
2. Interview with Koch (published) stated that Crick and Koch's theory aims to understand the neurobiology of consciousness but doesn't claim to solve the hard problem.

---

#### Cognitive Perspectives on Consciousness Unanswered Questions

**Theories of Visual Awareness:**
- Difficulty distinguishing subjective feelings from materialistic level (molecules and neurons)
- Easier to study: visual awareness (awareness of surroundings, ability to respond in meaningful ways)

**Baars's Global Workspace Theory:**
- Contents of consciousness in a global workspace, acting as a communal blackboard for system access
- Addresses cognitive psychology aspects such as accessibility and informational integration
- Unclear why information within the global workspace is experienced
- Bridging question: why does global accessibility give rise to conscious experience?

**Approaches to Consciousness:**
1. Explain something else (address easier problems like reportability or self-concept)
   - Worthwhile but unambitious in the context of research on consciousness
2. Deny the phenomenon
   - Experience exists only if equated with capacity to discriminate and report
   - Unsatisfactory as experience is central and manifest aspect of mental lives
3. Claim to explain experience fully (wish to take experience seriously)
   - Relevant step in explanation often passed over quickly, ending up looking like magic
- Strategies vary among researchers

**Chalmers's Critique:**
- Recent cognitive or neuroscientific approaches to consciousness face criticism for not addressing the problem of conscious experience itself
- Examples: Edelman's neural Darwinism model, Dennett's multiple drafts model, Jackendoff's intermediate level theory
- Researchers have different attitudes towards the problem of experience and sometimes take a clear stand.

---

#### The Quest for the Extra Ingredient in Consciousness Explanation

**Approaches to Explaining Conscious Experience**

**Taken for Granted Approach**:
- Assumes experience is a given, but provides incomplete explanation

**Accounting for Structure of Experience Approach**:
- Accounts for certain structural relations between experiences and sensory processing
- Plausible but limited, as it does not explain the existence of experience itself

**Identifying Substrate of Experience Approach**:
- Isolates brain processes that give rise to experience
- Provides indirect light on the problem of consciousness, but incomplete without explanation for why and how

**Extra Ingredient Approach**:
- Requires an additional "ingredient" to fully account for conscious experience
- Proposed extra ingredients include: nonalgorithmic processing, nonlinear dynamics, neurophysiology discoveries, and quantum mechanics
- However, these approaches do not provide a complete explanation of why experience arises from these processes

---

#### Beyond Reductive Explanations for Consciousness

**The Problem of Consciousness: Experience Cannot Be Explained by Physical Processes Alone**

**Background:**
- Physical processes alone cannot explain experience due to its emergence from the physical world
- Reductive methods, which explain a phenomenon in terms of more basic physical processes, are successful for structures and functions but fail for experience

**Reasons for Failure of Reductive Methods in Explaining Experience:**
1. Conceptual coherence: It is possible that any given process could exist without experience.
2. Physical theory does not entail the facts about experience: Experience is not an automatic consequence of physical processes as it goes beyond what can be derived from them.
3. Limitations of reductive methods: They work well in most domains because they explain structures and functions, but they fail when it comes to explaining phenomena beyond this scope.

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. Nonreductive explanation: Taking fundamental entities as basic and giving a theory of how they relate to everything else in the world; expanding the ontology of physics to account for new components like electromagnetic charge and forces.
2. Further investigation: Continuing to explore alternative methods when simple ones fail, as the problem is considered interesting rather than unsolvable.

---

#### Towards a Theory of Consciousness Fundamental Entities and Basic Laws

**Physical Theory and Fundamental Concepts:**
* Physical theory takes mass and space-time as fundamental but does not explain them further
* Experiment is suggested to be a fundamental feature of the world alongside mass, charge, and space-time
* Taking experience as fundamental allows for constructing a theory of experience with new principles
* Nonreductive theory adds psychophysical principles that do not interfere with physical laws but explain how experience arises from physical processes
* Naturalistic dualism: expands the ontology slightly while maintaining a naturalistic view of the world

**Fundamental Theories and Their Similarities:**
* Fundamental theories, including physics and future theory of consciousness, involve fundamental principles
* These theories aim for simplicity, elegance, and beauty in their explanation of basic furniture of the world.

**Challenges with Physical Explanations:**
* Experience cannot be derived from physical laws alone
* Adding new bridging principles is necessary to explain how experience arises from physical processes
* Some philosophers argue that there may not be a metaphysical gap between physical processes and experience but still concede an explanatory gap.

**Towards a Theory of Consciousness:**
* Understanding the relationship between physical processess and experience, as well as their regularities, is important for developing a theory of consciousness.

---

#### Structural Coherence Principle in Consciousness Theory

**Reductive Explanation and Consciousness Theory**
- Reductive explanation limits initial pieces in developing nonreductive theory of consciousness
- Lack of objective data on consciousness is a problem, but personal experience and indirect sources provide data
- Philosophical analysis, thought experiments, simplicity, homogeneity etc., used to evaluate theories
- Ultimate theory will be compatible with available data and follow nonempirical constraints

**Data Collection for Consciousness Theory**
- Personal experience as rich source of data on relationships between physical processes and consciousness
- Indirect sources: verbal reports from subjects, observable cases
- Limitations in methods, but sufficient to get theory off the ground

**Principles Relating Consciousness and Cognition**
- Philosophical analysis yields principles constraining shape of ultimate theory
- Importance of systematizing information, extending it, making inferences to simplest possible theory
- Theories retain element of speculation due to impossibility of intersubjective experimental tests

**Psychophysical Principles in a Theory of Consciousness**
- Consist of principles connecting physical processes and properties of experience
- Encapsulate way experience arises from the physical
- Goal: tell which systems have experiences, identify relevant physical properties for emergence of experience

**Principle of Structural Coherence**
- Coherence between structure of consciousness and awareness
- Awareness as direct availability for global control
- Correspondence between consciousness and awareness
- Central fact: complex structure in both conscious experience and awareness
- Each structural feature in experience has a corresponding feature in the information processing structure of awareness.

---

#### The Structural Coherence Principle in Consciousness and Awareness

**Principle of Structural Coherence**

**Overview:**
- Principle that relates structural properties of consciousness to processing considerations
- Cognitive processes do not entail conscious experience but cohere intimately
- Useful for indirect explanation of consciousness in terms of physical processes

**Application:**
- Color experiences and their corresponding distinctions have a three-dimensional space representation (hue, saturation, intensity)
  - Visual processing system analyzes waveforms of light along three axes
  - Corresponds to fine-grained structure of visual field
- Other sensory and nonsensory experiences also follow this principle

**Limits:**
- Does not capture nonstructural properties of experience (intrinsic nature of a sensation)
- Cannot explain all properties, but provides constraints on psychophysical connection

**Implications:**
- Structural coherence allows for indirect explanation of consciousness using physical processes
  - Existing work in neuroscience aimed at isolating neural correlates of consciousness can be interpreted through this principle.

---

#### Basic Principle of Information as Foundation for Consciousness

**Coherence Principle and Awareness Mechanisms**

**Coherence Principle**:
- Mechanisms of awareness are hypotheses about mechanisms that perform the function of making information directly available for global control
- Coherent with consciousness, as a mechanism of awareness is a correlate of conscious experience
- Empirical question to determine which brain processes explain global availability

**Organizational Invariance Principle**:
- Conscious experiences arise from the abstract pattern of causal interaction between system components, not just the physical makeup
- Controversial principle; some argue consciousness is tied to specific biology
- Thought experiment illustration: Two functionally isomorphic systems with different experiences
  - Gradually transforming one into the other reveals a spectrum of intermediate cases
  - Two systems A and B differ in less than 10% of physical makeup, but have significantly different experiences
  - Flipping a switch between identical neural circuits in A and silicon circuit in B results in change without notice by system
- Contradicts the assumption that changes in experience are unnoticed, making it an impractical hypothesis

**Fundamental Principle Needed**:
- More basic principles required to explain conscious experiences based on the above constraints
- Proposed principle involves information and Shannon's notion of information states embedded in an information space.

---

#### Information-Based Consciousness Theory

**The Double-Aspect Principle of Consciousness**

**Background:**
- Direct isomorphism between certain physical and phenomenal information spaces
- Observations lead to conclusion: any two functionally isomorphic systems have the same conscious experience
- Philosophical hypotheses of "absent qualia" and "inverted qualia" are empirically impossible

**Implications:**
1. **Physical Properties**: Relevant for emergence of experience = organizational properties
2. **Constraint on Theory of Consciousness**
3. **Principle of Structural Coherence**: Explained by information structure within information spaces
4. **Role in Fundamental Theory of Consciousness:**
   - Information as fundamental to physics (It from Bit doctrine)
   - Two aspects: physical and phenomenal

**Speculative Nature:**
- Extremely speculative theory
- Unanswered questions: What type of information has a phenomenal aspect?
- Possibilities: All information may have a phenomenal aspect or experience is more widespread than believed.

**Progress and Future Work:**
- Further investigation needed for explanatory success
- More refined theories and careful analysis required.

---

#### Consciousness Intrinsic Properties and Information Processing

**The Hard Problem of Consciousness**

**The Problem**:
- Chalmers argues that experience is a fundamental property, but how it arises from information processing remains unclear
- Some believe that simpler organisms may only experience occasionally or not at all

**Possible Solutions**:
- **Thermostat as an example**: If experience is fundamental, it should be present consistently, not just occasionally
- **Information and phenomenal properties**: Allowing that intrinsic properties exist, the intrinsic properties of physical entities could be phenomenal properties

**Metaphysical Speculation**:
- Physics characterizes basic entities only extrinsically, leaving the intrinsic nature aside
- Intrinsic properties may be phenomenal, answering concerns about causal relevance of experience in a world where physical domain is causally closed

**Arguments Against**:
- Best ignored for developing scientific theory

### 2 Consciousness and the Introspective Link Principle

**Consciousness as Awareness of Mental States: The Introspective Link Principle**

**Intuition about Consciousness:**
- Dates back several centuries
- Not an ordinary mental state or process itself
- Consists in the awareness of such states and processes (Locke's maxim)
  - Perception of what passes in one's mind

**Philosophers and Psychologists:**
- William James to Franz Brentano
- David Armstrong, Paul Churchland, Daniel Dennett, etc.

**Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness:**
- Representing of lower-level mental states and processes
- Perception-like (Armstrong, Churchland, Lycan) or thought-like (Rosenthal, Carruthers, Dennett)

**Dilemma for Higher-Order Perception Theories:**
1. Commitment to intentional fallacy
   - Properties of what's represented vs properties of representer
2. Transformation into higher-order thought theories

**Two Senses of Consciousness:**
- Individual consciousness (being awake, alert)
- State consciousness (classifying mental states as conscious or not)

**Introspective Link Principle:**
- Investigating the relation between individual and state consciousness

**Domain of Objects for Individual Consciousness:**
- Physical things, abstract objects, facts, states of affairs, events
  - External objects (accessible by others)
- Proprioceptive states, mental states (internal)

**Distinction Between Senses of Consciousness:**
- Individual consciousness: overall state one is in
- State consciousness: classifying mental states as conscious or not.

---

#### Higher-Order Perception Theories and Mental Representation

**Higher-Order Representation (HOR) Theories of Consciousness**

**The Introspective Link Principle**:
- A mental state M in a subject 5 is a "state-conscious" state if and only if 5 is "individual-conscious" of M.
- This principle underlies both the perception-like and thought-like higher-order theories of consciousness.
- It implies that consciousness involves a "mental state, M', in 5, directed upon M", which "endows M with state-consciousness".

**The Higher-Order Perception (HOP) Thesis**:
- According to HOP theorists, 5's consciousness consists of their "perception" or "monitoring" of their first-order mental state V.
- This would be a "second-order 'perception-like awareness'" of V.

**Critique of HOP Theories**:
- The author argues that the nature of this "perception-like awareness" is ambiguous, and there is little attention paid to detailing it.
- They argue that the plausibility of the HOP theories depends on providing such details.

---

#### Higher-Order Perception Awareness of Mental State Representations

**Higher-Order Perception (HOP) vs Higher-Order Thought (HOT)**
* Differences in Awareness Levels
+ HOP: Direct awareness of mental states qua carriers of content vs. their representation or what they represent.
+ Two readings for HOP:
- Option 1 (Collapsing Double-Nested Structure): Not an option as it eliminates higher-order representing and introspection.
- Option 2 (Awareness of Having a Mental State): Similar to HOT, but not an option for HOP account independent of HOT.
* Materialist Theories of Mental Representations
+ Contemporary theories: Neuronal structures that represent objects and facts in the subject's environment or bodily states.
+ Properties of representers vs. represented often differ significantly.
* Resemblance Theory of Mental Representation (implicitly embraced by some HOP theorists)
+ Claim: Ideas in mind resemble objects in the external world.
+ Contrasts with contemporary materialist theories.
* Churchland's Position on Human Subjective Consciousness and Direct Introspection of Brain States
+ Materialist position oscillating between eliminativism and reductionism.
+ Promissory note for direct introspection of brain states via properties such as spike frequencies, serotonin secretions, etc.
+ Conflation of properties of representer (brain states) with those of the represented (mental states).
+ Indirect access to one's brain states through technologies like MRI images doesn't provide complete understanding of mental states.

#### Intentional Fallacy and Perception in Consciousness Debate

**Higher-Order Theories (HOP) of Consciousness:**
* HOP theorists face a dilemma: commit to "intentional fallacy" or give up HOP account altogether
* Option 3 in HOP presents a conflation of properties of representations and represented items, leading to problematic interpretations
* Crossroads for HOP theorists: embrace "intentional fallacy," opt for unilevel theory, or accept HOT interpretation

**Four Readings of HOP:**
1. **Option 1**: Perception as awareness of current mental states (Locke's perspective)
2. **Option 2**: Higher-order thought as consciousness (Armstrong and Lycan's view)
3. **Option 3A**: Visual perception forms a representation in the mind, which is then perceived again (mind's eye model) - commits to "intentional fallacy"
4. **Option 3B**: Resemblance theory of mental representations, involving conflation of properties of representer and represented items - also commits to "intentional fallacy"

**Problems with HOP:**
- Lack of analysis for perceiving what passes in one's own mind
- Theoretical backbone questionable due to definitional issues and conflicting interpretations among proponents.

### 3 The Place of Qualia in the World of Science

**Introduction:**
- Difficulty of understanding qualitative consciousness
- Assumptions about color qualia: monadic, simple, homogeneous, irreducible, neutral
- Account of qualitative consciousness compatible with science if qualia are compatible with it

**Question at Hand:**
- Is the existence of color qualia compatible with science?

**Three Answers to the Nature of Science:**
1. **Minimal Interpretation**: Limited to experiences; no place for qualia in scientific discourse
2. **Scientific Elimination of Qualia**: Color qualia are not real properties, only an illusion or convention
3. **Physicalism**: All entities and properties studied by physics or other natural sciences; respect for physics does not imply physicalism

**Physics vs Physicalism:**
- Distinction between physics and physicalism: Physics is a scientific discipline, while physicalism is a philosophical stance
- Physicalism asserts that only physically studied entities, properties, relations, and facts are real
- Respect for science does not commit one to physicalism.

---

#### Non-Reductive Physicalism A Critique

**Physicalism vs. Qualia**

**The Principle of Scientific Realism (PSR)**
- The difference between scientific attitude and physicalism
- Physicalism makes PSR a condition for truth, leading to confusion with its claims
- Answer No. 2 supports this union, while Answer No. 3 severs it

**Physicalism Without Eliminativism: Strategies to Make Qualia Respectable**
1. Reductive physicalism: attempt to reduce qualia to physicalistically respectable properties
   - Qualia are irreducible by assumption
   - Unsuccessful due to its record in the past
2. Nonreductive physicalism: show that qualia depend on physical properties without threatening physics' hegemony
   - Many forms exist but all have problems explaining how qualia get instantiated
   - Criticized for being obscurantist by Schiffer and Kim, a lapsed nonreductive physicalist
3. Eliminativism not obligatory for physicalists
4. Stubenberg's view: Qualia exist in the world of science without entailing PSR

**Compatibilism**
- Combines unwavering descriptive realism about science with awareness that it may not be exclusive or exhaustive
- Allows coherent conjoining of respect for science and belief in irreducible color qualia

**Critique of the Simple View**
1. Illusions, hallucinations, dreams, perceptual relativity make it challenging to place qualia on an object's surface
2. Causal facts involved in perception argue against viewing experienced qualia as part of the object rather than the mind/brain (Russell's argument)
3. Other objections: difficulties with subjectivity, the role of consciousness, and more complex scenarios.

---

#### Primacy of Qualia Neutral Monism

**Problems with the Simple View on Qualia**
- **First Problem**: Qualia do not jump back to their starting point like a stretched rope (Russell, 1954)
- **Second Problem**: If qualia are explained scientifically, they become epistemically superfluous and inaccessible (implicitly referring to Feigl & Sellars' "The Nature of Perceptual Involvement")
- **Third Problem**: Qualia play no causal role in perception or anything else; they are mere epiphenomena, which many philosophers find anathema.
- **Fourth Problem**: Current science does not assign a causal role to qualia, so acknowledging causally active qualia would require rejecting current science (implicitly referring to Jackson's "Epiphenomenal Qualia")
- **Fifth Problem**: Scientific laws connecting qualia and other properties pose problems for the scientific view of the world.
- **Sixth Problem**: Sellars' grain problem - how discrete, colorless scientific objects can instantiate homogeneous phenomenal color properties (Broad, 1969).

**Biological Naturalism as an Alternative to Simple View**
- John Searle's proposal: Color qualia are natural and compatible with descriptive realism.
- Physical and phenomenal properties can be instantiated by the same physical object (the brain) without problem, similar to how water instantiates both microphysical and liquidity properties.

**Neutral Monism as an Alternative to Simple View**
- This approach places qualia at the basis and treats nonqualitative properties as constructed or derivative from them.
- It inverts the order of fundamentalness by treating qualia as more fundamental than scientific properties.

---

#### Neutral Monism and Qualia Integration in Science

**Neutral Monism and Phenomenalism**

**Acceptance of Neutral Monism**:
- Accepted by Berkeley, later phenomenologists, and neutral monists (e.g., Hume, James, Mach, Russell, Ayer)
- Distinguished from phenomenalism through unending discussions on details and differences between various versions of neutral monism

**Russell's Neutral Monism**:
- Recognizes a single basic category
- Elements are not material or mental
- Basic elements: events, paradigms of which are percepts (phenomenal properties/qualia)
  - Percepts located in the head, not on external objects
- Events constitute physical world, including macroscopic and microscopic particles

**Descriptive Realism**:
- Science accurately describes the real world
- Compatible with neutral monism

**Scientific Realism vs. Neutral Monism**:
- "Scientific realism" refers to descriptive realism
- Neutral monism is a speculative pointer towards integrating qualia into the scientific world, not a comprehensive solution

### 4 The Binding Problem and Neurobiological Oscillations

**The Binding Problem and Neurobiological Oscillations**

**Background:**
- Brain processes visual data in specialized areas (interblob, intralaminar pathway, magnocellular stream)
- Conscious experiences are unified despite segregated processing
- Lack of multimodal association areas raises question of how features come together

**Binding Problem**:
- How do brains link outputs from different processing modules into unified percepts?
- No simple solution, as brain is not a central cortical informational exchange

**Perception in Psychology and Neuroscience:**
- Extract constant features, construct temporary representations before associating with meaning
- Lack of association areas creates difficulty understanding neurophysiological underpinnings of perception

**Parallel Distributed Processing**:
- Coactivation conundrum: Multiple symbols becoming active at once result in loss of information
- Fodor and Pylyshyn argue parallel architecture is lower-level implementation of discrete symbol manipulating device

**Solution Attempts:**
- Segregate cell assemblies into distinct areas to allow for interaction between areas
- But this solution limits flexibility and requires heavy burden on phylogenetic development or genetic organization.

**Binding Problem Remains Unsolved**:
- Ongoing research explores neuronal events related to perceptual experiences, such as 40Hz oscillatory firing patterns in cortex (Blakeslee 1992, Crick and Koch 1990, Flanagan 1992, Koch 1992)
- However, researchers are making a mistake assuming 40Hz oscillations may be related to perceptual awareness.

---

#### Neuronal Assembly Synchronization in Visual Processing

**The Binding Problem in Neurobiology**

**Background:**
- Rapid conceptual learning requires more than physical connections between neurons
- Brain development and time scale are important factors

**Problem with Physical Connections:**
- Too slow to support rapid conceptual learning
- Limitations in understanding single cell behavior
- Need for studying larger populations of cells

**Advancements in Studying Neuron Populations:**
- Multiple simultaneous recordings from single cells
- Multiple-channel electroencephalograph recordings

**New Approaches to Address Binding Problem:**
- Synchronized oscillations in neural assemblies
  - Operate at a frequency between 40 and 80 Hz (gamma range)
  - Occur in all three types of recordings: single unit activity, multiple unit activity, local slow wave field potentials
  - May serve as a general mechanism for linking features of visual scenes together

**Eckhorn's Research:**
- Synchronized neuronal assemblies in different brain areas with similar receptive fields synchronize outputs through oscillatory state for simple stimuli.

---

#### Neurobiological Oscillations and Binding Mechanism in the Primary Visual Cortex Synchronized Firing Patterns for Object Recognition

**Neural Assemblies and Oscillations**

**Similar Receptive Fields**:
- Neural assemblies with similar receptive fields synchronize their outputs
- Spatially contiguous, non-similar receptive field assemblies do not

**Oscillation Mechanism**:
- Oscillations in Area 17 (primary visual cortex) are due to:
  - Intrinsic membrane properties of presynaptic cells (minimal effect)
  - Oscillations in thalamic input
  - Intracortical feedback pathways
- Rhythmic synaptic input from the thalamus leads to oscillatory behavior

**Synchronization in Area V4**:
- Dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus shows no general synchronized oscillation pattern in the gamma range, suggesting cortical phenomena alone
- Synchronous oscillations are strongly suggested to be cortical phenomena
- Phase-locked synchronization across spatially separate columns for cells with similar orientation preferences is influenced by global properties of the stimulus

**Implications and Future Research**:
- Synchronized oscillations may serve to represent higher-order features in a pattern, such as figure-ground segregation
- "Resonances are a general phenomenon, forming the basis of a correlation code which is used within and between different sensory systems and perhaps even throughout the entire brain"
- Higher-level comparator mechanisms, such as central feature locators or distributed recurrent feedback loops, may play a fundamental role in initial synchronization and dynamic stability of oscillations
- Phase-locked oscillations are being taken seriously as a new solution to the superposition catastrophe and binding problem

---

#### Feature Segmentation and Binding Mechanisms in Visual Perception

**Neuroscientists' Model of Mental Function**

**Early Stages in Visual System**:
- Dedicated to parsing incoming retinal pattern into cohesive features
- Neurons with differential response properties and connections can carry out required computations
- Brain must actively segment incoming data to maintain constant perception across disruptive events

**Binding**:
- Hypothesis provides answer to psychology's binding problem
- Conjectural to Triesman's hypothesis of a master map and Prinzmetal's Object Hypothesis
- Involves segmentation, object recognition, and association with memories

**Segmentation vs. Binding**:
- Eckhorn et al. indexed segmentation, not binding
- Gray and Singer found phase-locked synchrony only between neurons sensitive to same feature
- Limitations in current technology hinder definitive testing of oscillation hypothesis as a binding mechanism

**Neurobiological Oscillations**:
- Results extended to area 17 and PMLS, visual association areas specialized for motion
- Stimulus-induced nonoscillatory synchronization may be more fundamental for feature binding
- Synchronous oscillations cannot be sufficient for feature binding, but may still be necessary

### 5 Deconstructing Dreams The Spandrels of Sleep

**Philosophical Problems about Dreams**

**Three Famous Philosophical Problems**:
- **How can I be sure I am not always dreaming? (Descartes' problem)**
- **Can I be immoral in dreams? (Augustine's problem)**
- **Are dreams experiences or just reports of experiences we think we had while sleeping? (20th century problem)**

**Solutions to the First Three Problems**:
1. You can be confident you are not always dreaming.
2. Committing sinful acts in dreams is not sinful, as Augustine's theory suggests.
3. Dreams are experiences that occur during sleep.

**The Fourth Problem: Is Dreaming Functional?**
- **Answer**: The phenomenal mentation that occurs during sleep can be seen as a byproduct of the system designed for sleep and the sleep cycle, rather than a functional adaptation.

**Constructive Naturalism and the Natural Method**
1. Consciousness has depth and hidden structure, beyond its phenomenal surface.
2. Consciousness is heterogeneous in kind, with different aspects (phenomenal and neural).
3. The "natural method" of understanding consciousness involves integrating phenomenology, psychology, and neuroscience.

---

#### Exploring the Epiphenomenal Nature and Interpretability of Dreams

**Evolutionary Biology and Consciousness**
- Understanding consciousness through evolutionary perspective: biological and cultural
- Different forms of consciousness based on ecological niches
- Role of drift, adaptive selection, and free-riding in shaping consciousness

**Phenomenal vs. Evolutionary Perspective on Dreams**
- P-dreaming as a nonfunctional byproduct of brain function during sleep (epiphenomenon)
- P-dreams reveal information for self-understanding despite being evolutionary epiphenomena

**Dreams and Sleep Stages**
- Mentation occurs in both NREM and REM sleep, referred to as "dreams"
- Night terrors, sleepwalking, and tooth-grinding are NREM phenomena
- Child's behavior during night terrors suggests being in stage III or IV NREM sleep
- Confusion between dreaming and REM sleep: some identify dreaming with REM only.

**Distinction Between Perceptual Consciousness and P-Dreaming**
- Perseverative fearful thought occurring during NREM sleep is a type of p-dreaming but not the same as awake perception consciousness.

---

#### REM Sleep Origins and PGO Waves

**Dream Research and Terminology Debate**

**Background:**
- Folk psychological usage of "dream" contrasts with scientific definitions
- Harvard's Hobson group defines dreams as bizarre, fantastic mentation during REM sleep
- Natural method used to make principled distinctions but not precise

**Questions a Good Theory of Sleep and Dreams Should Address:**
1. Why do p-dreams involve shutdowns of attentional, motor, memory systems?
2. What functions does sleep serve, how does clocklike cycling contribute?
3. How do phenomenology of non-REM and REM mentation differ?

**Answers:**
1. Sleep controlled by a clock in suprachiasmatic nucleus (hypothalamus) and a second clock in the pons (pons brainstem).
2. REM sleep: PGO waves originate from brainstem, reach lateral geniculate body (thalamus) and occipital cortex, facilitating visual imagery.
3. Convergence of neuroscientific and phenomenological data explains vivid, bizarre mentation during REM sleep.
4. Inhibited motor output in REM sleep due to hyperpolarizing signals from brainstem neurons to spinal cord.
5. Recent studies show mentation during dreaming operates on the same anatomical substrate as perception in waking state.
6. PGO waves dominant during REM sleep, quiescent during NREM sleep.

#### Brain Chemical Shifts in REM Sleep for Neurotransmitter Restoration

**Sleep Functions: REM vs NREM Sleep**

**Brainstem Lesions**:
- People with certain brainstem lesions exhibit REM sleep behaviors, such as "playing linebacker to their dresser"
- This suggests the role of REM sleep in various functions

**Distinguishing REM and NREM Sleep**:
- REM vs. NREM sleep have different mental states and functions
- REM sleep is more frequent during development, especially infancy
- REM sleep decreases as we age, while NREM sleep becomes more dominant
- Hypothesis: NREM sleep serves restorative and energy conservation functions

**Functions of Sleep**:
- Over 50 distinct functions attributed to sleep and dreams in the last decade
- REM and NREM sleep likely serve different functions

**Restorative Processes in Sleep**:
- Endocrine system readjusts levels during sleep, including testosterone and pituitary growth hormone
- Protein synthesis occurs at higher rates during sleep, aiding tissue repair and growth
- Food metabolic rate is reduced to conserve energy

**REM Sleep Functions**:
- Large percentage of REMing in development suggests it helps build brain connections, particularly visual system
- Infants spend more time in REM sleep than adolescents, suggesting a role in releasing unconscious desires
- Neurochemical shifts during REM sleep may allow the brain to rest and synthesize new neurotransmitters for attention, memory, and learning.

---

#### The Neurochemical Landscape of Sleep Cycles

**Theories of Sleep Functions**

**Changes in Brain Activity During Sleep Stages:**
- Coordinated changes occur in EEG signals, neurotransmitter levels, posture, and mental activity as we transition between waking, NREM sleep, and REM sleep.
- Posture shifts during REM sleep.
- Perceptions of reality shift from vivid to thoughtlike nonvisual cognition in NREM sleep and then to bizarre visual imagery in dreams.

**Hypothesized Functions of Sleep:**
1. **Neurotransmitter Storage and Maintenance**: Neurons are active during waking, with high levels of both aminergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters. In NREM sleep, balance is retained but levels decline, affecting alertness. During REM sleep, there's a radical shift in chemical balance as aminergic neurotransmitter levels plummet while cholinergic neurotransmitter levels rise again to waking levels. These changes affect the unique features of dreaming, such as illogical explanations and poor recall.
2. **Memory Consolidation**: A hypothesis suggests that during sleep, memories are converted from electrical patterns into stable protein structures within neurons, particularly at synapses. This reactivation process occurs during REM sleep when cholinergic neurons interact with temporary electrical synaptic hot spots to create more permanent memories.
3. **Adaptive Significance of Sleep**: The biological notion of an adaptation refers to features that increase fitness and result from selective pressures contributing to reproductive success. Sleep, including NREM and REM sleep, is proposed as an adaptation due to its restoration, conservation, and building functions. However, the adaptive significance of specific mental aspects of sleep (thoughts during NREM and dreams/lucid dreams in REM) remains unclear. They might be serendipitous accompaniments or nonadaptations if they don't undergo positive selection or modification pressures.
4. **Function vs. Causal Contribution**: The term 'function' has multiple meanings: (1) a causal contribution sense of function and (2) functional versus dysfunctional sense. Mutant DNA causing tumor growth is an example of something functioning in the causal contribution sense but being dysfunctional biologically and psychologically for the organism. Sleep, as an adaptation, refers to its role in contributing to reproductive success through specific functions like restoration, conservation, and building processes.

#### The Function of Dreaming A Debate on Epiphenomenalism

**Dreaming: A Biological Phenomenon**

**Pleiotropic Nature of Dreaming**:
- Automatic sequelae, a spandrel (an incidental result)
- Uncertain if dream-consciousness was subjected to positive selection pressures and modification

**Brainstem Activation in Infancy**:
- Brainstem is designed to activate visual system during infancy to build it
- Continued activation of visual system serves no further developmental function

**PGO Waves in REM Sleep**:
- Causally implicated in neurochemical stockpiling (serotonin, norepinephrine, etc.) for memory stabilization
- No reason to believe PGO waves require mentation for these processes

**Lack of Relevance between Mentation and Processes**:
- People remember nonsensical syllables better after sleep without reporting dreaming about them
- Students don't report dreams related to mathematical proofs or geometry
- Proof of Pythagorean theorem unlikely to occur in dreams

**Epiphenomenalist Suspicion and P-Dreaming**:
- Contrasted with adaptive phenomenal awareness in vision
- Phenomenal aspects associated with sleeping are nonadaptations

**Function of P-Dreaming**:
- Derivative psychological function constructed through cultural imagination
- Dream content sheds light on mental life, well-being, and identity

**Differences between REM Mentation and Awake Mentation**:
- Neuroscientifically and phenomenologically different state
- Cortex tries to fit REM mentation into narrative structures about personal experiences

---

#### Dreams as Mental Spandrels Exploring the Function and Interpretation of Dreams

**Deconstructing Dreams: The Spandrels of Sleep**

**Dreams as Expressions of the Mind**:
- Dreams express what's on one's mind
- Phenomenal dreams can affect mood and inspire creative projects upon waking
- Dreams are a "serendipitous mentation" produced by the cortex working with noise from below

**The Role of Dreams in Self-Knowledge**:
- Dreams are "identity-expressive" and contribute to self-knowledge
- The project of self-knowledge is important enough that we use dreams as a starting point
- Dreams serve as "spandrels" - beautiful accompaniments to the design of consciousness

**The Prevalence of Romantic or Sexual Content in Dreams**:
- After hormonal changes in adolescence, only about 6 in 100 dreams have romantic/sexual content

---

#### Exploring Neuroscience and Consciousness in Dreams 40-Hz Oscillations and REM Sleep

**The Mind-Body Problem and Consciousness**

**McGinn's Perspective**:
- Can we solve the mind-body problem?
- Dreams serve as an example: Even dreamers acknowledge their experiences, despite potential doubts about their reality

**Biological Constraints in Theory**:
- Cognitive information processing models often fail to attend to biological realism
- Knowledge of brain is thin and interpretation is difficult
- Antidepressants affect dopamine, serotonin levels, absorption rates, etc., but understanding their mechanisms is limited

**40-Hz Oscillations in Consciousness**:
- Crick and Koch suggested subjective awareness is linked to 40-Hz oscillation patterns in relevant neurons
- 40-Hz oscillations found in various parts of the brain, including during REM sleep
- During dreaming, 40-Hz oscillations are not reset by sensory input, suggesting a "hyperattentiveness" that blocks external stimuli

**Theoretical Significance**:
- The neuroscientific data push theory in certain directions, opening new questions
- Possible future research: Determining if 40-Hz oscillations are necessary or sufficient for experience, differentiating various types of experiences

**Limitations of the 40-Hz Necessary Condition Hypothesis**:
- Mentation during NREM sleep does not always involve 40-Hz oscillations, despite mentation occurring

---

#### Dreams Nature Function and Interpretation

**Thalamocortical Oscillations in Sleeping and Aroused Brain**

**Dreams and Consciousness**:
- Common sense suggests that "conscious" experiences involve being awake, but dreams occur during sleep
- Dreams are inconsistently classified as conscious or unconscious experiences based on common wisdom

**Dream Mentation in NREM and REM Sleep**:
- The term "dreaming" is often used to refer to the thoughtlike mentation that occurs during both NREM and REM sleep
- However, some researchers argue that dreaming should only be associated with the bizarre and fantastic mentation of REM sleep
- This debate continues as research on the role of NREM sleep in dreaming continues

**Differences between NREM and REM Dreams**:
- NREM dreams are often more mundane and nonbizarre, unlike the fantastical REM dreams
- Prosopagnosics do not report dreaming faces due to their inability to recognize faces during sleep
- People with right parietal lobe lesions have visual imagery issues in both NREM and awake experiences

**Function of Dream Sleep**:
- Researchers study the functions of REM and NREM sleep, including its role in memory consolidation
- The distinction between REM and NREM dreaming raises questions about what constitutes a "dream" for scientific purposes

**Theoretical Implications of NREM and REM Sleep**:
- Some researchers argue that the sensorily dull but thoughtlike mentation of NREM sleep challenges the idea of unconsciousness during NREM sleep
- The debate on this issue continues, with some arguing that information processing occurs even in Stage IV NREM sleep

### 6 Unconscious Processes in Social Interaction

**General Social Interaction Cycle (GSI Cycle)**

**Components:**
1. Actor enters situation:
   - Goal in mind
   - Carries social knowledge
   - Repertoire of cognitive and motor skills
2. Forming impression of target:
   - Combine preexisting knowledge with new information
   - Act based on impression
3. Target's response:
   - Carries own fund of social knowledge
   - Forms impression of situation
   - Acts based on impression
4. GSI Cycle repeats as interaction unfolds

**Actor (Initiator)**:
- Enters a dyadic interaction with a goal in mind
- Carries social intelligence: declarative and procedural knowledge, skills
- Forms an impression of the target based on preexisting knowledge and new information acquired through perception
- Acts based on her/his interpretation of the situation

**Target (Responder)**:
- Enters a dyadic interaction with a fund of social knowledge
- Forms an impression of the situation
- On the basis of this impression, responds to the actor's action or inaction
- May hold options open for future interactions while responding to current one.

**Cycle Continues:**
The cycle continues as both participants interact and respond to each other in a dyadic interaction. The GSI Cycle is a useful framework to understand how social behavior emerges from the cognitive processes involved in forming impressions, interpreting situations, and acting based on those interpretations during interactions between individuals.

---

#### Unconscious Determinants in Social Interaction Automatic Processes and Implicit Perception

**Attention Shifts: Cycles of Understanding in Social Interaction**

**Situation**: Actor's Date Proposal Scenario
- Target's thoughts and feelings about actor's behavior
  - Impressions change based on actor's actions
    * He may be seeing someone else?
    * Offers alternative night instead of canceling
  - Decides to accept Saturday night proposal
- Actor's feelings and motivations
  * Confident in asking for a date
  - Learns she has the necessary skills

**Reciprocal Determinism**: Each participant acts based on their understanding of self and other
- Cycles of exchanges between participants
- Modified by own behavior as well

**Unconscious Processes in Social Interaction: Psychological Unconscious**
1. Procedural Knowledge Structures
   * Automatic, without conscious intent
   * Execution consumes little attention
2. Preconscious Processing
   * Declarative knowledge (implicit memory and perception)
3. Subconscious or Co-conscious
   * Percepts and memories not degraded
   * Inaccessible to awareness despite being in the same state as conscious representations (Kihlstrom, 1984, 1990, 1994b)
4. Role of Unconscious Processes in Social Interaction
- Generally accepted that attitudes, impressions, social judgments, aggression, compliance, and other social behaviors are mediated by automatic process es outside awareness and voluntary control (Bargh, 1994; Uleman & Bargh, 1989)
5. Controversial matter in social psychology regarding the role of unconscious influences on cognitive contents accessible to consciousness (Greenwald, 1992; Kihlstrom, 1990, 1994b).
6. In following discussion, I will present studies demonstrating how implicit percepts and memories mediate cognitive, affective, or behavioral aspects of social interaction.

#### Implicit Memory and Social Interaction The Mere Exposure Effect

**The Dissociation Between Explicit and Implicit Memory**

**Boswell's Case**:
- Boswell was a brain-damaged patient with bilateral damage to temporal and basal forebrain structures due to herpes encephalitis.
- He was completely disoriented and failed to recognize health professionals who had worked with him for 13 years.
- Despite this, he was able to make accurate social judgments about the people around him.
- In an experiment, three staff members were instructed to behave in positive, neutral, or negative manners towards Boswell.
- Boswell consistently chose the person who had treated him well and rejected the one who treated him badly, even though he did not recognize their faces.
- This behavior illustrates the dissociation between his explicit (lack of conscious recollection) and implicit memory (unconscious influence from past experiences).

**Korsakoff's Syndrome Patients**:
- These patients have bilateral damage to the diencephalon, including the mammillary bodies, which makes them densely amnesic for events since the onset of their illness.
- In an experiment, they were shown pictures of faces paired with positive or negative biographies and had no memory of the exposures.
- Yet, when asked to indicate which faces they liked, they generally preferred the "good" faces to the "bad" ones, based on the positive/negative characteristics in their biographies.
- This suggests that social judgment can be an expression of implicit memory, even in the absence of conscious recollection.

**The Mere Exposure Effect**:
- The idea is that familiarity breeds admiration, not contempt: repeated exposure to unfamiliar stimuli increases likability ratings.
- Even when subjects do not consciously recognize the targets as familiar, the mere exposure effect occurs.
- This was demonstrated in an experiment where subjects were exposed to 10 irregular polygons that they could not recognize, but preferred the ones they had been exposed to more than the controls.
- This influence on affective judgments counts as evidence of implicit memory, and even more so since the exposures were not consciously perceived in the first place.

**Subliminal Stimulation and Behavior**:
- Subliminal stimulation can affect preferences, but can it affect actual behavior as well?
- The hypothesis is that more favorable attitudes should lead to better interactions, and this was tested by exposing college students to subliminal faces of other students.
- Even with no conscious recognition, subjects showed a preference for the previously-exposed faces, suggesting that subliminal exposure can affect behavior as well.

#### Implicit Social Perception and Preconscious Processing in Forming Impressions

**Preconscious Processing and Impression Formation**

**Experiment by Bornstein et al. (1987)**
- Male subjects exposed to subliminal faces of other men
- Later brought into contact with the targets, who were confederates
- Subjects agreed more with the confederate they had been exposed to in a poetry rating task

**Subliminal Exposure and Emotional Responses**
- Subliminal stimuli can elicit emotional responses without conscious perception
- Niedenthal (1990) study: cartoon character targets preceded by joy or disgust primes
- Response latencies were longer for items studied in the context of disgust vs. joy
- Recognition times shorter when affective context at test was congruent with study

**Preconscious Processing in Impression Formation (Bargh et al., 1986)**
- Subjects read "The Donald Story" paragraph, rated personality based on ambiguous behaviors
- Pre-reading vigilance task presented masked adjectives related to kindness or shyness
- Recognition of these words was poor, but they influenced subjects' impressions of the target
- Primes affected ratings for both kind and shy traits despite being unconsciouly perceived

**Limits on Preconscious Processing**
- Debate between those who believe preconscious processing is limited vs. semantic features can be processed
- Niedenthal's experiment somewhat ambiguous due to claims that emotional expressions can be read directly from faces without cognitive analysis

---

#### Unconscious Influence on Social Perception Limits of Preconscious Semantic Processing

**Bargh Experiments' Implications (Bargh & Pietromonaco, 1982; Bargh et al., 1986)**
- Indicates preconscious semantic processing occurred outside of awareness
- Limits of this preconscious processing are indicated by Greenwald's evaluative judgment experiments (Greenwald, Klinger, & Liu, 1989; Greenwald, 1992)

**Evaluative Judgments Experiments and their Findings**
- Subjects judge whether a target word is positive or negative in connotative meaning
- Prime precedes the target word, separated by a central pattern mask
- Emotional connotations of the prime influence judgments of targets
- More priming when prime is subliminal than supraliminal
- Preconscious processing can extract single word meanings but not construct two-word phrases meaning

**Preconscious Processing Limits**
1. Subjective threshold vs. objective threshold:
   - Objective threshold: point at which forced-choice guesses fall to chance levels
   - Semantic processing possible only between subjective and objective thresholds
2. Automatic vs. controlled processing:
   - Preconscious stimuli can be analyzed by automatic, not controlled processes
3. Influence on feelings, social judgments, interpersonal behaviors despite being unconscious and paid no attention.

### 7 Efference and the Extension of Consciousness

**Efference and the Extension of Consciousness**

**Taste and Smell of Consciousness**:
- Experiment: Observer in a darkened room sees afterimage of hand moving, leaving a black hole where the image was
- This affects suggests "sensory capture," where information from multiple senses is perceived as coming from one source

**Extension of Experience Across Senses**:
- Conscious experience of stimuli can be described in terms of:
  - Frequency, amplitude, complexity (pitch, loudness, timbre)
  - Direction and distance (extension)
- **Taste**: Located internally, experienced as flavor not essence; no directionality or distance
- **Smell**: Experienced internally in the nose, can gather information about direction of smell

**Touch and Kinesthesis**:
- Conscious experience of touch at receptor site (frontier between skin and external world)
- Involves kinesthesia to direct muscular movement

**Visual Perception and Projection of Conscious Images**:
- With vision, conscious event breaks free from the retina and is projected into space
- Observation of Aleister Crowley's "red rose paradox" illustrates the process of neurological response causing a mental representation of a distal object

---

#### Efference Theory Consciousness of Movement and Location

**Model Description**
- The "cornered" form elucidates definition
- Top-down reading: P d (distal physical event), Np (proximal neurological process), Md (mental projection)
- Proximal and distal nodes reflect dominance relationships at different locations
- Three nodes conform to situation in Figure 7.la, left

**Node Examination**
1. First node: P d dominates; a distal physical event
2. Second node: Np dominates ~ ; a neurological response triggers mental projection
3. Third node: Md dominates, projected image of the rose

**Model Manipulation and Interpretation**
- Deepest string can flex to left
- Number of nodes and relative positions remain invariant
- Sequence SI s2s1-1 produced: Figure 7.lb, left
- NpMd~ is a prediction generated by the model
- Unexpected, interpretable, has empirical support

**Interpretation**
- Neurological response (Np) to physical stimulus projects mental image (Md)
- Rose observed mentally instead of physically; mental process keeps loop going
- Problem: Physical event seems irrelevant
- Topological homotopy keeps two forms together, making P d a viable event

**Relation Between dp and pd**
- pdp = dpd in normal perception from real object
- Last half determines conscious perception
- Hallucinations and certain experiences fit this description

**Efference Extension of Consciousness**
- Deepest string suggests separability of pd and pdp
- Dpd sets stage, pdp activates conscious experience
- Automaticity or automatic responses observed when no consciousness felt

**Efference Theory**
- Proposed modification: efference only responsible for location awareness, not pattern perception
- Three phases: command to move, active movement, final position lock
- Uncertain whether afterimage shift due to efference or afference

**Experiment and Results**
- Succinylchloride chloride dihydrate blocks motor neuron connections, suggesting efference cause of afterimage shift
- Preliminary experiments support theory: efference responsible for image movement and location, not other components.

### 8 Edelmans Biological Theory of Consciousness

**Edelman's Theory of Consciousness (1989)**

**Biological Account of Psychological Functions**
- Based on Darwin's evolution and population dynamics principles
- Neuronal Group Selection (TNGS)

**Three Basic Tenets:**
1. **Primary Repertoire**:
   - Collection of neurons in a given brain region forming local circuits and neural networks
   - Originally generated at birth, vastly exceeding number surviving beyond developmental period
   - Remarkable variation in local connectivities due to cellular adhesion molecules regulation and random fluctuation of neurite extensions
2. **Secondary Repertoire**:
   - Established from primary repertoire through strengthening/weakening synapses acquired by behaving organism's experience
   - Experiential selection occurs through differential amplification of certain synaptic populations
3. **Reentrant Connections:**
   - Selects biological groups of neurons in maps based on primary and secondary repertoires

**Mapping:**
- Important feature of brain organization
- Any point in a receptor sheet is represented by population of cortical neurons connected to sensory fibers coming from that point
- Over 25 different maps outside primary visual cortex, vertically arrayed and reacting to similar stimulus properties
- Columnar organization responding to one-dimensional stimulus parameters found in inferotemporal area of monkey cortex (Fujita et al. 1992)
- Maps formed from primary and secondary repertoires connected by massively parallel and two-way connections

**Global Mapping:**
- Contains multiple reentrant local maps connecting sensory and motor areas
- Interconnected with nonmapped brain areas like hippocampus, basal ganglia, cerebellum
- Involved in ordering of both sensory phenomena and patterns of motor activity
- Cerebellum regulates execution of movement by comparing internal information about plans for movement with external feedback from ongoing motor performance
- Basal ganglia involved in cognitive aspects of motor control, long-range planning and execution of complex motor strategies
- Hippocampus not only involved in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory but also receives inputs from both hedonic structures and reentry patterns between maps in global mappings.

**Primary Consciousness:**
- Immediate, ongoing, present-time awareness of objects and events in the world
- Mental scene depicting here and now
- Brain stem/limbic system is the hedonic system mediating internal values based on evolutionary selection for homeostatic autonomic and endocrine functions. It facilitates expression of appetitive, consummatory, defensive behaviors like food or water procurement, sexual reproductive behavior, aggression.

---

#### Edelmans Theory of Consciousness Interplay Between Sensory Systems

**Brain Systems and Consciousness**

**Two Main Brain Systems:**
1. **Brain stem/limbic system**:
   - Includes brainstem reticular formation, hypothalamus, septum, amygdala, and hippocampus
   - Developed early in evolution for internal body functions
   - Receives interoceptive inputs from various organ systems and the autonomic nervous system
2. **Thalamocortical system**:
   - Evolved to receive external sensory receptors and facilitate movement
   - Thalamus projects external world inputs to cortex for categorization and response

**Interaction Between Systems:**
- Learning takes place in various loci including fornix, septal systems, hippocampus, temporal cortex, forebrain, and cingulate gyrus
- Edelman's theory: Global mapping changes over time with appropriate behavior determined by internal criteria

**Primary Consciousness (PC):**
- Results from the interaction between two systems in real time
- Connects features of perceptual scene with their importance based on past history and values
- No notions of past or future, nor self-awareness

**Higher Order Consciousness (HOC):**
- Recognition of one's own feelings and behavior
- Direct awareness of mental episodes having past and future characteristics
- Concept of personal self distinguished from other objects in the world
- Use of language
- Involves Broca's area for speech production and Wernicke's area for speech recognition

**Evolution of Language:**
1. Production of speech sounds became associated with concepts and gestures through learning
2. A lexicon/vocabulary accrued due to semantics
3. Syntax emerged with the correlation of preexisting conceptual learning and a large vocabulary

---

#### Self-Concept and Higher-Order Consciousness in Edelmans Theory of Consciousness

**Broca's and Wernicke's Area:**
- Anatomical substrate for enhancing ability to create, improve, remember new ideas
- Connected via reentrant paths with other cortical areas subserving value-category memory and conceptual memory
- Enhances verbalizations as symbols representing concepts
- Results in development of self-concept and consciousness

**Self-Concept Development:**
- Stores symbolic (social) relations acquired through interactions between self and nonself
- Categorized linguistically through sentences relating self and nonself
- Interplay between speech areas and value-category memory provides internal representation of world and self
- Essential element for liberating organism from present constraints
- Allows differentiation of past from immediate perceptual present
- Higher-order consciousness leads to anticipation of future states, planned behavior, comparison based on personal values and histories, reorganizing memories and plans, linguistic communication.

**Edelman's Theory of Consciousness:**
- Evolution-based theory supported by developmental neurobiology principles
- Augmented by psychological effects of daily environmental change
- Rest on principles of altered reentrant connectivities within global maps resulting in greater linguistic capability and enhanced conscious adaptive flexibility.

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Correlated firings from orientation columns in two separate visual maps (Gray et al., 1989) suggest solution to binding problem
- Somatosensory plasticity findings support notions regarding interactive competition and strengthening synaptic connections (Clark et al., 1988)
- Disruptions of reentrant connections lead to alterations in consciousness due to brain damage, such as HM case (Corkin, 1984), blindsight victims (Weiskrantz et al., 1974), contralateral neglect syndrome (Sacks, 1985), and complete loss of cognition in Karen Ann Quinlan (Kinney et al., 1994)
- Extensive bilateral and symmetric damage to thalamus with less severe damage observed in cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia in case of Karen Ann Quinlan may require reevaluation of thalamus' role in theory.

### 9 The Structure of Subjective Experience Sharpen the Concepts and Terminology

**Problem #1 and Problem #2 in Researching Consciousness**

**Problem #1**:
- Lack of agreement about what needs to be studied

**Problem #2**:
- Disagreement about terminology used to discuss the subject matter

**Terminology Issues**:
- Each researcher has a different interpretation of consciousness
  - Consciousness as a special substance or state
  - Consciousness as a process or system
  - Debate on whether to even use the term "consciousness"

**Solution Approach**:
- Terminology should evolve as concepts become clearer
- Focus on what is interesting and meaningful about mental life

**Current Research Focus**:
- Mechanisms underlying consciousness
- Levels of behavioral achievement

**Proposed Approach**:
- Comprehensive theory of consciousness includes accounts at subjective, neurological, and cognitive levels
- Recognize the importance of subjective experience

**William James' Contribution**:
- Proposed a model of awareness with two distinct parts: nucleus and fringe
  - Nucleus: definite, clear images
  - Fringe: feelings of familiarity, knowing, action tendencies, expectant feelings
- Recognized the importance of the fringe experience in guiding thought

---

#### Fringe Experiences The Tip-of-the-Tongue Phenomenon

**James' Distinction: Fringe vs. Nucleus**

**Background:**
- Critical importance of fringe experiences
- Represents context and network of relations that give meaning to contents in nucleus

**James' Perspective:**
1. Meaning is not intrinsic but given by connections and relations
2. Two parts: fringe and nucleus (not focus of attention, figure/ground, or familiar dichotomies)

**Fringe Experiences:**
- Feeling of knowing, meaning, mismatch (rightness)
- Intense and specific
- Control information for memory search

**Illustration: Tip-of-the-Tongue Phenomenon:**
1. Three fringe experiences active simultaneously
2. Global connection web gives feeling of singularly definite quality
3. Isolated features do not fill constraints to elicit complete feeling of "rightness"
4. Control aspects sustain memory search when retrieval unsuccessful
5. Feeling of being on-the-right-track keeps focus in current region of knowledge.

**James' Contribution:**
1. Clarified qualitative differences among elements in subjective experience
2. Relations among these elements important for scientific psychology.

**Challenge: Contemporary Theorists**
- Some categorize vague awareness as preliminary or defective, ignoring its significance.
- Research and theory often overlook the importance of fringe experiences.

---

#### Relating Jamess Model to Modern Concepts Fringe Awareness in Contemporary Psychology

**Spotlight Metaphor vs James's Model**

**Spotlight Metaphor**:
- Moving spotlight is a powerful metaphor guiding research and theory in awareness
- Clear focus and fuzzy periphery, easily confused with James's "nucleus/fringe" model
- Attention refers to adjustments of the beam (focus, stability, intensity, breadth) or control mechanisms
- Sometimes used synonymously with awareness

**James's Model vs. Spotlight Metaphor**:
- Differences between James's "nucleus/fringe" model and spotlight metaphor
- **Nucleus**: The clear, definite center of attention
- **Fringe**: The vague, haloed area surrounding the nucleus
- Attended experience includes both nucleus and fringe components (e.g., phonological image, meaning, feeling of rightness)
- Relative dominance or foreground quality of nucleus vs. fringe varies

**Contemporary Models vs. James's Model**:
- Contemporary models undervalue or ignore James's "fringe" concept
- Fringe is not the same as unattended/dim, fuzzy fringe of spotlight beam
- Fringe experience presents a summary form of nonconscious information, not just lower resolution

**Mangan's Extension of James's Model: Rehabilitation of Fringe Awareness**:
- Fringe experiences are an overlooked major way to finesse the limited capacity of awareness
- Fringe experience is a radical condensation and presentation of summary information relevant to current topic
- Provides relational/evaluative information, not just more content
- Links fringe awareness to connectionist concepts and "goodness-of-fit" metric.

---

#### Differentiating Awareness Levels Based on Information Provided

**Mangan's Hypothesis**
- Bridge between microcognitive and level of awareness
- Nucleus: definite, but feeling of rightness can be vague or clear
- Fringe experiences: definite or vague depending on user's purposes

**Problems with James's Model**
1. Ambiguity in the term "vague"
   - Imprecise, undefinable, indistinct, hazy, ineffable
2. Multiple meanings of vagueness
   - Dimness, unclear boundaries, missing parts, poor resolution, uncertainty about class membership
3. Vagueness can be attributed to objects or reports
4. Reports may be more definite than experiences
5. Need to clarify purpose for considering an experience vague
6. Difference between fringe and nucleus is not intrinsic but based on suitability of information carried
7. Importance of distinguishing more than two basic varieties of awareness
8. Need to categorize fringe experiences phenomenally and functionally
9. Nonconscious knowledge as a set of representations in property spaces
10. Architectures of concept spaces proposed by various authors, but an oversimplified sketch is sufficient for the present purpose.

---

#### Varieties of Awareness Beyond Focus in Consciousness

**Feature-Awareness vs Fringe-Experience**

**Feature-Awareness**:
- Presented as one part of our awareness
- Corresponds to James's "nucleus"
- Represents the most relevant dimensions of an object, event, or idea for the current topic or goal
- Focuses on the selected dimensions while ignoring others

**Fringe-Experience**:
- Includes information beyond the most relevant features
- Provides evaluational or relational information that explicates items in feature-awareness
- Presents information about nonselected dimensions of input not relevant to the current topic
- Can be categorized into:
  - **Current Topic Summary Awareness**: Information about an object's global meaning and connections beyond the selected features
  - **Competing Topic Summary Awareness**: Nonconscious knowledge related to other topics or goals competing with the current one.

---

#### Taxonomy for Awareness Related to Self-Monitoring

**Self-Monitoring**

**Definition:**
- Complex self-regulating systems use an up-dated map of their state and adaptations
- Self-monitor refers to all processes that keep track of current self in environment

**Characteristics:**
- Hierarchically organized and distributed but simplified for discussion
- Self-awareness differs from self-monitoring: awareness of information about the self vs. monitoring processes

**Importance:**
- Evidence of self-monitoring through knowledge of current mode of organization, goals, actions, and reflexes
- Distinguishable from self-awareness

**Domains Monitored:**
1. **Knowledge**: Metacognitive experiences (feelings of knowing, familiarity, source identification)
2. **Action**: Intentions, sense of effort, agency
3. **Goals**: Emotional awareness (subjective component missing from James' original theory)

**Relationship with Self-Awareness:**
- Distinguishable from self-awareness: knowledge vs. awareness of information about the self

**Distinction from Self-Concept:**
- Knowledge structure consisting of beliefs, attitudes, and facts about "who one is" as an object in the world
- Different from self-monitoring: comes from various sources, not solely based on self-reported data.

---

#### Subjective Experience and Self-Monitoring Framework for Emotions

**Emotions and Personal Goals**
- Emotions: complex events with subjective, physiologic, behavioral, and cognitive components
- Subjective component is a summary representation of one's current personal goal progress
- Emotional responses are brief reactions to significant events that impact personal goals (e.g., anger when progress is blocked, sadness upon loss, happiness with progress)
- Proposed that subjective emotion component is part of self-monitoring events and not wholly different from other awarenesses involved in metacognition, evaluation, and control

**Descriptive Framework for Awareness**
- Initial steps toward a taxonomy of nonfeature-awarenesses related to self-monitoring
- Includes feeling of health, energy, vitality, social distance, and quality (e.g., feeling isolated or connected)
- Scheme indicates a direction for further development by helping group unnoticed connections and focusing on discriminative aspects

**Feeling of Knowing**
- Usually classed as memory research, focusing on correlations between feeling intensity and subsequent memory performance
- Few studies examine how feelings of knowing relate to familiarity, global meaning, and underlying knowledge structure
- Details of questions or instructions for subjects are critical in tests of implicit memory (e.g., blindsight phenomena in patients with occipital cortical lesions)

**Conclusion**
- A complete theory of awareness requires accounts at the subjective level as well as neurological, cognitive, and behavioral levels
- Contemporary psychologists hold various convictions about the causal potency of awareness; attending to subjective experience is beneficial for understanding underlying structures.

---

#### Varieties of Awareness in Psychology and Cognitive Science

**The Structure of Subjective Experience**

**Awareness:**
- First-person subjective experience
- Distinguishable from underlying mechanisms and control systems
- Metaphor: A medium in which information is presented
- Examples: Paper, ink, words, concepts

**Terminology**:
- James's terms: awareness, will, voluntary, self
- Problems with terminology (contemporary psychologists use various terms)

**Two-part Structure of Subjective Experience:**
1. Nucleus and Fringe:
   - James's metaphor for dynamic aspects of awareness
   - Nucleus refers to functionally distinct parts
   - Fringe refers to form of thought contents at a particular moment
2. Jackendoff's Model (1987):
   - Includes some features similar to James's two-part structure
   - Two qualitatively different aspects: source information, feelings of agency, novelty, meaningfulness, and emotional liking versus disliking
   - Has not been developed further by Jackendoff or others
3. Mangan's Work (1988):
   - Focuses on the feeling of "rightness" or "on-track-ness"
   - Plays a central role in attention, problem-solving, aesthetics, and religious experience
4. Self-Monitoring:
   - Separate self from self-concept and self-awareness
   - Define self as the overall organization that makes a person an entity
5. Other References on Awareness:
   - Norman and Shallice (1986), Baars (1988) proposed models for awareness selection

### 10 The Varieties of Conscious Experience Biological Roots and Social Usages

**The Varieties of Conscious Experience: Biological Roots and Social Usages**

**Modern Psychology's Assumption**:
- Mental states depend on bodily conditions, thoroughgoing and complete
- All mental states have an organic process as their condition

**Organic Foundations of Thoughts and Feelings**:
- Even scientific doctrines and disbeliefs arise from the state of one's body
- Religious emotions are equally organically founded

**Brain-Consciousness Relationship**:
- Brain tissue and conscious experience have a special relationship
- Comparing brain pathology to behavioral aberrations is a longstanding process
- Experimental and observational data can provide transparency into the mind-matter relation

**Understanding the Mind-Matter Relation**:
- The time is ripe for an advance in understanding due to available experimental and observational data
- The relationship between brain and conscious experience is implemented at the microprocessing level
- Electrochemical synaptodendritic states coordinate with states of consciousness
- Peptides like endorphins and enkephalins are related to experiences of pain and stress

**Sensory Systems and Perception**:
- Detailed descriptions of the relations between sensory systems in the brain and perception
- States of consciousness can determine contents, as seen with hunger and thirst

**Different States of Consciousness**:
- Distinguished based on responsiveness to prodding or incoherent thrashing
- Comatose individuals show no response

---

#### Synaptodendritic Processing Domains in Rat Whiskers

**State-Dependent Consciousness: Synaptodendritic Microprocesses**

**Mutual Exclusiveness of Conscious States:**
- Different conscious states not readily available to each other
- Evidence from various observations: state-dependent learning, salmon spawning, hypnosis, dissociation in epileptics
- Same basic synaptodendritic electrochemical substrate organized differently for different conscious states

**Demonstrating Synaptodendritic Processing Domains:**
- Experiments on rat somatosensory system
- Whisker stimulation by rotating cylinders with varying step widths and speeds
- Three separable processes: sensory input, synaptodendritic field potentials, output of axon hillock
- Results provide maps of bursts or spikes generated at each spectral location based on spatial and temporal parameters of the sensory input
- Spatial frequencies scaled in 500 Hz, temporal frequencies in revolutions per second

**Synaptodendritic Processing Domains:**
- Density of stimulation a function of both spacings of cylinder grooves and speed of rotation (spectral domain)
- Single whisker experiments: irregular and broadly tuned receptive field potential manifolds due to constraints such as anatomical extent and inhibitory/excitatory relationships between fields.

---

#### Gabor-Like Manifolds and Cortical Processing Medium

**Pribram's Analysis of Consciousness: Relationship Between Manifolds Derived from Bursts and Single Units**

**Manifestations of Continuity between Levels of Analysis:**
- Demonstration of continuity between burst manifolds and single unit manifests (Figures 10.3, 10.4a-d)
- Similarities to receptive field characteristics in the primary visual cortex suggest ubiquitous processing medium in cortical synaptodendritic network

**Posterior Intrinsic Cortex and Sensory-Specific Agnosias:**
- Agnosias not due to distinguishing cues but utilizing them for choices among alternatives (Pribram & Mishkin, 1955; Pribram, 1969)
- Information processing essential for uncertainty reduction (Shannon & Weaver, 1949)
- Posterior intrinsic cortex determines range of alternatives and sample size for informative elements

**Objective Consciousness: The Posterior Cerebral Convexity - Projection of Sensory Experience - Perifissural Cortex:**
- Systems labeled extrinsic due to close ties with peripheral structures (Rose & Woolsey, 1949; Pribram, 1960)
- Interactions mapped isomorphically onto perifissural cortical surface
- Local injuries result in scotomas or sensory/motor deficits
- Epicritic processing takes place within these systems
- Constructs objective reality for organisms through movement and projection of results beyond surfaces.

**The Persona: V Extrapersonal Distinction - Basal Ganglia and Right Hemisphere Lesions:**
- Agnosias not due to distinguishing cues but utilizing them for choices among alternatives (Pribram & Mishkin, 1955; Pribram, 1969)
- Information processing essential for uncertainty reduction (Shannon & Weaver, 1949)
- Posterior intrinsic cortex determines range of alternatives and sample size for informative elements.

---

#### Behavioral Changes Following Amygdala Lesions in Monkeys

**Patient with Difficulty Sitting Up in Bed:**
- Patient repeatedly had trouble sitting up due to an arm becoming entangled in bedclothes
- Perception of personal body space was lost, consciousness "extinguished"
- Distinction between personal and extrapersonal reality:
  - Personal body space: within reach, influenced by use (frontal cortex)
  - Extrapersonal reality: beyond reach, objective (parietal cortex)

**Brain Locations Involved in Agnosia vs. Neglect:**
- Studies on patients and monkeys unable to separate agnosia from neglect
- Agnosia related to meaning as defined by corporeal use
- Basal ganglia involvement indicates connection between intrinsic cortex and basal ganglia

**Limbic Forebrain and Instinct: Episodic Consciousness**
- Behavioral changes in "four Fs" (fighting, fleeing, feeding, sex) after amygdalectomy
  - Tamed behavior, increased weight gain, heightened sexual behavior
  - Summary: shared species-specific behaviors
- Instinct vs. species-specific behaviors: preference for retaining instinct concept
- Species-shared behavior patterns of interest in tracking effects of amygdalectomy.

---

#### Amygdala and Memory Processes Orienting Familiarity and Distraction

**Impact of Amygdala Lesions on Behavior: Effects on Feeding, Fighting, Avoidance, and Sexual Behavior**

**Amygdalectomy and Feeding:**
- Monkeys continue eating past the point when controls stop
- Increased indiscriminate consumption of objects
- Undisturbed order of preference for food and nonfood items
- Effects due to connections with satiety mechanism in ventromedial hypothalamus
- Precise relationship between carbachol injected into amygdala and amount of feeding or drinking

**Amygdalectomy and Fighting:**
- Overly prolonged aggressive interactions leading to reorganization of dominance hierarchy
- Prior experiences have little influence after amygdalectomy
- Effects on avoidance behavior: memory aspect affected, feeling of fears constraining behavior unaffected

**Amygdalectomy and Sexual Behavior:**
- Hypersexuality due to increased territory and range of situations where behavior manifested
- Ordinarily cats perceive unfamiliar territory as inappropriate for sexual behavior
- Importance of amygdala in determining spatial and temporal boundaries of an episode or behavioral routine

**Familiarization: Amygdala's Role**
- Orienting reaction towards novel vs familiar, which serves as context
- Familiarity is fragile and easily disrupted by head injury or distraction
- Resistance to distraction provided by a viscerautonomic "booster" process involving the amygdala

**Familiarity and Receptions:**
- Conscious feeling regarding an experience
- Clinically, patients with lesions in amygdala region describe "jamais vu" and "deja vu" experiences
- In laboratory settings, familiarity related to reinforcement history: monkeys trained on a 70% reward schedule for selecting one of two cues.

---

#### Frontal Cortex and Executive Functioning

**Episodic Processing and Consciousness:**

**Consequences**:
- Outcomes of behavior that guide action
- Reinforcers or deterrents influencing recurrence of behavior
- Sequence of events with predictive value (confidence estimates)
- Can become envisioned eventualities in humans

**Familiarization and Orienting Reactions**:
- Repeated exposure to stimulus habituates, leading to familiarization
- Disrupted by limbic (amygdala) and frontal lesions
- Orienting reactions disrupt familiarization and lead to inconsequential outcomes
- Segmented into episodes with confidence values established through coherences and correlations among events
- Commitment to a course of action guides further action

**Frontal Cortex and Limbic Forebrain**:
- Relationship between frontal intrinsic cortex and limbic forebrain
- Frontal lesions lead to perseverative or distractible behavior in monkeys and humans
- Subjects with frontal lesions fail to be guided by consequences

**Executive Processor**:
- Directs and allocates resources of the brain
- Input from sensory receptors typically preempts allocation, creating a "temporary dominant focus"
- When extra demands are placed on routine operations, coherences among proprieties and priorities must be organized
- Proprieties structure competencies, priorities are ordered, and practicalities assessed

**Far Frontal Cortex**:
- Surrounded by systems related to somatomotor and visceroautonomic effects
- Derives input from medial portion of thalamus (n. medialis dorsalis)
- Close anatomical relationship to limbic medial forebrain in primates

---

#### Far Frontal Cortex and Narrative Construction for Conscious Experience Enhancement

**Understanding Far Frontal Cortex and its Role in Processing Covariation**

**Three Major Divisions of Far-Frontal Systems:**
1. Orbital system: Reciprocally connected with amygdala and basal ganglia, involved in what to do based on familiarity.
2. Lateral system: Deals with how something is to be done.
3. Dorsal portions of the lobe mediate when to do it.

**Effects of Damage to Far-Frontal Cortex:**
- Impairment in processing middle portions of an episode (Milner, 1982; Kinsbourne and Wood, 1975).
- Inability to "temporally tag" events or place them within the episode.
- Derangement of context that structures an episode.

**Role in Processing Covariation:**
- Cross-temporal, spatiotemporal, and cross-spatial contingencies are processed.
- In classical and operant conditioning, processing is influenced by two or more distinct sets of covarying contextual contingencies (Brody and Pribram, 1978; Pribram et al., 1967).

**Far Frontal Cortex and Consciousness:**
- Consciousness is manifest when familiarization is perturbed and episodes are updated and incorporated into narrative.
- Consciousness becomes attenuated when actions and their guides cohere, resulting in skilled, graceful, and automatic behavior.

**Transcendental Consciousness:**
- Far frontal cortex has been linked to transcendent states of consciousness.
- James explored both ordinary and extraordinary states of consciousness (James, 1870).

#### Consciousness and Holistic Processing in Esoteric Traditions

**The Esoteric Tradition in Western Culture and Mystical Traditions of the Far East**
- Replete with instances of uncommon states producing uncommon contents
- Achieved through various techniques like meditation, Yoga, or Zen
- Experiences differ from ordinary feelings or perceptions, e.g., oceanic merging, out-of-body experiences, and "meta-me" experiences
- Induced by drugs including anesthetics affecting neural cytoskeleton and synaptodendritic microprocesses
- Contents attributed to encompassing structures, addressing spiritual domains

**Cortical Synaptodenatritic Domains and Brain Function**
- Correspondence between cortical synaptodenatritic domains and organization of sensory surfaces
- Internal organization of domains embodies spectral dimension: tuned to limited bandwidths of radiant energy, sound, and tactile vibration
- Evidence extensively reviewed by author (Pribram 1966, 1971a, 1982, 1991, Pribram et al. 1974)

**Holography and Brain Function**
- Engineers, psychophysicists, and neuroscientists saw relevance of holography to memory and perception issues
- Holography provided a palpable instantiation of distributed memory and how percepts could be received from a disbibuted store
- Holistic processing induced by frontolimbic excitation allows elimination of inhibitory surrounds, enabling "intuitive" consciousness not limited to choices among alternatives

**Quantum Physics and Consciousness**
- Limit to accuracy of certain measurements when others are being taken: indeterminacy
- Gabor's description of quantum of information leads to unit of minimum uncertainty and convergence with understanding of communication microstructure and matter structure
- Some physicists note similarity between observer specification in quantum physics and esoteric descriptions of consciousness, resulting in books like "The Tao of Physics" (Capra 1975) and "The Dance of the Wu Li Masters" (Zukav 1971)

#### Unifying Science and Spirituality The Evolution of Consciousness

**The Shift in Western Thought:**
- A real revolution is occurring in Western thought
- Scientific and esoteric traditions have been at odds since Galileo's time
- Each scientific discovery has widened the rift between objective science and subjective spiritual aspects of human nature
- The discoveries of twentieth century science do not fit this mold
- Recent findings of science and spiritual experiences are consonant with one another

**Understanding Consciousness:**
- States of consciousness linked to electrochemical configurations of synaptodendritic domains
- Conscious processing involves attention, volition, and thought
- Contents of consciousness fall into three major categories:
  1. Construction of personal and extrapersonal objective reality by posterior cerebral convexity systems
  2. Creation of narrative through frontolimbic forebrain
  3. Transcendental variety of consciousness that goes beyond narrative, freeing the cortical den-dritic microprocess from spatiotemporal constraints
- Understanding consciousness demands deconstruction into loosely connected components
- Intuition may rest on the unity of experiencing, not what is experienced or how experience is generated

**Consciousness as Experiencing:**
- Dictionary definition: Consciousness = to try, to test
- Affinity between consciousness and Experience (untested)
- Consciousness occurs when some destabilizing "trying" event or series of events takes place
- To be conscious is to experience, to be tried and to try

## III Medicine

**Study of Consciousness and Brain Structure**
- Significant advances expected in study of consciousness due to greater understanding of brain structure and mind dynamics compared to William James' time
- This section explores mind behavior under stress and neuropathology, tracing back to Paul Broca's studies on effects of brain injuries over a century ago

**Unconscious States Under Acceleration**
- Chapter 11 by James Whinnery: Transitions between conscious and unconscious states under acceleration
- Subjects losing consciousness in high acceleration fields with subsequent regain
- Stages of recovery: myoclonic convulsions, dreamlets, memory return, vision, awareness, motor function, clearing confusion/disorientation, normal consciousness
- Comparison to "near death experiences" and suggestions for thermodynamic framework

**Split Brain Patients**
- Roger Sperry's work on split-brain patients suggesting independent consciousness in both hemispheres following commissurotomy
- Chapter 12: Victor Mark's study of a patient with self-contradictory speech and limb gestures, no insight into behavioral conflict
- Conclusion: Each hemisphere can be conscious but unable to resolve disparate interpretations and desires due to the commissurotomy lesion
- Systematic studies by Marco Iacoboni, Jan Raymond, and Eran Zaidel agreeing with Sperry's findings
- Chapter 13: Complete commis-surotomy patient distinguishing words from nonwords separately in both hemispheres; different interpretations given
- Polly Henninger's study isolating hemispheres in two commissurotomy subjects, showing distinct perceptual processing styles
- Right hemisphere organizes perception using spatial templates, left hemisphere has difficulty with ambiguous shapes unless verbally labeled

**Impairments in Self-Awareness of Deficits (Anosognosia)**
- Britt Anderson and Thomas Head studying patients with severe sensory aphasia unable to comprehend
- Patients showing autonomic responses despite no apparent conscious reaction
- Suggests subconscious appreciation of humor, vision, and smell may occur

**Defects in Self-Monitoring of Awareness in Alzheimer's Patients**
- Alfred Kaszniak and Gina Di Traglia Christen describing impairments in self-awareness of deficits (anosognosia) in neurological disorders
- Review of research on Alzheimer's patients and their ability to monitor their own behavior, including dementia symptoms and experimental methods
- Conclusion: Self-monitoring aspect of awareness deteriorates in Alzheimer's patients.

### 11 Induction of Consciousness in the Ischemic Brain

**Background:**
- Fighter aviation research into consciousness and its alterations
- Unconsciousness induced through high, sustained +Gz stress using a human centrifuge
- Risk balanced by reduction of fighter aviation mishaps resulting from G-LOC

**Description of Fighter Aviation Medicine and +Gz Stress:**
- Highly maneuverable aircraft with rapid acceleration (>+9G)
- Exceeds pilot's unprotected tolerance, inducing ischemia and loss of consciousness (G-LOC)
- Human centrifuge simulates in-flight acceleration environment

**Research Approach:**
1. Describe G-LOC phenomenon through acquisition of data on episodes
2. Develop quantitative description of G-LOC syndrome
3. Establish kinetic relationships to develop a mechanistic theory
4. Conduct experiments based on theory of G-LOC

**Significance:**
- Understanding consciousness and its neurological basis through fighter aviation research
- Reducing risk associated with +Gz stress in aircraft piloting.

#### The G-LOC Syndrome Neurological Response to Gravity Stress

**G-LOC Syndrome: Understanding Consciousness Through Experimental Approaches**

**Background:**
- Developing a thermodynamic description of consciousness and unconsciousness through G-LOC syndrome research (Whinnery, 1994)
- Classical techniques used for understanding various phenomena in the physical, chemical, and biological world
- Unique vantage point to investigate normal human consciousness response to +Gz stress

**Importance:**
- Distinguishing loss of consciousness symptoms from pathological processes
- Recovery is complete without residual consequences or disqualification from flying duties
- Symptoms dependent on both level and rate of onset/offset of Gz stress

**Symptom Complex Sequence:**
1. **Visual symptoms**: loss of peripheral vision, tunnel vision, complete blackout (unique due to increased intraocular pressure)
2. **Loss of consciousness**: not always observable during G-LOC syndrome
3. **Electroencephalographic changes** and myoclonic jerking
4. **Recovery symptoms**: most recognizable during recovery period
5. **Manipulating kinetic characteristics** to reduce incapacitation period for fighter pilots

**Table 11.1:** Individual symptoms of the G-LOC syndrome correspond to specific functional configurations in the nervous system caused by alterations in energy (blood flow) and anatomic structure.

---

#### Adverse Gravitational Effects on Consciousness

**Loss of Peripheral Vision and Consciousness: G-LOC Syndrome and Strangulation**

**Table 11.1**: Whinnery's Hypothesis for Induction of Consciousness in the Ischemic Brain

1. **Vision Symptoms:**
   * Loss of peripheral vision
   * Tunnel vision
   * Blackout
   * Loss of consciousness
   * Loss of motor control/function
   * Loss of sensory input
   * Loss of memory capability
   * Myoclonic convulsions
   * Recovery of sensory input
   * Recovery of memory capability
   * Dreamlets
   * Return of vision
   * Return of consciousness
   * Confusion/disorientation
2. **Factors Influencing Vision and Consciousness Loss:**
   * +Gz-stress (effects on areas most superior within the +Gz-field)
   * Vascular system architecture (distal perfusion affected first, central artery last)
   * Differential sensitivity of various regions in CPNS to ischemia
   * Characteristics of specific +Gz-profile
3. **Loss of Consciousness:**
   * Unknown exact perfusion pattern within the CPNS when consciousness is compromised
   * Combination of factors plays a role, with +Gz-stress assumed as least partial causal
4. **Strangulation vs. G-LOC Syndrome**
   * Similar symptom complexes and kinetic profiles despite different modes of inducing CPNS ischemia
5. **CPNS Functional Configurations:**
   * Areas with ischemic compromise lead to dysfunction
   * Resulting symptoms reflect altered functioning of the nervous system
6. **Protective Mechanisms:**
   * Sensory segments alter in response to environmental changes
   * Segments for locomotion enable evasive action or configuration change
7. **Gravitational Field and Evolution**
   * Continuous struggle for survival within organismal niches
   * Adaptation to earth's gravitational field impacts evolutionary development
8. **Transition from Aquatic to Terrestrial Life:**
   * Successful survival requires sensing adverse conditions and avoiding them or altering activities/configurations
9. **Adaptation to Earth's 1Gz Gravitational Environment**
   * Transition from zero +Gz (oceans) to -1 Gx (land) and finally to +1 Gz (upright on land) facilitated human evolution

#### Protection Mechanisms of the Central Nervous System in Gravitational Stress

**Healthy Humans and Gravitational Stress**
- Humans rarely have problems coping with normal gravitational stress
- Problems arise when entering aerospace or high-G environments (e.g., fighter aviation)
- These environments are life-threatening and require life support to prevent consciousness compromise
- Threats include altitude-induced hypoxia and acceleration (+Gz)-induced ischemia/hypoxia

**Adaptation to Non-Evolved Environments**
- Adapting to non-evolved environments (like space or high G) is difficult for humans
- Astronauts have difficulty adapting to microgravity environment of space
- High-G environments present more acute difficulties, especially in fighter aviation

**Protective Mechanisms in Response to Gravitational Stress**
1. **Cardiovascular System**: Provides first line of defense by maintaining normal function and perfusion over a range of pressures
2. **Neurovascular Reserve and Reflexes**: Respond when cardiovascular reserve is insufficient to maintain energy supply
3. **Central Nervous System (CNS) Functional Buffer Period**: Maintains conscious function for 6 seconds during ischemic/hypoxic embarrassment
4. **Warning Symptoms**: Loss of peripheral vision, dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea
5. **G-LOC Syndrome Responses**: Protective mechanisms to enhance survival when CNS protective responses are overcome by +Gz stress
6. **Myoclonic Convulsions**: Reduce exposure to high G forces and conserve energy for basic cellular integrity
7. **Psychophysiological Alterations**: Enhance ability to recognize and avoid loss of consciousness episodes
8. **Orientational Motor Response**: Reorients individual when unconsciousness is severe enough to facilitate recovery.

**Theoretical Framework: Consciousness as a Protective Mechanism**
- Approaching neurologic states from a protective perspective facilitates understanding of central nervous system responses
- Consciousness represents primary protection for the organism in response to external threats, while unconsciousness protects the nervous system against internal ischemic/hypoxic threats.

#### Thermodynamic Analysis of Consciousness Levels in the Human Nervous System

**Neurological States and Thermodynamic Considerations**

**Background:**
- Human survival relies on a powerful nervous system capable of modifying the environment for survival
- Consciousness allows optimal function, but requires continuous energy supply
- Unconsciousness conserves energy when threatened internally

**G-LOC Syndrome:**
- Complex neurological state transition from unconsciousness to consciousness: subconsciousness
- Subconsciousness involves partial restoration of internal energy and absorption of external energy
- Final transition marked by ability to emit responses

**Thermodynamic Analysis:**
- Normal consciousness dependent on absorbing, converting, and emitting neurologic energy
- Neurological states influenced by mass (m), energy (E), and structure (S)
- Unified theory of loss of consciousness: independent of specific alteration mechanisms

**Neurological States:**
1. Hyperconsciousness
2. Consciousness
3. Self-Consciousness
4. Unconsciousness
5. Subconsciousness
6. Death

**Thermodynamic Description:**
C = f(m, E, S)

**G-LOC Syndrome Expansion:**
1. Alterations of neurologic energy induced by +Gz-stress
2. Manipulation of neurological states through energy and structure manipulation
3. Continuum of neurological energy content, possibly quantized with improved measurement capabilities
4. Arbitrary normal ranges defined based on observable capabilities (memory, response, sensing)
5. Classical approach to understanding consciousness using experimental data.

---

#### Exploring Consciousness through G-LOC Syndrome and Near-Death Experiences

**G-LOC Theory and Unconsciousness**
* G-LOC theory useful for investigating consciousness in healthy humans
* Opportunity to experimentally manipulate neurologic state of nervous system
* Standard scientific approach used: thermodynamics, kinetics
* Pathologic change depends on extent and duration of energy supply decrement
* Nervous system has minimal reserve upon which to maintain integrity
* G-LOC kinetics show minimum neurologic state energy content is less than unconsciousness
* Death a clinical sense a state from which normal consciousness cannot be attained
* Spectrum of neurologic states arises from various ischemic insults
* Similarities between NDE symptoms and G-LOC episode due to loss/recovery of consciousness
* Focus NDE research on unique occurrences not present in G-LOC episode
* Understanding and predicting neurologic function facilitated by considering consciousness and unconsciousness as evolved processes
* Balance between the two states ensures successful survival in threatening environments.
**G-LOC Syndrome Symptoms and Psychophysiologic Alterations**
* Tunnel vision / bright light
* Floating
* Automatic movement
* Autoscopy
* Out-of-body experience
* Not wanting to be disturbed
* Paralysis
* Vivid dreamlet / beautiful places
* Pleasurable experience
* Psychologic state alteration: euphoria, dissociation
* Friends/family inclusion
* Prior memories / thoughts inclusion
* Very memorable when remembered
* Confabulation
* Strong urge to understand experience.
**Comparison of Neurologic States in G-LOC Experiences and Near Death Experiences (NDE)**
1. Similarities: tunnel vision / bright light, floating, automatic movement, autoscopy, out-of-body experience, paralysis, vivid dreamlet / beautiful places, pleasurable experience, psychologic state alteration a. Euphoria b. Dissociation, friends/family inclusion, prior memories / thoughts inclusion, very memorable when remembered, confabulation
2. Unique to NDE: strong urge to understand experience.
**Conclusion**
* G-LOC theory provides understanding of neurologic states and their relationship to consciousness
* Further development of experimental evidence and theory will lead to insight into potential inconsistencies
* Broad range of information applicable to evolutionary development, mechanisms for ensuring survival, neurologic states during life, ultimate pathway followed at the end of life.

### 12 Conflicting Communicative Behavior in a Split-Brain Patient Support for Dual Consciousness

**Case Report: Unusual Brain Development and Consciousness**
- Young woman developed frequent epileptic seizures from age eight, including sudden collapses and lapses of attention
- Indications of prenatal brain development issues: strong left hand preference, cortical heterotopia in MRI scans
- Highest intelligence score was 75 due to medication use
- Underwent corpus callosum division surgery (split-brain procedure) when seizures were severe
- Post-surgery: gait incoordination and speech dysfluency
- Unusual behaviors during rehabilitation: left hand disrupting right hand actions, self-contradictory responses on psychological tests, emotional outbursts during conflicts between hands and personalities.

---

#### Dual Consciousness in Split-Brain Patient Unified Mind Through Internal Resolution Loss

**Patient's Condition After Corpus Callosotomy:**
- Unable to identify tracings or name objects held in left hand due to hemispheric dissociation
- Right hemisphere: unable to label or send information for verbal interpretation from left hand
- Left hemisphere: unaware of left hand's feelings
- Both hemispheres could organize speech but with different opinions on the patient's abilities

**Wada Test Results:**
- Presurgical evaluation revealed hemispheric differences in language control based on handedness
- Patient was a non-right hander, indicating bilateral hemispheric control of speech
- Each hemisphere could organize speech but had distinct opinions about the patient's abilities

**Manual Responses:**
- Distinct gestures from each hand indicated opposing views on seizure control and numbness
- Left hemisphere tried to suppress right hemisphere's manual response
- Competition between desires for societal expectations vs personal wishes

**Hemispheric Consciousness:**
- Each cerebral hemisphere maintained distinct opinions, comprehended speech and print on a basic level, and expressed views through speaking, pointing, and gestures (counting with fingers)
- Neither hemisphere was aware of each other's thoughts prior to expression
- Lack of inner resolution leading to uncontrolled spoken or manual combat is unusual but can occur after impaired compensation for interhemispheric dissociation.

### 13 Left Brain Says Yes Right Brain Says No Normative Duality in the Split Brain

**Experiment Overview**
- Investigated split brain patient NG's capacity to coordinate decisions about lexical status of letter strings presented to each hemisphere
- Used ambiguity in simultaneous presentation of different letter strings to reveal hemispheric control mechanisms
- Patient performed a lexical decision task, responding with left or right hand based on target hemisphere and response hand
- Unilateral conditions: Target appeared alone in one visual field; no difference between unilateral and bilateral presentations in accuracy or latency
- Words recognized faster than nonwords (724ms vs. 964ms)
- Strong bias for word decisions in RVF with right hand, nonword decisions in LVF with left hand
- Bilateral conditions: Target string accompanied by distractor in opposite visual field; response hand determined which hemisphere dominates
- Decision process in disconnected hemispheres sometimes opposing due to independent "decision makers" and separate access to hands
- Data inconsistent with hypothesis of one undivided control system, suggests normative duality in the split brain

**Findings**
- Strong bias for word decisions in RVF with right hand (Figure 13.1)
- Nonword responses correct in 19 out of 20 with strong nonword bias in LVF with left hand (Figure 13.2)
- Unilateral conditions reflect different degrees of decision bias dominance: LVF-Lh shows weak dominance by right hemisphere, LVF-Rh shows strong dominance by left hemisphere
- Bilateral presentations result in direct conflict between competing decision biases in opposite hemispheres (Figures 13.3 and 13.4)
- Separation of response criteria in NG contradicts hypothesis of one undivided control system, suggesting normative duality in the split brain.

### 14 Inkblot Testing of Commissurotomy Subjects Contrasting Modes of Organizing Reality

**The Inkblot Testing of Commissurotomy Subjects: Contrasting Modes of Organizing Reality**

**Subjective Experience and Brain Anatomy/Physiology**:
- Subjective experience often appears to be unified
- Research with commisurotomy (split-brain) patients shows that each cerebral hemisphere can function independently, seemingly unaware of the other's conscious contents

**Commissurotomy and Consciousness**:
- Commissurotomy subjects act or speak as if two consciousnesses are operating
- This suggests the presence of two independent sources of control, one out of the awareness of the other

**Investigating the Hemispheres' Contribution to Consciousness**:
- Commissurotomy provides a means for investigating the nature of each hemisphere's contribution to consciousness
- Offers a possible way to understand instances when unity is absent, such as in certain dissociative disorders

**The "Split-Brain" Procedure and Its Limitations**:
- Cerebral commissurotomy (split-brain) operation involves complete callosal section, with or without anterior commissurotomy
- This procedure isolates the two hemispheres from each other, allowing independent testing
- However, the left hemisphere often dominates in the testing situation

**The Right Hemisphere and Consciousness**:
- Research suggests the right hemisphere is preferentially engaged in form perception and visual-spatial processing
- The Rorschach Inkblot Test, a perceptual diagnostic tool, may be a viable way to elicit sustained right hemisphere processing and avoid left hemisphere dominance

---

#### Hemispheric Lateralization of Rorschach Inkblot Testing in Commissurotomy Patients

**Patient Characteristics:**
- Two complete commissurotomy patients: B and C (males) from Vogel-Bogen series
- Right-handed, underwent procedure for epilepsy treatment
- Extensively studied psychologically, neurologically, and with MRI

**Background:**
- Rorschach test: right hemisphere processes inkblots preferentially
- No direct testing of this hypothesis
- Limited studies on lateralization of Rorschach Test (Lewis 1979, Regard 1991, Yates 1994)
- Study investigates hypothesis using left and right hand drawings for both hemispheres

**Hypothesis:**
- Right hemisphere more adept at extracting information from inkblots
- Drawings of blots shown to left visual field, executed by left hand will be matched correctly more often than those shown to right visual field, executed by the right hand.

**Predictions:**
1. Correct matching of drawings by judges: left hemisphere > right hemisphere
2. More "don't know" responses for right-handed drawings compared to left-handed drawings.

**Materials:**
- Four inkblots created using black permanent ink on good quality bond paper and folded along side
- Common household articles used for lateralizing responding in preliminary testing

**Procedure:**
1. Subjects trained to use left hand for responding based on hand they were shown an object with
2. Inkblots presented twice in both left and right visual fields using lateral limits technique (Figure 14.2)
3. Validated method for testing commissurotomy subjects (Cronin-Golomb 1986a , 1986b, Myers 1985; Trope et al. 1988).

---

#### Lateral Limits Technique for Inkblot Testing in Commissurotomy Subjects

**Experiment 1 Method (Henninger, 1992)**

**Lateral Limits Technique**:
- Subject moves eyes horizontally to find limit of rotation (45-55 degrees off vertical midline)
- Stimuli appear only in temporal half of each retina, projecting to contralateral hemisphere
- Prolonged exposure to left or right visual field while maintaining central vision
- Limited vertical scanning possible with nose guard triggering light on head movement

**Procedure**:
1. First time: Inkblot shown with multiple choice presentation and subject points to correct one
2. Second time: Subject draws what they see using ipsilateral hand (left for left visual field, right for right visual field)
3. Judges naive to subjects, Rorschach test, and study attempt to identify drawings from inkblots
4. Patient's responses compared with original inkblots
5. Repeat process for all inkblots in each visual field

**Patient B**:
- Successfully discriminated inkblots from choices
- Drawings of left visual field looked like simplified versions of blots
- No evidence of rejection or difficulty on left-sided trials

**Patient C**:
- Accurately identified inkblots in left visual field from choices
- First drawing stylized, unrelated to original blot (possibly right hemisphere control)
- Subsequent drawings more fluid with perseveration of figures kissing on right side
- Misidentified two out of four inkblots when presented in right visual field
- Some stylized drawings showed no resemblance to blots, others vague or elephant-related labels
- Attempted using left hand instead of right during right visual field trials.

---

#### Inkblot Testing of Commissurotomy Subjects Perception and Drawing Differences between Hemispheres

**Inkblot Testing of Commissurotomy Subjects**

**Patients B and C**:
- Right hemisphere tried to control processing
- Adequate reliability of judges' ratings (90% for two judges, 50% for all)

**Left vs. Right Sided Blots**:
- Correctly identified 61% of left-sided blots, 44% of right-sided blots
- "Don't know" response given to 15% of left-sided blots and 38% of right-sided blots

**Experiment 2**:

**Subjects and Materials**:
- Patients B and C participated again
- Ten cards from Rorschach Inkblot Test used
- Comparison test with representational objects and additional inkblots

**Procedure**:
- Subject given priming tasks to engage right hemisphere
- Patient B drew blots with both hands, created "double exposure" effect
- Patient C had difficulty engaging right hemisphere, needed more priming trials

**Results**:
- Within 10 days of first testing, subjects retested with Rorschach cards and comparison test
- Subjects asked to point to correct card after seeing it
- Judges attempted to match drawings to Rorschach cards, line drawings, and original blots
- Drawings by patient B showed "considerable perseveration" and similar pattern/template

---

#### Comparing Right vs Left Hemisphere Drawing Styles in Split-Brain Patients

**Patient C's Drawing Behavior:**
- Right hand drawings lacked structure and had more detail
- Selected correct version of Rorschach card II in LVF, black and white fooler in RVF
- Copied Rorschach cards I-VII with graphite pencil, color cards VIII-IX with color
- Drawings appeared representational or unidentifiable based on hemisphere
- Labeled some blots: "splat cat" (right visual half field), "splat cat. Kitty in the mac truck, didn't make it" (left visual field)
- No labeling for color cards (VIII, IX, X)
- Rorschach judgment task more difficult than original study
- Significant difference in distribution of incorrect responses between right and left hemisphere
- Judges more likely to select "don't know" when blot shown to right side, make incorrect match to left side
- Consistent styles reflected in drawings

**Patient C's Labeling Behavior:**
- Labeling led to more labeled drawings that looked like the label and were identifiable
- Investigation of expert judges' performance with patient C's verbalizations
  - Expert judges correctly matched drawing to verbalization in most trials, identified corresponding blots in half the trials (right: 60%, left: 70%)
  - Naive judges performed poorly when matching but accurately identified blots on verbalized trials (right: 50%, left: 90%)
- Significant difference in first experiment suggests right hemisphere advantage for this task and facilitation of right hemispheric control.

**Discussion:**
- Right hemisphere advantage for global processing based on findings from inkblot task
- Copying inkblot cards a successful methodology for inducing right hemisphere control
- Distinct styles reflect combination of differences in manual dexterity, hemispheric specialization, and personality.

---

#### Hemispheric Influence on Rorschach Testing A Study of Commissurotomized Subjects

**Hemisphere Differences in Perception and Processing**
- Research supports hypothesis that left hemisphere draws better due to verbal labeling ability, emotional processing involvement, and spatial articulation deficits in right hemisphere
- Patients C and K's drawings show:
  - Color use only in left-handed drawings of Rorschach color cards
  - Placement of figures on left side after increased right hemisphere activation
  - Silence and noiseless quality during testing sessions with left visual field, indicating full engagement of the right hemisphere
  - Subcortical transfer observed through verbal descriptions and associations from right to left hemisphere
- Reversed question marks suggest right hemisphere output and previous Rorschach testing influence
- Difficulty in reestablishing right hemispheric control during second session may be due to anticipation of labels or anxiety.

**Implications for Normal Brain and Further Study**
- Pilot testing with normal subjects suggests greater difficulty drawing inkblots presented in right visual field, supporting findings on commissurotomy subjects
- Expert judges better at matching drawings to verbal labels than naive ones but not blots, indicating influence of verbal labeling on perception
- Drawing an effective means for accessing emotional material as shown by unidentifiable color card drawings and selection of black & white photocopy versions.

**Commissurotomy Subject's Role in Studying Consciousness**
- Changes in placement of drawings suggest investigating disconnection phenomena with distributed neural networks
- Attentional shifts and control changes observed in split-brain subject reflect large underlying source of activation shared by both hemispheres.

**Hemisphere Differences: Verbal Labeling, Emotional Processing, Spatial Articulation**
- Left hemisphere attempts to convert blots into meaningful labels and projects them onto reality
- Right hemisphere relates blots to basic visual patterns or structures, missing details
- Neither perceives the blot without bias: left hemisphere's error is commission, right hemisphere's error is omission.

**Generalization to Normal Brain and Further Study Recommendations:**
- Drawing an effective method for accessing emotional material in normal subjects
- Comparing drawings with verbal responses for understanding the accessing and suppression of emotional material
- Studying nonverbal emotional processes in commissurotomy subject to further our understanding of consciousness.

### 15 Evidence for Language Comprehension in a Severe Sensory Aphasic

**Introduction**:
- Some knowledge is not accessible to conscious recall
- Examples: Blindsight, prosopagnosia, hemianesthesia, neglect, amnesia
- Question: Does a similar situation exist for language?

**Methods**:
- A 66-year-old aphasic man was read a humor inventory of funny and not funny riddles
- Skin potentials were recorded to determine if subject could distinguish between humorous and non-humorous items
- Validation: Normal men could reliably discriminate the funny and not funny items, both verbally and via skin potential recording

**Results**:
- Most skin potentials above the mean occurred for funny items (7/9)
- Most skin potentials below the mean occurred for non-funny items
- This demonstrated that humorous material elicits a change in listener autonomic activity detectable as a change in skin potential
- This allows an assessment of the comprehension of complex language in subjects who may not be able to comprehend and obey instructions
- The study showed that the subject's comprehension of verbal material occurred covertly before his overt capacity

**Conclusion**:
- This study has implications for theories of language comprehension and conscious access.

### 16 Self-Awareness of Deficit in Patients with Alzheimers Disease

**Alfred W. Kaszniak and Gina Di Traglia's Research on Consciousness and Metacognition in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)**

**Primary vs Reflective Consciousness:**
- Primary consciousness: direct experience of percepts, feelings, thoughts, memories (Farthing 1992)
- Reflective consciousness: thoughts about one's own conscious experiences (Farthing 1992)
  - Necessary for interpreting experience, evaluating behavior, planning actions, and self-awareness

**Metacognition:**
- Term used to describe knowledge about how we perceive, think, remember, behave
- Research focuses on nature, psychological mechanisms, neurobiological correlates
- Debate over whether it represents privileged access or inferences (Flanagan 1992)

**Three Directions for Studying Consciousness:**
1. Phenomenological reports
2. Behavioral observations
3. Neurobiological correlates (including brain studies)

**Neuropsychology of Metacognition Impairments:**
- Disruptions can take various forms depending on the aspect of knowledge inaccessible or unavailable to conscious awareness
- Research on metamemory failure and self-awareness in AD provides insights into nature and neurobiological correlates of self-awareness

**History of Anosognosia:**
- Babinski (1914) observed patients with left-sided paralysis who didn't acknowledge their deficits, coining the term anosognosia
- Observations later extended to other neurological syndromes and dementias like AD and MID
- Empirical studies on unawareness of deficits in AD have more recently emerged.

---

#### Comparing Self-Report and Caregiver Ratings of AD Symptoms

**Anosognosia in Dementia**

**Observations**:
- Term "anosognosia" refers to heterogeneous behaviors and unlikely to depend on specific causes related to cognitive deficits alone
- Most studies focus on unawareness of cognitive deficits, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD)

**Alzheimer's Disease (AD)**:
- Progressive cortical dementia with primary signs appearing due to cortical dysfunction
- Cognitive impairments are the most striking and earliest symptoms
- Majority of studies have examined self-awareness of cognitive deficits in AD, often reporting this as a feature of predominantly cortical degeneration conditions like AD and Pick's disease

**Self-Awareness of Deficits**:
- Impaired self-awareness of deficits has been included in clinical descriptions of dementing illnesses, including AD, Pick's, and Huntington's diseases
- Conclusions regarding awareness vary on whether it is impaired early or late in the course of a progressive dementia
- Frontal lobe pathology is associated with impaired self-awareness of deficits

**Frontal Lobe Pathology**:
- Pick's disease: Loss of insight concerning symptoms may occur earlier than in AD, possibly due to more severe frontal pathology
- Some studies suggest a link between frontal lobe dysfunction and impaired self-awareness

**Empirical Studies**:
- Researchers have employed various methods to study impaired self-awareness: comparing patient self-report vs caregiver ratings, examining concordance between subjective descriptions and objective measures, evaluating accuracy of patients' performance predictions on cognitive tasks
- Results may depend on the specific methodology used

**Reisberg et al. (1985) Study**:
- Interviewed subjects (including normal controls, individuals with senescent forgetfulness, and AD patients) and their spouses regarding memory, emotion, social functioning, and independent functioning
- Discrepancies between patient and spouse ratings increased with severity of cognitive impairment; patients with moderate to severe deficits tended to underestimate their difficulties compared to spouses' assessments

#### Loss of Insight in Alzheimers Disease A Review of Studies

**Studies Examining Self-Awareness in Dementia Patients:**
* DeBettignies et al. (1989) found greater loss of insight for AD patients compared to MID and normal controls based on discrepancies between informant reports and patient self-reports of daily living skills impairment.
* Freidenberg et al. (1990): no significant difference in extent of diminished awareness from DeBettignies study, but related to greater dementia severity, depression, and psychotic features.
* Mangone et al. (1991): impaired patient insight associated with greater severity of dementia and paranoid delusions; best predictors were sustained attention and visual memory.
* Auchus et al. (1994): unaware group had more extensive right cerebral hemisphere degenerative damage but association may be skeptical due to potential disruption of frontal lobes in visuo-constructive tasks.
* McGlone et al. (1990): normal controls reported fewer current memory complaints, significant differences between groups on self-reported and informant ratings of memory functioning, no correlation between patient self-ratings with objective measures or depression score.
* Verhey et al. (1993): awareness was related to severity of dementia but not presence or severity of depression; discrepancy scores computed by Feher et al. (1991) quantified extent of differences between patients' and spouses' assessments of deficits.

**Studies Examining Self-Awareness in Different Types of Dementia:**
* 103 AD, 43 vascular dementia, and 24 other causes of dementia: no significant difference between groups regarding depression symptoms based on discrepancies between patient self-reports and caregiver reports concerning cognitive impairments. Awareness was related to severity of dementia but not presence or severity of depression.

#### Self-Awareness of Cognitive Deficits in Alzheimers Disease Discrepancies and Correlations

**Studies on Self-Awareness of Cognitive Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)**

**Feher et al.'s Study**:
- Asked 38 individuals with probable AD and their caregivers to rate the patients' memory abilities
- Computed a "Denial Score" for each patient by subtracting caregiver mean score from patient mean score
- Results showed AD patients rated their memory abilities more positively than did their caregivers; 17 (45%) of the 38 AD patients rated their memory as above average
- Caregiver ratings correlated with patients' actual performance on neuropsychological tests, but weak relationships found with other measures

**Kaszniak et al.'s Study**:
- Examined unawareness of cognitive and emotional difficulties in AD by assessing patient-caregiver discrepancies in ratings of memory failures, language problems, praxis issues, attention, and emotional symptoms
- 19 mildly to moderately impaired AD patients and their caregivers participated
- Patients underestimated both frequency and seriousness of memory, language, praxis, and attention difficulties compared to caregiver assessments
- Patients and caregivers agreed on frequency and seriousness of emotional issues

**Green et al.'s Study**:
- Compared awareness of memory deficits with awareness of other aspects of cognition and behavior
- 20 mildly impaired AD patients and their family members completed a questionnaire rating patient abilities in recent memory, remote memory, attention, and everyday functioning
- Patients rated themselves as more able than they were rated by family members
- Significant variability in magnitude of patient-family member discrepancy across different abilities rated
- Investigators concluded accuracy of awareness in AD varies for different aspects of cognition and behavior

**Limitations of Self-Awareness Studies**:
- Difficulty interpreting patient-caregiver difference scores due to contributions of underestimation vs. overestimation, patient impairment, or defensive denial
- McGlone et al. (1990) and Feher et al. (1991): AD patients with poor memory task performance often self-report normal memory
- Multiple regression analyses showed self-ratings of worse memory functioning associated with greater dementia severity and depression
- Self-ratings in AAMI group predicted by family ratings, not memory test scores
- Despite significantly lower memory test scores, AD patients did not differ from AAMI group in self-reported memory ability
- Discrepancy between patient self-reports and caregiver ratings may not be due to caregiver overestimation or general intellectual decline alone.

---

#### Comparative Metamemory Studies of Dementia Patients and Controls

**Studies of Self-Awareness of Deficit in Dementia Patients:**
* No single study has addressed all limitations related to self-awareness of deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD)
* Results suggest that most AD patients lack awareness of cognitive impairments, especially intellectual and memory functioning
* Anderson and Tranel's methodology questioned due to potential issues with general intellectual decompensation, inability to disentangle cognitive estimation from self-awareness, comparison of general questions to specific tests, and etiological heterogeneity within the dementia group.
* Schacter et al. found that AD patients consistently overpredict their recall performance more than controls, suggesting an unawareness of deficit but alternative explanations cannot be ruled out
* Correa and Graves employed combined methods to examine metamemory processes in AD patients: discrepancies reported between self-reports and informant reports, impaired self-monitoring, and diminished memory awareness. However, the question of whether this reflects impaired self-awareness or more general difficulties remains unanswered due to subjects only rating their own abilities.
* McGlynn and Kaszniak developed measures to quantitatively assess AD patients' unawareness of memory difficulties through self and relative ratings of everyday life memory-related challenges.

---

#### Dementia Patients Self-Assessment of Memory Deficits

**Self-Awareness of Cognitive Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)**

**McGlynn and Kaszniak (1991b) Study:**
- AD patients underestimated their own cognitive difficulties compared to caregiver ratings
- Patient-caregiver discrepancy increased with patient's cognitive impairment level
- No significant differences between patients and caregivers in estimating each other's cognitive problems
- Self-monitoring of memory functioning seemed to be the specific metacognitive skill breaking down as disease progresses

**Kaszniak and Christen son (1995) Study:**
- Replicated McGlynn and Kaszniak's methodology with longitudinal observations
- AD patients underestimated frequency and seriousness of their memory and other cognitive deficits compared to caregiver ratings
- Greater patient-caregiver discrepancy for recent than remote memory deficits
- Impaired awareness not significantly correlated with depression symptoms
- Decrease in self-awareness of cognitive deficit with dementia progression

**Limitations:**
- AD patients rated only relatives' cognitive abilities who hadn't experienced significant decline, possibly leading to "updating" issues
- Preserved general estimation abilities might be based on recall of caregiver's abilities from earlier times

**Consensus:**
- Persons with AD are impaired in their self-awareness of deficits
- Self-awareness impairment correlates with severity of dementia
- Memory self-monitoring aspect seems to break down rather than reflecting a more general cognitive estimation issue
- Neuropsychological deficits, particularly those related to frontal and right parietal cortical functioning, have been found to correlate with patient awareness
- Some evidence suggests that frontal lobe (right hemisphere) cerebral blood flow is correlated with clinician ratings of impaired awareness in AD patients.

## IV Experimental Neuroscience

**Experimental Neuroscience: Unraveling Consciousness through Research**

**Connectionist Approach to Understanding Consciousness**
- Widely held view from neuroscience research
- Synaptic strengths regulate neural network behavior
- Firing patterns of networks seen as neural correlates of consciousness

**Limitations of Connectionist Approach**
- Debate on completeness or asymptotic nature
- Consciousness may not be fully explained by dynamical complexity of connectionist networks alone

**Role of Preconscious Processing in Consciousness**
- Koch's findings on neuronal substrate of visual consciousness in humans and primates
  * Primary visual cortex does not correlate with awareness
  * Consciousness seen as the tip of an iceberg of pre- and subconscious activities
  - All events within conscious 100 to 200 msec treated as simultaneous by brain

**Studies on Blindsight Patients and Monkeys**
- Stoerig and Cowey's research on visual processing stages: reflexive, phenomenal, consciously accessible
  * Preprocessing knowledge but lack conscious awareness
  - Phenomenal vision occurs in striate cortex as a necessary prelude to conscious visualization
  * Conscious access likely involves entorhinal and perirhinal temporal and prefrontal lobes

**Subconscious Processing and EEG Responses**
- Schwartz's work on olfactory consciousness: blindsmell phenomenon
  * Preconscious awareness without awareness can occur in the same neurons as conscious awareness
- Question: By what mechanisms or criteria do pre-, sub-, or nonconscious processes become conscious?

**Implicit Memory and Anesthetized Patients**
- Cork's study on implicit memory in anesthetized surgical patients
  * Patients may have implicit memory without conscious recall

**Conscious Access to Phenomenal Information**
- Bergenheim et al.'s study on timing and apparent simultaneity in conscious awareness
  * Subjective experience occurs either in the order of arrival or via active brain synchronization for insuring simultaneity

**PET Scanning and Visualization of Brain Activity during Conscious Activity**
- Reiman et al. use positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to localize sites of brain metabolic activity during conscious emotional responses

**General Anesthesia and Electroencephalogram (EEG)**
- Watt's study on correlations between depth of anesthesia and EEG parameters
  * Decrease in dimensionality of EEGs as patients become more deeply anesthetized

**Conscious Thought and Quantum Gravity**
- Nunn et al.'s study on task performance and observation/environmental entanglement with movable pen recorders supports Penrose's linkage between quantum gravity and consciousness.

**Preconscious Processing, Consciousness, and Technology**
- Several chapters discuss peculiar aspects of time in relation to conscious experience, indicating that temporal relations among perceived events may be actively processed to result in apparent simultaneity in consciousness.

### 17 Toward the Neuronal Substrate of Visual Consciousness

**Neural Correlates of Visual Awareness**

**Background:**
- Question about relationship between "awareness" and neuronal activity in nervous system, known as "Mind-Body problem"
- Crick and Koch's approach: find neural correlates of visual awareness

**General Approach:**
1. Focus on experimentally identifying neural correlates of various aspects of visual awareness
2. Limit investigation to unaccessible aspects like function, forms, qualia at this stage
3. Similarities between humans and macaque monkeys in visual systems
4. Main assumption: firing of some neurons in visual cortical system correlates with visual awareness but not all
5. Majority of neurons carry out computations, only a smaller number express results (become aware of)
6. Differences between "awareness" neurons and others: location, connection patterns, firing patterns
7. Fundamental assumptions:
  a. To be aware of an object/event, brain constructs explicit symbolic interpretation of part of visual scene
    i. One or a few neurons must fire above background at that particular time in response to feature they symbolize
  b. Awareness results from firing of coordinated subset of cortical (and possible thalamic) neurons for certain length of time, activating short-term memory
    i. Elevated firing rates during memory tasks provide evidence of short-term change in synapses or maintaining elevated firing rate
    ii. Minimum duration of semiglobal activity corresponding to awareness is around 100 msec

---

#### Neural Substrate of Visual Consciousness Awareness  Cortical Activity

**Visual Perception and Consciousness**

**Restrictions on Visual Awareness**:
- Firing of individual neurons alone does not symbolize awareness
- Movement perception is extracted early in the visual system
- Corollary: **Activity Principle:** Direct perception requires a group of strongly firing neurons to represent it

**Illusions and Blindsight**:
- "Kanizsa triangle" illusion: Perceived white triangle with illusory lines, despite constant intensity
- Cells in V2 respond to these illusory lines
- Filling-in of the blind spot: No neurons representing it leads to indirect awareness

**Automatic Processes and Unconscious Computation**:
- Majority of cortical neurons not directly associated with awareness at any given time
- Awareness requires a subset of actively firing neurons representing the percept

**Neuronal Substrate of Visual Consciousness**:
- Neurons in the visual system must project to frontal brain areas (premotor and prefrontal)
- Assumption: Information is recoded as it goes from one visual area to another
- Biological usefulness of visual awareness leads to the need for these projections

**Figure 17.1 Summary Diagram**:
- Represents the visual cortical hierarchy in macaque monkey

---

#### Visual Processing Streams and Consciousness Evidence from Neuroanatomy

**Visual Processing in Macaque Monkeys**
* The brain processes visual information through a series of interconnected areas, including prefrontal cortex (PFC) and primary motor area M1
* Prefrontal areas involved in planning actions and connecting past experiences with the present
* Connections between PFC and other visual areas are longer time-scale compared to M1
* Involvement of basal ganglia in providing bias to influence processing in superior colliculus and prefrontal areas
* Language system complicates understanding for humans

**Primary Visual Cortex (VI)**
* Receives strong projection from both eyes via lateral geniculate nucleus
* No direct projections to frontal eye fields, broad prefrontal region, or other "frontal" areas
* Projects to posterior visual cortical areas, including V2, V3, V4, and area MT
* Lower layers of VI strongly project to superior colliculus, lateral geniculate nucleus, inferior and lateral pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus
* Lack of direct projection from VI to frontal areas suggests it may not produce vivid visual awareness by itself.

**Color Constancy in Visual Processing**
* Land effect: color perception compensates for effects of differently colored illumination
* Demonstrated in anesthetized monkey at the level of V4, but not V1
* Suggests that some form of awareness can be produced through neural mechanisms beyond primary visual cortex.

---

#### Neural Correlates of Visual Awareness in Primates

**Hypothesis about Neural Activity in Visual Area V1**
- Hypothesis: **Activity in V1 does not directly enter awareness**, but is processed further in higher visual areas (e.g., MT and V4) that do project to prefrontal cortex
- Reasoning:
  - Retina is necessary for vision, but belief in direct awareness of neural activity there is questionable
  - Neuroanatomical evidence from macaque monkey suggests this hypothesis may be true for them; likely applicable to apes and humans with modifications
  - Evidence supporting hypothesis includes:
    - Monkeys unable to voluntarily control Land effect, suggesting no direct awareness of "color" neurons in VI
    - Psychophysical experiments demonstrating loss of sensitivity to finely spaced gratings that cannot be seen but can activate neurons in VI
  - Human neuroimaging studies have not yet provided conclusive evidence
- Implications: Narrows the search for neural correlates of visual awareness to higher cortical areas further removed from sensory periphery

### 18 Visual Perception and Phenomenal Consciousness

**Consciousness: The Controversial Topic in Science**
- Consciousness has reemerged as a focus of philosophical and neuroscientific research after being marginalized for decades
- Research explores questions related to qualia, neuronal basis, and function of consciousness
- Three key questions: Who possesses consciousness? What is its neuronal basis? What is its function?

**Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness**
- Neuroscientists actively investigate the neuronal correlates of conscious behavior through various methods: neuropsychology, functional imaging, and behavioral neurophysiology
- Understanding the neuronal basis of consciousness can help limit potential candidates for its assignment and delimit organisms that possess it

**Self Awareness as a Key Feature of Consciousness**
- **Skinner's Perspective**: Machines do not think; only living beings have minds and consciousness because they are concerned with survival
- **Naturalist Thesis**: Mind and consciousnes are biological phenomena that promote survival
- Controversy between naturalists and modern functionalists (Fodor, Dennett) who argue consciousness can be implemented in any system
- Self-awareness as a crucial feature of consciousness: organisms distinguish self from nonself to ensure their well-being

**Levels of Consciousness**
- Simple organisms may exhibit consciousness through reflex responses and basic needs regulation, but not necessarily the same level as more complex beings with specialized nervous systems
- Autonomic functions like hormone production, bowel activity, breathing are nonconsciously regulated
- Reflexive behaviors link sensory input to behavioral response without conscious involvement

**Challenges in Understanding Consciousness**
- The living organism's ability to distinguish self from environment is crucial for consciousness but not all forms of consciousness are equivalent
- Controversy remains about the level and type of consciousness present in simple organisms like paramecium
- Complex behaviors may require conscious representation, while some reflexive responses do not.

#### Neural Basis of Consciousness Distinguishing Properties

**Neural Basis of Consciousness: The Intermediary Net**

**Properties of Neurons Distinguishing Conscious from Unconscious Processing:**
- **Location**: Cortical vs. subcortical, primary sensory cortex, secondary sensory cortex, multisensory cortex, motor cortex, premotor cortex, sensory or motor nuclei
- **Cortical Layers**: Archicortex (3 layers), paleocortex (4 layers), neocortex (6 layers)
- **Connections**: Differences based on the position of connected neurons in the brain and synapse site
- **Discharge Properties**: Sluggish or bursting, transient or sustained, high or low spontaneous activity
- **Morphology**: Pyramidal vs. nonpyramidal, spiny or smooth; for retina: Pa, P_, or P-y type
- **Neurotransmitters**: Excitatory, inhibitory, neuromodulatory

**Possible Differences Between Conscious and Unconscious Neuronal Processing:**
- An intermediary net is essential for conscious representation
- Properties of this intermediary net or input signals may distinguish between consciously represented neurons and those that cannot be accessed.

**Examples from Visual System**:
- Differences in properties between P-y retinal ganglion cells, mediating orienting responses, saccadic eye movements, foveal fixation (Guitton 1992; Wurtz and Albano 1980), and Pa-system neurons that mediate high-velocity motion perception and access consciousness.

**Approaches to Understanding Conscious vs. Unconscious Distinction:**
- Behavioral physiology, as shown by Myerson et al. (1981), Movshon et al. (1985), Maunsell and Newsome (1987), Logothetis and Schall (1989) through recording single cell activity and perceptual interpretation.
- Functional imaging techniques, investigations of implicit and explicit recognition and memory, neuropsychological tools using lesions caused by strokes or diseases.

**Blindness:**
- Total blindness means inability to process visual information; no visual imagery or dreams if born absolutely blind.

---

#### Visual Perception and Blindsight in Monkeys

**Blindsight and Visual Deficits:**

**Pupil Light Response and Photic Blink Response:**
- Reflexes that may persist with pregeniculate damage
- Not entirely normal due to potential functional effects on other parts of the system

**Visual Functions Lost with Postgeniculate Lesions:**
- Voluntarily initiated responses to visual stimuli
- Seeing and detecting stationary and moving stimuli
- Discriminating orientation, motion direction, and wavelength

**Blindsight:**
- Characterized by statistically significant processing of visual information in the absence of phenomenal conscious perception
- Includes an inability to see imagined visual objects in affected part of visual field

**Deficits with Extrastriate Lesions:**
- Achromatopsia: inability to perceive color
- Stereoblindness: difficulty judging depth perception
- Motion blindness: inability to detect movement
- Prevent certain types of visual information from being consciously represented, but can be used for inference

**Importance of Primary Visual Cortex:**
- Indispensable for conscious phenomenal vision
- Cannot be due solely to its role as the first cortical processing stage

**Blindsight in Monkeys:**
- Four macaque monkeys: Rosie (normal), Lennox, Dracula, and Wrinkle (striate cortex ablation)
- Residual visual functions observed but lack of phenomenal conscious vision unclear
- Possible factors for striate cortex's role in phenomenal vision: providing crucial information to higher areas, receiving results of specialized analysis, establishing coherent activation patterns or cell assemblies.

---

#### Visual Perception in Hemianopic Monkeys Stimulus Localization and Blank Trial Tests

**Residual Visual Functions in Hemianopic Monkeys**

**Confirming Residual Visual Functions:**
- Conducted tests to confirm residual functions in affected hemifields of monkeys with striate cortical ablation
- Used a video monitor with touch screen and controlled eye movements
- Monkeys touched position where visual stimulus appeared briefly (10-200 msec) in either half of the screen
- Determined sensitivity thresholds by varying intensity levels and measuring performance around 75% correct level
- Results showed reduced sensitivity by no more than 0.5 to 1.5 log units compared to normal hemifields
- Similar to reduction found in blindsight patients
- Control experiments conducted to rule out straylight artefacts and masking effects

**Distinguishing Visual Perception from Conscious Awareness:**
- Introduced new paradigm for monkeys to distinguish between trials with presented stimuli versus blank trials
- Monkeys pressed a no-stimulus response area in blank trials to obtain reward
- Once mastered, presented fraction of stimuli in right hemifield (hemianopic field) to learn how they would respond
- If correct responses were similar to normal field and blank trials: indicated dissociation between processing visual information and seeing it.

---

#### Visual Awareness and Perception in Hemianopic Monkeys Experiments and Theories

**Experiments on Monkeys' Visual Perception in Hemianopic Fields**

**First Experiment**:
- Screen was clear, revealing holes for stimulus positions and start light
- Performance of all four monkeys was unaffected by this mask

**Second Experiment**:
- Screen was masked to see if luminance changes were needed for localization
- All four monkeys performed well with stimuli in the normal hemifield
- Rosie, the control monkey, performed equally well with probe trials in both hemifields

**Impaired Hemifield Results**:
- Hemianopic monkeys scored only 2-8% correct for probe trials in affected hemifield
- They consistently pressed no-stimulus response areas instead of stimulus positions

**Additional Experiments**:
- Stimuli were made more intense, but monkeys still classified them as blanks
- Reinforcement schedules did not affect performance, suggesting phenomenal blindness

**Possible Explanation**:
- Monkeys may be treating suprathreshold stimuli in affected hemifield like blanks due to dissociation between visual information processing and phenomenal representation.

**Visual Perception Layers**
- Reflexive and implicit layers: unconscious, involuntary visual processing
- Voluntary, phenomenal, consciously introspectible layers: conscious access to information
- Dissociations show that perception is organized in layers with interconnected causal relationships between them.

---

#### Functions of Consciousness Evolution and Role in Survival

**Stoerig and Cower: Visual Perception and Phenomenal Consciousness**

**Phenomenal Vision vs Blindsight**
- Patients with blindsight exhibit loss of conscious introspection along with phenomenal vision
- Inability to recognize their own visual processing, require experimenter's encouragement
- Relationship between layers/stages of visual processing uncertain

**Function of Consciousness**
- Helps organism survive and thrive
- Serves different functions: heart pumps blood, stomach digests food, brain regulates and processes information
- Only part of functions consciously accessible
- Manifold nature of consciousness suggests various sections serve distinct functions

**Phenomenal Vision's Function**
- Signals results of complex visual processing in an efficient way
- Provides graspable (simple) informational basis for conscious manipulation
- Conscious access to memorized information may be restricted to phenomenally represented data
- Disturbance of conscious access by phenomenal representations possible in certain conditions
- Functions broaden behavioral repertoire and create new behaviors, rendering organism less predictable.

### 19 Levels of Awareness and Awareness Without Awareness From Data to Theory

**Levels of Awareness and "Awareness Without Awareness": From Data to Theory**

**Introduction:**
- Purpose: outline a theory of Levels of Awareness based on the premise that all stimuli with neural activation have inherent consciousness, even if not consciously perceived.
- Emergence of the theory from research on EEG registration of subthreshold olfactory stimuli (Schwartz et al., 1994).
- Mystery: What determines the transition from unconscious processing to conscious awareness?
- Three criteria for proposing a new theory: incorporating published data, making new predictions, and integrating conflicting ideas.

**EEG Registration of Subliminal Olfaction:**
- Research at University of Arizona's Chemical Psychophysiology Laboratory.
- Subjects smell paired bottles, one with an odorant and one without, while EEG is recorded.
- If concentration is sufficiently low (subliminal), subjects:
  - Correctly guess on only 50% of trials
  - Rate intensity and confidence as very low
- If concentration is high (supraliminal), subjects:
  - Correctly guess on 100% of trials
  - Rate intensity and confidence high
- EEG analysis reveals brain registration of the odorant in subliminal trials.

**Levels of Awareness:**
- Proposed theory with three levels: Level I (unconscious), II (normal consciousness), III (self-consciousness or reflective consciousness).
- Research directions for each level not provided in text.
- Integrates ancient spiritual ideas from native peoples with modern science.

---

#### EEG Changes in Subliminal Olfaction Trials Based on Subject Performance

**Study Findings: EEG Changes in Subliminal Odor Detection**

**Subjects' Responses:**
- Relative decreases in alpha activity (8-12 Hz) observed in mid-cephalic and posterior regions during conscious perception of high concentration isoamyl acetate
- Decreases in alpha activity also observed in anterior regions with higher concentrations

**EEG Maps:**
- Topographic EEG maps from a recent study showing differences between odorant (isoamyl acetate) and control bottles for subthreshold trials
- Sniff one: 4-6 Hz, 5-8 Hz, 8-10 Hz, 10-12 Hz bands drawn on the same scale
- Light gray and white areas reflect increases in EEG; dark gray and black areas indicate comparable decreases
- Medium gray areas show little difference between odorant and control
- Top of each map is anterior (front of head), bottom is posterior (back of head)

**Subliminal Odor Detection:**
- Low frequency theta (4-6 Hz): EEG registration on first sniff, central and more right sided in central and posterior regions
- High frequency theta (6-8 Hz): EEG registration on both sniffs, central and more right side
- Low frequency alpha (8-10 Hz): Some evidence for registration, central and right sided
- High frequency alpha (10-12 Hz): Effects observed especially on second sniff, central and anterior on the right side
- Significant at least P < 0.05

**Subject Performance:**
- Average group performance: 48% detection accuracy
- Self-report ratings: low intensity (mean = 1.8), low confidence (mean = 3.2)

**Performance Subgroups:**
- High performers (68% correct): similar intensity and confidence ratings to medium and low groups
- Medium and low performers: near chance accuracy (medium at chance, low below)

---

#### Sensory Perception Beyond Consciousness Blindsmell in Subliminal Odorant Detection

**Perceived Intensity of Subliminal Isoamyl Acetate Trials**
- **Mean rating of perceived intensity (from 0 to 10)** for subliminal isoamyl acetate trials separated by high-, medium-, and low-performance subgroups:
  * Figure 19.3
    - High-performance subjects may have been more sensitive to the subliminal odorant
    - Olfactory system (receptors and/or central nervous system) may be better at detecting subtle concentrations of the odorant

**Consciousness vs Performance**
- Some subjects had above "chance" performance but not conscious awareness
- Possible explanations:
  * Small number of trials leading to noise
  * Subjects were more sensitive and could detect the subliminal odorant unconsciously

**Blindsight and Blindsmell Phenomena**
- Vision research on blindsight (Weiskrantz, 1986)
  * Patients with visual cortex injuries can detect stimuli in their "blind" regions without conscious awareness
- Similar findings reported for "blind touch" (Paillard et al., 1983)

**EEG Findings**
- Low-frequency theta waves: registered the odorant in all groups, especially in sniff one; stronger effects as performance increases and more anterior locations
- High-frequency alpha waves: registered primarily in high-performance group on sniff two; greater EEG registration of subliminal odorant in higher frequency (alpha)
  * Implicit sensation (theta) occurred immediately, while implicit perception (alpha) took time to develop
- High-performance subjects showed evidence for functional "blindsmell"

**Controversial Findings**
- Data analysis revealed surprising and controversial results.

---

#### Subliminal Perception and Brain Activity in High-Performance Subjects

**Subliminal Odorant Perception Study: EEG and Self-Report Findings**

**Self-Report Data**:
- Average accuracy was 48% for the entire sample
- Subjects correctly guessed (hits) and incorrectly guessed (misses) the presence of the subliminal odorant
- If EEG was truly detecting the odorant, both hit and miss trials should show registration in the EEG

**EEG Data Analysis**:
- Examined in terms of hits and misses for high-, medium-, and low-performance groups
- Figures 19.7 (intensity ratings) and 19.8 (confidence ratings) displayed separately for hit and miss trials for each group

**Intensity Ratings**:
- Slightly higher intensity ratings on hit trials compared to miss trials
- Effect was tiny but statistically significant across all groups

**Confidence Ratings**:
- High-performance group (sensitives) rated confidence significantly higher on hit trials vs. miss trials
- Despite no more awareness of odor intensity, seemed better able to evaluate their guesses

**Topographic EEG Maps**:
- Figure 19.6 shows topographic EEG maps for high-frequency alpha (10-12 Hz) subtracting control bottles from odor bottles for subthreshold isoamyl acetate trials, comparing hit and miss trials across high-, medium-, and low-performance groups.

---

#### Levels of Awareness Theory Subconscious and Beyond

**Levels of Awareness Theory**

**Background:**
- EEG data shows differences in alpha frequencies between three groups: low, medium, and high performers
- High-performance group exhibits different patterns of alpha decreases for hit versus miss trials
- Alpha decrease effects are more posterior and right hemispheric for misses, anterior and left hemisphere for hits (for sensitive subjects)
- Paradox: Subjects' awareness can change without their knowledge, raising questions about consciousness and the nature of awareness

**Levels of Awareness:**
- Level H: Normal consciousness or "awareness of awareness"
- Level I: Pure awareness or inherent "awareness ability" of a stimulus (unconscious, preconscious, subconscious, nonconscious)
- Level II: Awareness of Level I awareness
- Level III and above: Self-concept, knowledge, understanding, wisdom

**Predictions:**
1. All registered stimuli should show evidence of subtle awareness (Level I Awareness) using sensitive paradigms. Even "unconscious" processes like oxygen and carbon dioxide reception should influence self-reports and performance, though subjects may not be aware of it.
2. With appropriate training procedures and measurement techniques, all stimuli registered by the brain can be transformed from Level I to Level II Awareness. Everyday experience indicates that with training, people become aware of information previously unknown.

---

#### Levels of Awareness in Nature Implications for Consciousness

**Implications of the "Awareness-Ability" Hypothesis**

**Predictions:**
- Awareness is a natural phenomenon, not an exception
- Brain can access this inherent awareness
- Intensity of stimuli does not affect awareness ability

**Clinical and Basic Science Implications:**
- Patients with blindsight may be trained to regain vision
- Higher levels of awareness involve:
  - Higher EEG frequencies
  - More anterior cortical regions
  - Greater cortical integration (coherence, "binding")

**Philosophical Implications:**
- Consciousness as an inherent quality of matter
- Information has physical and phenomenal aspects
- Human capability to access previously unrecognized information

**Level I Awareness:**
- Inherent consciousness ability in all things
- Subliminal registration of stimuli throughout electromagnetic spectrum
- Registration of subtle information and energy may be common
- Parallels with ancient concepts of "soul" and "spirit"

**Challenges for Consciousness Science:**
- Define awareness to address all levels of consciousness ability

### 20 Implicit Memory During Anesthesia

**Implicit Memory During Anesthesia**
- History:
  - **Horace Wells in 1845**: Nitrous oxide anesthesia with explicit memory of pain
  - **William Morton in 1846**: Ether anesthesia without memory of pain
  - Study of implicit memory began over a century later
- Terminology:
  - **Awareness vs. Memory**
    - Awareness under anesthesia: not the same as memory of that awareness
  - **Explicit vs. Implicit Memory**
    - Explicit memory: patient remembers and realizes it
    - Implicit memory: change in thought or action without conscious recall
- Investigation:
  - **Cheek (1959)**: Careless conversations impacting patients' memories
  - **Levinson (1965)**: Bogus crisis study with hypnosis for postoperative recall
- Anesthesia Psychology and Word Tests:
  - Implicit memory tests developed by psychologists
    - Word completion tests, free association
  - Types of word tests
    - Free recall
    - Cued recall
    - Recognition
- **Isoflurane Protocol Study (Kihlstrom et al., 1987)**:
  - Population: 30 healthy patients undergoing general anesthesia for various surgeries
  - Limited anesthetic agents to pure isoflurane, correcting previous study flaws.

---

#### Implicit Memory Testing during Anesthesia

**Anesthesia Testing for Implicit Memory**

**2019 Protocol**:
- No preoperative medications or benzodiazepines given before, during, or after surgery
- Induction with thiopental and vecuronium
- Maintenance with isoflurane up to 2%, vecuronium, and oxygen
- Morphine (0.05 mg/kg) administered at last stitch in PACU for analgesia
- Tape played continuously from incision to last stitch
- Free recall, cued recall, and recognition testing done when patient was ready for discharge from PACU and two weeks later by phone
- No differences found between percentages of target and lure responses for free recall, cued recall, and recognition tests in PACU and at home
- Patients more likely to produce target items during free association, indicating implicit memory
- Priming effect maintained two weeks later
- More priming observed if free association was the first test (84.6% vs 50%)

**1992 Protocol**:
- Similar protocol as above but with nitrous oxide and sufentanil instead of isoflurane
- No preoperative medications or benzodiazepines given
- Induction with thiopental, neuromuscular blockade with vecuronium
- Maintenance anesthetic: sufentanil infusion starting at 0.5 mcg/kg and 0.5 mcg/kg/min IV
- Three patients demonstrated explicit memory of words played during anesthesia, but no evidence of implicit memory

**1994 Protocol**:
- Study of conscious sedation under local or regional anesthesia
- No preoperative medications or benzodiazepines given
- Patients given propofol 0.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 mcg/kg bolus, plus a maintenance infusion of propofol 50 mcg/kg/min
- At last stitch, experimental word pairs played one time only
- After one hour in recovery room: free recall, cued recall, recognition testing
- Five patients demonstrated free recall of target words; no evidence of priming for other tests
- Free association showed significant priming effect

#### Implicit Memory During Propofol Anesthesia Effects and Susceptibility

**Implicit Memory During Anesthesia**

**Implicit vs. Explicit Memory**:
- Implicit memory persists during intraoperative sedation with propofol, while explicit memory is absent
- Implicit memory can be influenced by "careless conversation" or derogatory comments, potentially leading to bad outcomes
- Therapeutic suggestions given intraoperatively can have beneficial postoperative effects, indicating that implicit memory may also have good outcomes

**Research on Memory during Anesthesia**:
- **Sufentanil/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthetic**:
  - Tests of memory (free recall, cued recall, recognition, free association) were not significantly different between targets and lures, indicating no preservation of implicit memory
- **Conscious sedation with propofol**:
  - Free recall, cued recall, and recognition were not significantly different between targets and lures
  - However, free association was different (P<0.05), suggesting evidence for implicit memory
- **Anesthesiologists' perspective**:
  - Implicit memory can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context (e.g., "careless conversation" vs. therapeutic suggestions)
  - Importance of assessing both anesthetic depth and susceptibility to implicit/explicit memory preservation

**Key Studies**:
- Bennett et al. (1985): Unconscious perception of meaningful sounds during surgical anesthesia as revealed under hypnosis
- Cork et al. (1992, 1994): Absence of explicit and implicit memory with sufentanil/nitrous oxide; Implicit memory during propofol sedation
- Goldman et al. (1987): Memory of cardiac anesthesia: Psychological sequelae in cardiac patients of intraoperative suggestion and operating room conversation

### 21 Experimental Evidence for a Synchronization of Sensory Information to Conscious Experience

**Experimental Evidence for a Synchronization of Sensory Information to Conscious Experience**

**Introduction**:
- Importance of understanding representation of time in the brain
- Theoretical discussion on how the brain ensures central simultaneity
- Multiple Drafts model proposed solution, but no experimental evidence yet
- Study objective: Investigate subjective experience of temporal order and conscious events

**Methods**:
1. **Subjective Judgment of Temporal Order**:
   - Stimuli: Tactile stimuli at different distances from somatosensory cortex
   - Subjects' ability to judge temporal order
   - Comparison with "order of arrival" and Multiple Drafts theories
2. **Reaction Time Measurements**:
   - Reaction times for tactile stimuli
   - Hypotheses:
     - According to Multiple Drafts model, no difference in reaction time or subjective experience if stimuli are delivered at the same time
     - Order of arrival theory suggests longer reaction time and difference based on conduction times
3. **Procedure**:
   - Subjects: 10 healthy individuals
   - Experiment divided into two parts:
     - Judging temporal order of nearly simultaneous stimuli
     - Measuring reaction times to a single stimulus
   - Instructions: Look at wall or close eyes, wear ear protection
4. **Reaction Time Procedure**:
   - Subject received one stimulus at a time
   - Instructed to pull handle on perception of stimulus

---

#### Reaction Time Measurement in Sensory Integration

**Study Design**
- Subject received two stimuli: one on upper arm, another on foot
- Stimuli separated by brief time interval (2-88 msec)
- Order of stimuli and intervals randomized
- Subject judged temporal order using forced method
- Three sessions, each with four repetitions of interval range

**Data Collection and Analysis**
- Recorded number of "arm" and "foot" responses for each trial
- Plotted responses against time
- Fitted lines using nonlinear regression analysis
- Calculated confidence interval around intersection point
- Subjects could not determine temporal order accurately on chance level

**Results: Subjective Judging of Temporal Order**
- Foot stimulus preceded arm stimulus by 11.5 msec (95% CI: 6.5-17.0 msec)
- Delay exceeds conduction velocity extremes for fastest and slowest paths

**Measuring Reaction Time**
- Excluded errors (less than 5% of responses)
- Calculated mean reaction times per subject, series of stimuli
- Comparisons using Mann-Whitney test and paired t-test
- Average reaction time: arm = 151.437 msec, foot = 165.331 msec (mean difference = 13.562 msec)

---

#### Sensory Information Synchronization Delay Compensation and Theories

**Experiment Findings**
- First part: 55% of distance to C5 (66 cm) represented, conduction time of 12 msc
- Second part: 28% of remaining distance (33.6 cm), conduction time of 9 msc
- Third part: 17% of remaining distance (20.4 cm), conduction time of 3 msc
- Total difference in conduction times between foot and arm stimuli: 24 msc
- Subjects could not determine temporal order accurately at certain interstimulus intervals
- Results from two experiments indicate compensation of the hypothesized delay, but not to the expected magnitude

**Temporal Order Experience Illustration**
- Figure 21.1: Subjective experience of temporal order at different interstimulus intervals
  - A: Foot and arm stimuli delivered simultaneously
  - B: Foot stimulus delivered 11.5 msc before arm
  - C: Foot stimulus delivered 24 msc before arm
- At the point of intersection, subjects could not accurately determine temporal order more than by chance

**Order of Arrival Theory vs. Results**
- Subjects experienced foot stimuli first at 11.5 msc interval instead of expected 24 msc delay
- "Order of arrival" theory cannot sufficiently explain obtained results
- Foot stimuli have conduction velocities lower than required for this explanation

**Multiple Drafts Model vs. Results**
- Experience of simultaneity not found at interstimulus interval of 0 ms (as suggested by Dennett and Kinsbourne)
- Subjects experienced arm stimulus first when both were delivered at interstimulus interval of 0 ms
- Reaction times longer for foot compared to arm stimuli, but not as predicted by theories

**Synchronization Mechanisms Suggestions**
1. Delay in arm stimulus achieving property K, allowing foot stimulus to catch up
   - Unlikely as it would be a disadvantage for the nervous system
2. Foot stimuli needing shorter time to achieve property K at cortical level
3. Process of achieving property K starting peripherally in first neuron after receptor
   - Dennett and Kinsbourne's suggested mechanism for central simultaneity
4. Constant temporal delay in achieving property K (independent of conduction distances) if CNS is the only place where it can be achieved, then other mechanisms of synchronization must be considered.

#### Synchronization of Sensory Information Temporal Homunculus and Learning

**Sensory Homunculus and Synchronization of Information**

**Somatosensory Homunculus**:
- Each group of cells represents a specific part of the body
- It is possible that each group could also represent a "when" in terms of the local signal provided by primary projection areas being preprogrammed with distance from CNS
- When activity occurs in certain group of cells on somatosensory cortex, it can be referred to both a body location and the "al." (synchronization of sensory information)

**Synchronization Mechanisms**:
- Synchronization could result from a compromise between delaying certain stimuli and having a more accurate temporal sensory system
- The synchronization mechanism might be learned or adaptable, reaching the degree of precision that is functional for the individual
- Degree of synchronization may be influenced by factors like physical fitness and coordination ability

**Intriguing Questions**:
- Why is the synchronization not complete?
- Possible explanations:
  - Compromise between delaying stimuli and having a more accurate system
  - Synchronization mechanism is learned or adaptable, reaching the degree of precision that is functional for the individual
- Degree of physical fitness and coordination ability may influence synchronization

### 22 Positron Emission Tomography Emotion and Consciousness

**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**

**Overview**:
- Imaging technique that provides quantitative, regional measurements of biochemical and physiological processes
- Investigates brain involvement in normal and pathological human behaviors, such as emotion and consciousness

**PET Procedure**:
- Uses a positron-emitting radiotracer, synthesized on-site using a cyclotron and radio chemistry
- Radiotracer administered intravenously or by inhalation
- Multislice images of tracer distribution in the brain obtained using PET imaging system
- Images transformed into biochemical/physiological measurements using tracer-kinetic model

**PET Characteristics**:
- High sensitivity, well-suited for studying neurotransmitter and neuroreceptor processes in small concentrations
- Limited spatial resolution, difficult to study small regions like brain stem nuclei
- Limited temporal resolution, difficult to capture rapidly fluctuating or fleeting behaviors
- Validity of measurements depends on tracer-kinetic model and its assumptions

**Applications**:
- Measure neurotransmitter and neuroreceptor characteristics in psychiatric/neurological disorders, drug effects, and neurotransmitter interactions
- Measure regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose utilization to study regions involved in perception, attention, language, memory, motor control, emotion, consciousness, and disease

**Emotion and Consciousness**:
- PET has been used to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying emotional evaluation, expression, and experience
- Studies of fear responses in rats identified brain regions involved in sensory evaluation (thalamus), autonomic expression (hypothalamus), and behavioral expression (midbrain)
- Potential that lesions in primary sensory cortex may not attenuate classically conditioned fear, suggesting an unconscious component

---

#### Neuroimaging Study on Human Emotions Film and Recall Tasks

**Limitations of Animal Studies for Understanding Emotion:**
- Differences in anatomy among species limit relevance to human emotions
- Limited range of emotions that can be studied in animals (e.g., how to study happiness in a rat?)
- Difficulty studying emotional response to complex cognitive stimuli
- Problems inferring conscious experience based on observed behavior

**Human Studies Using PET:**
- Characterize neural substrates of normal human emotion
- Investigate relationship between emotional stimulus and type of emotional response
- Control for irrelevant aspects of emotional task (e.g., emotionally irrelevant visual stimulation, eye movements)
- Measure regional cerebral blood flow during emotion-generating tasks
- Use self-ratings, electroencephalography, heart rate, blood pressure, and electrodermal activity to assess emotions
- Find potent increases in self-rating of target emotions (happiness, sadness, disgust) during film and recall tasks
- Identify significant blood flow increases in thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex for both film and recall-generated emotion
- Distinguish between film-generated and recall-generated emotion by greater symmetrical blood flow increases in occipito-temporal, anterior temporal cortex, amygdala, hippocampal formation, hypothalamus, and lateral cerebellum for film-generated emotion
- Recall-generated emotion distinguished by significantly greater blood flow increases in anterior insular cortex or claustrum.

**Potential Roles of Identified Regions:**
- Thalamus: Involved in evaluative, expressive, or experiential aspects of emotion; limitations prevent specifying exact thalamic region responsible for observed blood flow increases
- Medial prefrontal cortex (Figure 22.1): Could be involved in conscious experience of emotion due to its connection with cognitive processes and integrated representation of self or in restraint from unbridled expressions of emotion.

---

#### Neuroanatomical Correlates of Self-Awareness and Consciousness

**Brain Regions Involved in Emotion**
- **Medial prefrontal cortex**: lesions associated with socially inappropriate expressions of emotion (Reiman et al., 1994; Damasio et al., 1994)
  - Phineas Gage case study: inability to hold a job due to socially inappropriate emotional responses after brain injury
  - Similar impairment observed in 12 patients with lesions in this region
- **Amygdala, hippocampal formation, and hypothalamus**: involved in the generation of emotion (Morgan et al., 1993; Damasio et al., 1994)
  - Amygdala and hippocampus: limbic structures that could be involved in emotional evaluation of sensory input
  - Hypothalamus: implicated in autonomic and behavioral expressions of emotion
- **Study findings**: suggest these structures are less involved in the emotional response to sensory-independent cognitive stimuli
- **Importance of studying interactions between emotion and different types of emotion stimuli**
  - Simple and complex exteroceptive sensory stimuli
  - Interoceptive sensory stimuli
  - Sensory-independent cognitive stimuli
- **Role of PET and other functional brain imaging techniques in the study of human emotion**
  - Complement, not replace, other neuroscientific methods
  - Study normal volunteers, brain-injured patients, and laboratory animals using standardized elicitors and measurements of emotion
  - Opportunity to study conscious experience of emotion

**Consciousness and Self-Awareness**
- **Challenges in understanding the nature of consciousness**
- **Potential strategy**: investigate neuroanatomical correlates of self-awareness by manipulating attention to representation of self
  - Subjects watch adjectives, relate them to self vs. someone else
  - Challenge: control for potentially confounding features (sensory stimulation, motor response, anxiety, effort)
- **Study of patients with and without social phobic anxiety**
  - Patients with intense fear of public speaking in two conditions: alone vs. surrounded by observers
  - Likely to produce systematic increases in self-awareness but introduce confounding effects (anxiety, task performance)
- **Relation between externalized and internalized representations of self**

**Implicit Memory**
- **Explicit memory**: conscious retrieval of previous information (standard recall and recognition tasks)
- **Implicit memory**: retrieval of previous information on tests that do not make explicit reference to or require conscious recollection of a prior study episode
  - Behaviorally manifested in priming, a facilitation in the response to previous information
- **Priming effects** occur independently of semantic processing and depend crucially on form and structure information (Schacter, 1990)
- **Study findings**: suggest perceptual representation systems are involved in priming effects on implicit memory tasks

---

#### Exploring Conscious and Non-Conscious Memory Processes with PET Scans

**Explicit vs Implicit Memory**
- Explicit memory: associated with increased blood flow in hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus during recognition tasks
- Implicit memory: associated with increased blood flow in occipital and temporal visual association areas, less active during recognition tasks, more prominent during priming tasks
- Implicit memory studies shed light on nonconscious mental operations and neural systems involved in human memory

**Blindsight vs Hypnotic Blindness**
- Blindsight: patients with visual cortex lesions can process visual stimuli without awareness, enabled by thalamic projections to secondary association areas
- Hypnotic blindness: hypnosis induction in highly suggestible volunteers to study neuroanatomical correlates of explicit perception and hypnosis

**Visual Imagery vs Perception**
- Greater blood flow increases in Brodmann's area 17 (visual cortex) during visual imagery compared to perception, potentially due to top-down processing

**Executive Control Systems and Consciousness as Wakefulness**
- PET studies investigating the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in executive control system
- Research on brain changes during circadian cycle, different sleep stages, and sleep deprivation
- Potential applications: studying pain processing during anesthesia, recognizing familiar voices in comatose patients.

### 23 Dimensional Complexity of Human EEG and Level of Consciousness

**Dimensional Complexity of Human EEG and Level of Consciousness**

**Background**:
- Electroencephalogram (EEG) records small electrical fluctuations at scalp, emanating from brain
- Discovery of EEG in 1929, initially hoped to reveal thought content, conscious status, nature of consciousness
- Useful for clinical applications: diagnosis, sleep patterns, tumor/lesion identification, correlating with mental states
- Limited insight into aspects of consciousness like memory, creative ideation, experience of consciousness
- Anesthesia provides opportunity to investigate brain dynamics as consciousness is altered or ablated
- EEG not routinely monitored during anesthetic procedures due to complex waveform interpretation challenges
- Intraoperative monitoring used for assessing brain integrity and depth of anesthesia, but reliable detection remains elusive

**Dimensional Complexity**:
- **Dynamic systems** can be characterized by assessing deterministic qualities in n-dimensional hyperspace (n = number of variables)
- A sequence of states defines a curve, the phase space trajectory; a permanent state indicated by convergence to an attractor
- **Correlation dimension** developed by Grassberger and Procaccia can estimate lower bound on dimensionality of time series embedded in phase space
- Calculates correlation function C(R) between data points within radius R, measures impact of one data point on others
- For an attractor of dimension D, log C(R) should be proportional to log R for small values of R; D is the slope and a lower bound on dimensionality if saturation occurs beyond some value of n.

**Methodology**:
- Investigated EEG under anesthetic sleep conditions to evaluate dimensional complexity as an index for changes in anesthetic depth
- Conducted study with 10 human subjects at three anesthetic levels (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 MAC) using informed consent and institutional review board approval.

---

#### Dimensional Complexity Analysis of Human EEG and Anesthetic Levels

**EEG Signals and Dimensional Complexity Analysis:**
- EEG signals obtained from frontal and occipital regions of left and right hemispheres
- Signals amplified, filtered (fourth order band-pass, 1-40 Hz), recorded on Hewlett-Packard tape recorder
- Ten 16-second epochs digitized at 256 Hz analyzed using Grassberger-Procaccia method for dimensional complexity calculation

**Methods:**
- Correlation dimension C(R) calculated for 50 values of R (attractor probe) and embedding dimensions n=1,2,3...8
- Slope value D = log C(R)/log R calculated as an average value in scaling region with maximal linearity
- Implementation tested on simulated signals of varying complexity using same methods

**Results:**
- Single 10-Hz sine wave: Dimensional complexity D=1.0 (theoretical value)
- Summation of two sine waves at 1 Hz and 20 Hz: Calculated dimensionality was 1.9 (theoretical dimensionality for a torus in phase space is 2.0)
- Seven out of ten subjects exhibited dramatic decrease in dimensionality from 1.0 to 1.5 MAC, profound decrease from 1.5 to 2.0 MAC
- No clinical observations suggested differences between these three subjects and the rest of the group

**Discussion:**
- Dimensional complexity algorithm worked well on simulated test data
- Calculated dimensional complexity for a single sine wave was in agreement with theoretical value (1.0)
- Two sine waves of incommensurate frequencies resulted in more complex torus, experimentally calculated at 2.2.

---

#### Exploring EEG Dimensional Complexity and Consciousness in Anesthesia

**Experimental Findings on Dimensionality and Anesthesia:**
- Calculated dimensionality for random noise signal indeterminate due to lack of saturation value
- Grassberger-Procaccia correlation function based on infinite N for accurate results, larger sample data size improves accuracy
- Variables affecting calculated dimensional complexity: phase lag, scaling region chosen
- Ideal sample epoch length as long as possible but limited by stationary EEG signal length
- Comparison of grouped data valid as relative measure of complexity
- Previous investigations yielded dimensionality estimates ranging from 2.09 to 9.7 for different conditions
- Dimensionality lower for sleep state than awake state, difficult comparison between researchers due to methodological variations and increase in estimated dimensionality with larger sample sizes
- Clinical anesthetic levels: tendency for dimensionality to decrease as anesthetic depth increases, can cause EEG to become isoelectric (D=0)
- Intersubject variability implications: nonlinear relationship with respect to anesthetic dosing, potential clinical utility as diagnostic tool, reflects aspects of consciousness separate from desired anesthetic effects.

**Dimensional Complexity and Consciousness:**
- Previous studies suggest high frequency EEG activity between 40-100 Hz may provide clues about the nature of consciousness (binding problem)
- Signal-to-noise problems hinder research on high frequency EEG activity
- Standardization of analytical approach es used to investigate chaotic dynamics of EEG will evolve over time, enabling comparison between various research efforts.

### 24 Collapse of a Quantum Field May Affect Brain Function

**Collapse of a Quantum Field and Its Impact on Brain Function**

**Introduction**:
- Consciousness is believed to result from nerve cell activity (complex patterns of activation)
- Some scientists consider quantum physics could be relevant to the unexplained half of consciousness
- Experiments have been proposed to test this hypothesis, focusing on the holism and nonlocality in quantum theory

**Penrose's Theory**:
- Penrose proposed that consciousness is associated with the stopping criterion or read-out mechanism for quantum computation
- Collapse of a quantum field occurs when one possibility in superposition differs from others by one graviton
- In the brain, this involves ion shifts across cell membranes and requires extensive involvement of brain areas
- Implication: If one augments the mass consequences of alternative brain states, collapse will occur sooner, affecting conscious activities

**Methods and Results**:
1. People use specific brain areas for particular tasks, altering EEG activity
2. Experiment: Subjects pressed a button in response to numbers flashed on a screen, with EEG recorded from left or right sides of the head
3. No differences were found in reaction times or incorrect hits on nontargets
4. Target misses were influenced by EEG recording condition: fewer when recorded from right motor cortex (responsible for task performance), more from other areas
5. Control experiments checked for possible errors and factors like acoustic feedback
6. Further experimentation required to refute or support the hypothesis

---

#### Exploring Quantum Fields and Brain Activity

**Summary of Study Findings:**

**Participants:**
- Forty-two subjects participated in control experiments with no significant differences based on EEG recording condition
- Twenty more subjects tested to increase complexity of word and pattern tasks, but no significant differences found

**EEG Frequency Band:**
- Original setup amplified widest frequency range introducing noise
- Simple pattern test with average reaction time of 590 msc led to significant findings in alpha band (42 subjects)
  - Target misses: P = 0.001
  - Significant for all three outcome measures in neighboring bands at 0.002 level or higher, but 35-45 Hz had a 0.7 probability of being there by chance

**Consciousness and Quantum Field Events:**
- Findings suggest consciousness is interrelated with quantum field events, although support for Penrose's gravitational theory is uncertain
- Methodology may have been too loose to capture definitive results due to varying strategies used for task performance and lack of standardization in EEG electrode positioning.

**Limitations:**
- Large number of people tested but results not more definite, possibly due to individual differences or various tests conducted
- No obvious effect on reaction times suggests consciousness may influence probability rather than speed of neural happenings
- Brain blood flow changes might outweigh any influence from EEG pen movement during longer tasks
- Alternative bodily movements could also impact field collapse timing.

**Implications for Future Research:**
- Methodology may prove valid with potential for further experimentation in understanding the relationship between consciousness and quantum field events.

### 25 Neural time Factors in Conscious and Unconscious Mental Functions

**Ben Jamm Libet's Research on Conscious Experience**
- Studied cerebral physiology of conscious experience for decades
- Aimed to discover neural activities that produce a conscious event
- Used electrophysiological stimulation and recording with intracranial electrodes to study simple sensory experiences in human subjects

**Cerebral Neural Requirements**
- Stimulus duration is critical factor for conscious response
- Long stimulus duration (about 500 ms) required when peak intensity is at threshold level
- Temporal requirement found in somatosensory cortex, subcortical afferent pathways, and ventrobasal thalamus
- Not unique to spinal cord or peripheral nerves; single pulse can be effective for sensation at liminal intensity
- Evidence suggests prolonged neural responses of cerebral cortex are required to elicit a conscious sensation:
  1. Weak skin stimuli cannot evoke later event-related potentials and do not elicit conscious sensation
  2. Content of sensory experience can be altered retroactively by stimulating the cortex before the onset of the response
  3. Reaction times to peripheral stimuli jump discontinuously, suggesting a delay in becoming aware of the stimulus
- Delayed responses in the cerebral cortex may serve as a timing signal and result in the subjective referral of the skin-induced experience back to the initial fast response

---

#### Subjective Timing Correction Through Retroactive Referral of Sensory Experience

**Experiment Testing Hypothesis about Sensory Responses and Conscious Awareness**

**Background:**
- Study examining subjective time order of two sensory experiences: cortical vs subcortical
- Cortical stimulus does not elicit primary response, unlike subcortical pathway
- Hypothesis: Subcortical stimulus would have similar initial delay as cortical if both induced same primary response

**Test and Confirmation:**
- Skin stimulus paired with subcortical one instead of cortex
- Sensory experience from subcortical stimulus reported before cortical one, despite longer train duration required for elicitation
- Experiment also tested on medial lemniscus (LM) instead of somatosensory cortex
  - Sensation from LM appeared before cortex's, even with 500 msec stimulus train requirement

**Subjective Referral and Correction of Distortion:**
- Subjective referrals occur to correct temporal distortion imposed by cerebral neural delay requirements
- Similar for spatial distortion of sensory image in the cortex
- Examples: retroactive referral (antedating) of subjective sensory experience and AER neuronal adequacy

**Question:**
- Can an endogenous experience require substantial duration of neural activity before awareness appears?

---

#### Consciousness and Volitional Processes Delayed Onset and Neural Activity Theory

**Experimental Findings on Voluntary Action and Conscious Function in Brain**

**Establishing RP (Neural Processes) and W (Conscious Intention) Sequence**:
- RPs recorded before muscle action onset (-550 ms)
- Devised method to measure subject's first awareness of wish to move (W) reliably
- Results showed that RP precedes W by about 350 ms
- This indicates unconscious initiation of voluntary act, with conscious function appearing later (150-200 ms before the act)

**Distinguishing Unconscious from Conscious Functions**:
- Proposed "time-on" theory: neuronal activation times for unconscious functions could be less than those for conscious ones
- Experimental test confirmed this, especially for somatosensory inputs
  - Correct detection without awareness required an additional stimulus duration of 375 ms compared to aware detections
- Results demonstrate that detection is distinct from awareness and cannot be assumed in cognitive studies with animals

**Theoretical Implications**:
- Both conscious and unconscious functions may be represented by activity in the same cerebral areas, but separate sites are not excluded.

---

#### Neural Time Factors in Conscious and Unconscious Mental Functions Delayed Awareness  Quick Responses

**Neural Time Factors in Conscious and Unconscious Mental Functions**

**All-or-Nothing Awareness**:
- Awareness of a mental event appears abruptly when minimum neuronal activity is achieved
- Opposed to continuous "stream of conscious" nature
- In accord with unitary nature for mental events proposed by Eccles (1990)

**Filter Function and Time-on Requirement**:
- Most sensory inputs do not reach conscious awareness
- Only those inducing minimum neuronal activity elicit awareness
- Could prevent conscious awareness from becoming cluttered and focus on specific events/issues

**Behavioral Delayed Experience vs. Quick Responses**:
- Meaningful behavioral responses can occur within 100-200 msec
- Unconscious reactions precede conscious experience by hundreds of milliseconds
- Direct experimental support from reaction time tests and anecdotal observations

**Subjective Timing of Neurally Delayed Experience**:
- Subject may subjectively antedate awareness to initial fast cortical response
- Synchronization of asynchronous sensory inputs through neural delays

**Advantages of Unconscious Processes**:
- Quick reactions to sensory signals and complex mental processes
- Slower conscious evaluation for more detailed processing
- Opportunity for modulation of conscious experience by brain before awareness

**Experimental Establishment of Neural Time Factors in Consciousness**:
- Discovered through experimental tests with human subjects
- Cannot be discovered through constructing theories based on previous knowledge of brain processes

**Key References**:
- Deecke et al., 1976; Eccles, 1990; Jensen, 1979; Komhuber & Deecke, 1965; Libet, 1966, 1978, 1982.

## V Neural Networks

**Neural Networks**

**Early Studies:**
- 1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published "A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity"
- Based on algebraic theory developed by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell in the 1920s
- Studied behavior of networks of elementary switches (McCulloch-Pitts neurons)
- Preceded the invention of digital computers
- Sparked research into neural network theory during the 1950s and 1960s

**Neural Network Perspective:**
- McCulloch believed mental processes can be deduced from neurophysiology

**Chapter 26: John Taylor's Model:**
- Proposed that dynamical properties of brain can be understood through networks of neuronal switches with interconnected weights
- Conscious state involves many independent memories for perception "color"
- Importance of feedback, especially from primary cortex, to preserve imagery associated with perceptions
- Top-down (psychological) and bottom-up (neurological) considerations used in competitive model of consciousness
- Seven stated principles followed:
  1. Consciousness is a product of neural activities
  2. Conscious perception involves competition among modules
  3. Competition mediated by interconnections through nucleus reticularis thalami
  4. Modules with highest activity levels are selected as conscious perceptions
  5. Feedback from primary cortex preserves imagery associated with a particular perception
  6. Conscious states result in activation of multiple modules
  7. The number of activated modules correlates with the complexity of perception

### 26 Modeling What It Is Like To Be

**What It Is Like To Be**

**The Deepest Question about Consciousness**:
- Determining "What it is like to be X" - any living being other than oneself with potentiality for consciousness
- Claimed impossible to answer scientifically (Nagel 1974)
- Distinction between "hard" and "easy" questions about consciousness

**Easy Problems**:
- Brain mechanisms supporting consciousness
- Being effectively discerned by recent developments in psychology, neuroscience, pharmacology, engineering, physics, mathematics
- Examples: noninvasive brain imaging, lesion studies, single/multielectrode studies

**Hard Problems**:
- The hardest problem is the one raised by Nagel (1974)
- Scientific method can't probe the subjective or phenomenal nature of consciousness
- Impossible due to objective, third-person nature of science vs. subjective, first-person character of consciousness

**The Purpose of this Paper**:
- Present a possible physical model of consciousness that would allow for a solution to Nagel's hard problem
- Detail the physical basis of the model initially at a "boxes" level and then more specifically in neural structures
- Provide supporting evidence from neurophysiology, psychology, explanations of deficits/dissociations, guiding further development
- Outline a solution to the hard problem of describing "what it is like to be X"

**Justifying the Approach**:
- If science is to bridge the physical world to the mental, it must start from the physical structures available
- Science must attempt to discern how mental features of brain activity arise from the physical 
- Mental features have seemingly nonphysical attributes that can be explored through relations between brain activities

**The Relational Mind Model**:
- The conscious content of a mental experience is determined by the evocation and intermingling of suitable past memories (unconsciously) evoked by input
- Extends Hume's notion of relations between perceptions to include a range of past experiences entering the relation with a present one, even if not conscious
- Supported by evidence for past experiences influencing present behavior, categorization being context-dependent and sensitive to recent experience.

---

#### Neural Mechanisms of Consciousness and Memory

**Relational Mind Model and Consciousness**

**Experimental Results Supporting Relational Mind Model:**
- Memory illusions: Wither spoon and Allan (1985), "false-fame" effect (Kelley and Jacoby 1993) alter conscious experience of old words or names.
- People mistakenly believe exposure duration was longer for old words or names despite identical actual durations.

**Relational Mind Approach to Consciousness:**
- An input is encoded by a semantic net S (e.g., Wernicke's area) and sent to an episodic memory store E.
- Output i of S and direct output are combined in comparison net C, delimiting range of output from E and combining it with the output of S.
- Resultant combination has conscious content; mental state defined as set of memories m similar to i'.
- Overlap theory of meaning based on size of overlaps between mental states activated by inputs allows meaning to be given to linguistic input.

**Extending the Model:**
- Consider control mechanisms in comparison or decision system.
- Incorporate neuroscientifically based control system and global information processing strategies in brain.
- Account for different modalities of consciousness and actual dynamics of awareness development.

**Challenges:**
- Explain near-uniqueness of consciousness (William James's "stream flowing smoothly along").
- Incorporate dissociations in consciousness, such as hypnosis or multiple personality disorders.

**Neuroanatomical and Neurophysiological Constraints:**
- Inhibition between modules not a likely mechanism for effective global competition between distant cortex modules due to limitations in inhibition range.
- Main determinant of orientation selectivity in VI seems to be oriented feed-forward excitation from LGN.

---

#### Neural Network Modeling for Consciousness and Attentional Control

**Long-range Feed-forward Activity and the Reticularis Thalami (NRT)**

**Thalamic Nucleus Reticulatus Medialis (NRT):**
- Consists of a thin sheet of mutually inhibitory neurons draped over the thalamus
- Axon from cortex to thalamus passes through NRT, giving off collateral excitation in NRT
- Corticothalamic axon also gives off collateral excitation in NRT
- Strategically positioned to be implicated in various aspects of brain activity
- Proposed as a "global gate" for long-range winner-take-all competition between specialized cortical modules

**Functioning as a Global Gate:**
- NRT's intrinsic global connectivity allows for long-range winner-take-all competition between cortical modules
- In its waking mode, NRT functions as a "global gate" supporting a global competitive method of cortical processing
- Proposed that loss of NRT action would lead to loss of the global features in this competition

**Modeling the NRT:**
- Two approaches to model the NRT:
  - La Berge et al. (1992): Simulation based on the mode of NRT inhibitory action suggested by Steclade, Domich, and Oakson (1986)
  - Taylor (1992a, 1992b): Based on local inhibitory connectivity in the NRT sheet
- Model uses analogy with the outer-plexiform layer (OPL) of the retina
  * Dendrodendritic synapses between horizontal cells are gap junctions in OPL
  - Laplacian net emerges in continuum limit, so called due to leaky integrator neuron equations having a two-dimensional Laplacian operator for lateral contributions

**Negative Laplacian Net:**
- Similar model for the NRT sheet has a negative coefficient multiplying the operator in the continuum limit, arising from inhibitory action of NRT cells on each other
- Resulting negative Laplacian net has an analogy with quantum mechanical scattering and pattern formation models

**Control of Cortical Activity:**
- Negative Laplancan nets arise in analysis of hallucinatory effects in cortex
- NRT equations, when coupling with thalamus (TH) and cortex (C), have a nonlinear term that appears crucial for global control of cortical activity by incoming thalamic or NRT input
- This opens the possibility of top-down control in attentional tasks

**Control Problem:**
- It is expected that the anterior pole of NRT exercises authority over more posterior activity every 25 ms based on MEG data reported by Ilinas and Ribary (1992)
- Neuroanatomy indicates possible solution:
  * Limbic cortex has reciprocal connections with anterior thalamic nuclei, but no connections with NRT except from the subicular complex
  * Subicular complex has a one-way projection to the mediodorsal thalamus, known to have connections specifically with the anterior pole of NRT
  * Limbic cortex, part of the Papez limbic circuit, provides control input outside direct NRT control

#### Modeling Consciousness Electrophysiological and Simulation Studies

**Interesting Results from Libet's Experiments (1964)**
- The experiments aimed to determine the threshold current for conscious experience of electrical stimulation on the post central gyrus
- Two quantitative laws summarize the findings:
  - For a short duration (0.5 seconds), enough applied energy is required to "capture" or turn on conscious awareness
  - For longer durations, enough power must be injected to maintain the conscious experience
- The first result fits well with the NRT control structure model, as it functions like a resistive circuit requiring electrical energy for capture
- The second result suggests the need for ongoing power input to keep the consciousness control system active

**Backward Referral in Time (Libet et al. 1979)**
- Conscious experience is backdated to a few tens of milliseconds after the input with peripheral or thalamic excitation, but not with direct cortical stimulation
- This phenomenon contains clues for further model development

**Combining Themes in Consciousness Modeling**
1. Relational Theory of Mind: Semantically coded input and related episodic memories are compared by a decision unit
2. "Conscious I" Model: Global competition is carried out through activity on the NRT

**Understanding How the TH-NRT-C System Leads to Consciousness**
- The TH-NRT-C complex produces the comparator/decision unit of the relational mind theory
- Feedback connections from memory are incorporated to achieve the following:
  - Re-excitation of a host of earlier memories to give consciousness its color or subjective world
  - Amplification and unscrambling of memories through feedback in cortex and the TH-NRT-C complex
- The "Conscious I" model suggests that working memory (WM) is crucial for sustaining input activity long enough to win the competition for consciousness activation

---

#### Competitive Model of Consciousness and Memory Processing

**The Relational Mind and Consciousness Model**

**Components of the Model:**
- **Semantic Module SA**: Receives input IN A, rapidly responds with output going elsewhere or to its dedicated cortical working memory WM A'. This has persistent activity which activates an associated memory store E.
- **Associative Memory Store E**: May be common to multiple working memories like WMA and WMB. Coupled through the TH-NRT-C complex, as well as possibly directly corticocortically.
- **Competition between Working Memories**: A competition occurs between WM A and WMB till one wins and controls the other's activities. The winning memory lays down its content or that of SA' in hippocampus for conscious memorization.
- **Extending the Circuitry:** Includes frontal lobes/basal ganglia for learning sequences of actions; refer to Taylor (1994b).

**Key Principles:**
1. Each input has a specialized semantic coding SA associated with an working memory WM A with persistent activity for up to 2 seconds or longer.
2. Competition occurs between various working memories over critical "neuronal adequacy" time, with one winning and controlling losers' activities.
3. Activities in non-winning SAs can still be used for automatic, nonconscious processing.
4. Upgrading of memory may need to occur offline for unloading hippocampal memories and developing semantic categories.
5. The competitive model can be extended with other candidates besides the TH-NRT-C complex for activating memory representations E in a relational manner as part of the relational mind model.

**Experimental Evidence:**
Recent experimental results on intrusive thoughts (Baddeley, 1993) provide direct psychological evidence for competition between working memories. Activation of visual or auditory working memories reduced occurrence of stimulus-independent thoughts from about 80% to 30%. The disruption was effective on coherent sequential intrusions but had almost no effect on fragmentary independent thoughts or random generation of letters. This fits the competitive relational mind model in a qualitative fashion.

#### Understanding Category Formation and Learning Processes in Infants

**Relational Mind Approach**

**Competitive TH-NRT-C Complex**:
- Includes the hippocampus for declarative memory and frontal lobe/basal ganglia for implicit or skill memory
- Competition for consciousness is run through a WM/Semantic modules, with the competitive structure being outlined

**Building Relations in the Relational Mind Model**:
- Other structures introduced include:
  - Hippocampus for declarative memory
  - Frontal lobe/basal ganglia for implicit or skill memory
- Need to clarify the relations between these structures, including:
  - How they are achieved (prewired or learnt)
  - Learning necessary for flexibility
  - Dependence on preprocessing through semantic modules with coded information that must be learnt

**Challenges in Understanding Relations and Categories**:
- Preliminary answers will be attempted to clarify the relational structure of mind
- Difficulties associated with the nature of categorization, especially language, meaning of words and concepts, and development from infant to adult
- Approaches to relations: mathematical terms, relational semantics, features of objects
- Arbitrary choice of features used to define an object category
- "Similarity" criticized as a method for defining categories
- Script-based development of categories (eating routine script) and the use of both functional and thematic categories
- Even three-month old infants can sort objects in thematic categories and adults use various types of categorization
- Visual pattern categorization without much action, contrary to earlier observation of category inclusion through movement sequence

---

#### Multisensory Perception and Consciousness in the Relational Mind Model

**Relational Model and Consciousness**

**Evidence for Relational Model:**
- Alternating sequence of visual feature memory and eye movement memory used in artificial vision systems (Ryback et al., 1994)
- Suggestion from Noton and Stark (1971) based on experimental evidence

**Functioning of Relational Model:**
- Encoding of inputs guided by action sequences, resulting in functional and thematic encoding in LTM
- Effective in developing semantic memory (Taylor, 1994c)
- Associative action memory f ~ A activated by visual input f leads to new input fl
- Continued activation of features on working memory WM brings about learning of lateral connections on semantic memory SM
- In REM sleep, semantic memory augmented through the TH-NRT-C complex

**Consciousness in Relational Model:**
- Five senses and internal body sensations make up consciousness
- Limit to number of distinct possible winners: four per hemisphere, sixteen overall with lateralization reduction
- Unity of consciousness built into model: only one mode of consciousness and one winner on NRT sheet
- Two hemispheres and their associated thalami have separate non-competing winners.

**Other Aspects of Consciousness:**
- Finite modalities, intentionality, familiarity, subjective feeling considered here; other aspects require more space to discuss.

---

#### Understanding Consciousness through Relational Modeling Semantics and Personal Experience

**The Dual Hemisphere Theory and Consciousness**
- The left and right hemispheres of the brain have distinct functions: language dominance (left) and affect support (right)
- Lateralization is pronounced in human brains, possibly related to heart position
- Dissociation of consciousness centers can occur when corpus callosum is cut, resulting in separate and reduced consciousness

**Intentionality and Consciousness**
- Intentionality arises from being conscious of an object or feeling
- Consciousness is "consciousness of something" (Searle 1991)
- The specific nature of the conscious object is determined by the winning working memory and its associated feedback from episodic and semantic memories

**Familiarity in Consciousness**
- Initial familiarity comes from semantic coding, as memories have no novelty or unexpected elements
- Episodic memory provides additional contextual familiarity as a background to ongoing processing
- Subjective feeling and the "inner view" can be modeled by considering contributions of semantic and episodic feedbacks

**The Point of View in Consciousness**
- The subjective character of experience is determined by the winning working memory's content and related feedback from semantic and episodic memories
- Semantic memory has general culture-specific characteristics with some degree of objectivity, while episodic memories are more person-specific
- Dissociation can occur when corpus callosum is cut, leading to separate consciousness centers.

---

#### Neurophysiological Modeling of Conscious Experience

**The Relational Model and Inner Experience**

**Episodic Memory and Inner Point of View**:
- Episodic memory content is where the inner point of view comes into its own
- The personal "coloring" added to consciousness, the inner "feel" of the experience, is given by the parallel activation and feedback memories associated with the present input
- Particular people, buildings, sights, smells, touches, and sounds from past relevant events are excited (usually subliminally) and guide the competition for consciousness in working memory

**Laying Down Episodic Memories**:
- The process of laying down these episodic memories indicates the filter character of the activity of the competition winner
- The level of relevance and significance of past experiences to ongoing activity depends on mood and emotion
- These stored memories are energized by inputs and basic drives, guiding the ongoing corticothalamic activity in a top-down manner from limbic structures

**Episodic Memory as a Private Diary**:
- The episodic memory is a private diary of the experiences and responses to the experiences of an individual
- It would be difficult for an outsider to discern its meaning, as it is expressed in a coding that will not be easily accessible
- Mood and contextual inputs are essential boundary conditions, as they cannot be captured by just the connection weights of memory

**The Nucleus and Fringe of Consciousness**:
- The nuclear consciousness state (Cnuc) is critically determined by winning semantic memory and associated working memory (Sr(WM)w)
- Cfringe = Cfringel + Cfringe2 + Cfringe3
- Cfringel corresponds to the inattentive information in the fringe, which can be upgraded to the nucleus if needed
- Cfringe2 corresponds to the experience of familiarity, involving tip-of-the-tongue and familiarity of knowledge type events
- Cfringe3 might consist of the feeling of rightness or wrongness of the environment, although this might also arise partly from Cfringe2

**Limitations in Explaining Inner Experience**:
- The competitive relational model does not claim to enable experiencing as X
- Developing and extending imagination can change connection weights of suitable circuits to give the impression of being X
- Complete set of X's experiences cannot be felt without all crucial brain circuitry being achieved through learning

---

#### Exploring Consciousness through a Competitive Relational Model of the Mind

**The Competitive Relational Model of Mind**

**Background:**
- Claims to enable discovery of how it's like to be a conscious being X
- Based on the assumption that X has suitable neural network structure for recognition and memory activities
- Inner view given by relations set up by winning working memory in global competition

**Key Features:**
1. **Limitation**: To achieve transformation without structural change is extremely unlikely
2. **Inner Experience**: Shared by all actors, only one broadcast
3. **Global Blackboard Model**: Extends the idea of a "global blackboard" model (Baars 1988)
4. **Relational Memory Structures**: Emphasize the need for relational memory structures to amplify and constrain incoming signals
5. **Neurophysiological Structures**: Requires resemblance to neurophysiological structures in the brain
6. **Similarities with Other Models:**
   - Dennett's "Pandemonium of specialists" (Dennett 1991)
   - Edelman's emphasis on reafference (Edelman 1989)
7. **Extensions and Implications:**
   - Libet's experimental data can be explained to extend the model
   - Consciousness in beings without requisite neural circuitry is a case-by-case issue

**Comparisons with Other Models:**
- Dennett's "Pandemonium of specialists" (Dennett 1991)
  * Identified with set of competing working memories
  * Added value: relational model emphasizes the role of semantic and episodic memories in amplifying conscious experience
- Edelman (1989)
  * Emphasis on reafference similar to need for feedback from memory structures
  - Working memory structures discussed earlier not augmented, nor in manner of extending model
- Supervisory Attentional System (Norman & Hallice 1986)
  * Has been influential in guiding experiments on working memory
  * Problem of underpinning conscious experience admitted by one of its proponents

**Testing the Competitive Relational Model:**
- Observable thalamic timing systems and specific timings for turn-on of appropriate working memories
- Testable in phenomena like neglect, blindsight, and through noninvasive MEG and rCBF measurements

**Challenges:**
- Consciousness in beings without requisite neural circuitry is a case-by-case issue
- Discussing beings with different orders of consciousness might require waiting for their investigation before speculating further.

### 27 Artificial Attention in an Oscillatory Neural Network

**Neural Network Model for Attention:**

**Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONN)**
- Study of neural networks that represent activity as oscillations
- Segments into coherent groups based on factors: distance and connectivity
  - Directly interacting cells have strong tendency to be coherent
  - Indirectly interacting cells have stronger tendency if more interactions between them
  - Loops of interaction lead to cell coherence
  - Cells with more common interaction parameters tend to be coherent

**Behavior in Complex Input Scenarios:**
1. Rough description of whole: when complexity exceeds capacity, objects merge for maintenance
   - Resembles preattentive process
2. Detailed description of a part: activity corresponding to some objects disappears with increased complexity
   - Represents focusing of attention
3. Hierarchical part-whole description: clustering occurs in multilayered systems when lowest layer cells exceed capacity
  - Can be interpreted as hierarchical part-whole description or shift of attention focus

**Comparison to Human Attention:**
- ONN demonstrates various phenomena resembling human attentional behaviors
- Shows neural network can focus, defocus, and shift attention without additional mechanisms.

---

#### Artificial Attention in an Oscillatory Neural Network A Model of Consciousness

**Coherence Patterns in Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONN)**

**Figure 27.3**: Coherence patterns produced by the ONN of Figure 27.2b:
- Shaded part indicates activity dying out for that part
- Coherence pattern corresponding to Figure 27.2a is similar to upper part of 27.3b, at both parameters

**Figure 27.4**: Multilayered System
- Hierarchical coherence structure (left)
- Flat coherence structure produced by the same ONN, at different parameters (middle)
- Schematic diagram of the ONN (right):
  - Subunits described as boxes: cells with tendency to be incoherent within same box
  - Lines connecting boxes describe coherence-enhancing interactions among cells in connected boxes

**Response Time Increase with Number of Nontargets**:
- Human subjects show linearly increasing response time
- ONN produces similar result through different mechanism
- When number of nontargets increases, they become major "objects" in the ONN
- "Green" becomes more coherent to "X" than "T," reducing target "Green T" firing rate

**Artificial Attention in an Oscillatory Neural Network**:
- A conjunction search with an ONN: finding a "Green T" among "Green Xs" and "Red Ts"
  - Time course corresponding to single-attribute cells, T, X, Green, Red
  - Firing of coherent cell to target (thick lines) vs. remaining parts of Green coherent to nontargets
  - As number of nontargets increase, target firing rate decreases

**Consciousness and the Model**:
- Rigorous experimental approach on feeling is challenging
- Speculative modeling and functional data from pathological studies can help
- ONN provides various attentional behavior without additional mechanisms
- The model's nonlocal character may be different from other feeling models

### 28 The Emergence of Memory Categorization Far From Equilibrium

**Memory Emergence in Artificial Neural Networks**
* Ashby's Discrete Dynamical System
  * Proposed by Ross Ashby (1952) in Design for a Brain
  * Random Boolean network or disordered cellular automaton with sparsely connected cells updating in parallel based on Boolean functions
* Oversimplification of Biological Networks
  * Captures logic implicit in neuron's complexity
  * Boolean functions can be implemented as combinatorial circuits, similar to dendritic trees
* Insights from Simple Networks
  * May provide understanding for complex biological processes
* Memory Concept and Categorization
  * Useful categories for adaptive behavior created out of sensory inputs
  * Clear boundaries are an oversimplification, subnetworks are nested hierarchies
* Importance of Hierarchical Categories
  * Fall naturally into hierarchies of subcategories
  * Highly reliable yet easily changed for learning
  * Fast access is crucial

**Basin of Attraction Field in Random Boolean Networks**
* Partitioning State-Space into Categories (Basins)
* Connected States organised into maps, with branching trees rooted on attractor cycles
* Long transients, approaching chaos dynamics in continuous systems
* Accepted paradigm for content-addressable memory in artificial neural networks

**Learning and Adaptability**
* Learning algorithms change basin of attraction field
* Reassigning states as predecessors through connection or function adjustments
* Adding or removing states implies learning/forgetting
* Sculpting the basin to desired configuration is possible

**Basin of Attraction Field Structure in Biological Neural Networks**
* Formed by evolution, development, and context of subnetworks within larger systems
* Emergence of higher-level cognitive properties based on lower-level memory categories.

---

#### Basin of Attraction Fields in Random Boolean Networks

**Random Boolean Networks**

**Architecture**:
- Cells have values of 0 or 1, but could extend to more values
- Global state: pattern of Os and Is at a given moment
- Each cell synchronously updates its value in discrete time steps
- Value depends on Boolean function applied to pseudoneighborhood (size K)
- Values in neighborhood set by single wire couplings to cells
- System iterated, parameters remain fixed to maintain basin of attraction field

**Parameters**:
- 2K permutations of values in a neighborhood of size K
- Boolean function (equivalent to cellular automata rule) written as rule table
- Total number of distinct rule tables = 2^(2K)  N
- Alternative wiring/rule schemes for a given network vast, even for small networks

**Similarities with Neural Networks**:
- Random Boolean network architecture similar to weightless neural networks
- Classical neural network uses weighted connections and threshold function
- Total number of distinct possible Boolean functions much larger than classical neural networks

**Dynamical Systems**:
- Pattern of network activation at a given time is the network's state
- State-space: space of all 2N possible patterns
- Each state has one successor, but any number of predecessors (transients)
- Attractor: repeat pattern in system when it enters and gets locked into
- Transient: portion of trajectory outside attractor cycle
- Basin of attraction: set of all transient trees plus their attractor

**Computing Basins of Attraction**:
- Exhaustively testing entire state space intractable for large networks
- Algorithms devised to generate preimages, faster than exhaustive testing

**Random Boolean Networks vs. Neural Networks**:
- Random Boolean network may be seen as a discrete generalization of sparsely connected classical neural networks
- Threshold function is a tiny subset of the 22K possible Boolean functions in a random Boolean network

---

#### Random Boolean Networks and Categorization in Brain Function

**Random Boolean Network as a Model of Neural Activity**

**Memory and Equilibrium**:
- Random Boolean network can serve as model for semi-autonomous patch of neurons in brain
- Wiring scheme models connected neurons, applies nonlinear computation to determine firing at next time step
- Biological computation depends on precise topology of dendritic tree, microcircuitry, and membrane properties
- Networks within cells based on cytoskeleton and protein polymers may be involved in "internal nervous system" suggested by Hameroff
- Basin of attraction field implicit in wiring rule scheme or wetware for subnetworks linked as components in super-network

**Recognition and Categorization**:
- Seeding new state in subnetwork nt opens sequence of categories to which it belongs
- Recognition involves activation of another subnetwork by axons of neurons in nt, then further recognition by third subnetwork n3, and so on
- Transient tree topology in basin of attraction field allows for richer memory substrate than just attractors alone

**Learning Algorithms**:
- Learning new behavior implies adjusting wiring/rule scheme to amend basin of attraction field
- Learned behavior often requires no mental effort, while learning a new skill requires conscious effort and changes in neural architecture
- Consciousness coincides with desire to learn or be creative, and process of making those changes is unknown

**Emergence of Categorization**:
- Principle of categorization still applies even when basin fragments are computed
- Detailed learning algorithms for random Boolean network have been proposed (Wuensche 1993)

---

#### Emergence of Memory and Cognition A Basin of Attraction Approach

**Key Concepts:**
- **Basin of Attraction Field**: A region in state space where a system tends to evolve towards a specific attractor (stable equilibrium point).
- **Learning Methods:**
  - Adjusting rule scheme: Changing specific bits in Boolean functions at mismatched cells to correct mismatches. Success is certain and has no limit on number of preimages learnt. No side effects on previously learnt preimages.
  - Rewiring: Changing the network's wiring to correct mismatches. Success is not guaranteed, but there are many alternative options. Previously learnt preimages may be forgotten, besides other side effects. Can lead to positive side effects as similar preimages are likely learnt by default.
- **Basin Structure Stability:** The stability of basin structure after learning is noteworthy.
- **Memory**: Emerges when subnetworks combine and maintain each other far from equilibrium, providing a richer substrate for memory than attractors alone.
- **Complex Adaptive Systems**: Life emerges through self-organization of matter, with complex adaptive systems having the potential to create cognition and consciousness.
- **Components of Cognition Emergence:** Suggested components are hierarchical categories implicit in the dynamics of neural subnetworks, where memory provides the substrate for unconstrained emergence of higher level cognitive states.

**Basin of Attraction Diagrams**: Capture a simple network's capacity for distributed memory by demonstrating a complex hierarchy of categorization within basin trees, which are far from equilibrium. The relationship between basin field and network may provide a metaphor for the mind/brain.

## VI Subneural Biology

**Subneural Biology: Understanding Consciousness Through Cellular Functioning**
* Connectionist views of brain focus on neuronal synapses as information units, but living cells are more complex than single-cell organisms
* Single-cell organisms lead active lives without synapses; neurons are even more complicated due to dynamic regulation of synaptic sensitivity controlled by cell cytoskeleton
* Understanding consciousness requires comprehension of how cells function as unitary entities (cellular binding problem)
* Protein-ordered water clusters in the five nanometer range produce extended, cooperative three-dimensional patterns, which can resonate and transform into macroscopic quantum states (Watterson)
* Microtubules: major structures of neuronal cytoskeleton; proposed as each cell's "on board computer" organizing real-time dynamical activities (Tuszynski et al.)
+ Ferroelectric phase can support signaling
+ Spin-glass phase can support computation
* Neuronal membrane is the essential site for quantum computing, which is necessary to conscious functioning (Wallace)
* Anesthetics erase consciousness by binding weakly to specific brain proteins in membranes and cytoplasm at quantum level; psychedelic drugs have opposite effects due to preventing quantum events in protein hydrophobic pockets essential for consciousness (Louria and Hameroff)
* Cells are more than bit states, with capabilities for processing and representing information extending several hierarchical levels downward, possibly to the quantum level.

### 29 Water Clusters Pixels of Life

**Introduction:**
- Consciousness is based on synchronized cell activity
- Cells function as entities, not collections of biochemistry
- Water plays a crucial role in maintaining order and stability for cells to act together

**Living Cell Composition:**
- Complex system made up of roughly one part protein to four parts water
- Nanometer range contains subcellular complexes with essential living matter order
- Mesoscopic level (5 nm) houses intermediate world of coherent protein mechanisms like enzyme action

**Water's Role in Living Matter:**
- Origin of "oneness" quality in cells traced to order in liquid water at mesoscopic level
- Dynamic clusters of defined size exist in water, resembling proteins in size and function
- These clusters explain how protein-water interaction creates extended cooperative three-dimensional system for living matter

**Pressure Pixel Concept:**
- Maxwell's Kinetic Theory of Gases: unit volume containing one gas molecule called "pressure pixel" (v0)
- Proposed that the same concept applies to liquid phase, with a pressure pixel size of about 40 cubic nm (11 molecules long) in room temperature and biosphere conditions
- Existence of multimolecular structures of this size in liquids understood through cluster model
- Pressure has no meaning in volumes smaller than v0.

**Conclusion:**
- Water plays an essential role in the origin, maintenance, and stability of life due to its unique properties and ability to exist in a flexible yet rich molecular structure.

---

#### Water Cluster Model and Protein Structure

**Liquid Structure and Water Clusters**
* Liquid tension mediated by intermolecular interactions, strongest in water due to H-bonds
* H-bonds: result of OH atoms bonding with neighboring O atoms
* Responsible for physical properties like high melting and boiling points, specific heat, surface tension
* Cooperative effect: strengthens existing bonds as new ones form
* Structuring promotes further structuring, forms clusters held together by H-bonds
* Thermal collisions limit extent of structural buildup
* Idealized picture: subdivided into grid of equally sized cubic clusters (wave-cluster model)
* Pressure PI < PO in solutions due to fewer molecules in gas phase
* Clusters smaller, VI < V0 in solutions, lower k value
* Energy change thermal in nature according to classical theory
* Osmosis and gelation important in biology, but not explained by statistical mechanics

**Protein Structure**
* Long polymer molecules composed of amino acids (average length: about 200)
* Chains are not extended randomly but folded into compact shape excluding water
* Cubes with edge dimensions in the 3-4 nm range
* Variety of internal structures due to choice of 20 different amino acids as links
* Purified protein: all chains fold identically into unique three-dimensional structure stable in water under biosphere conditions.

---

#### Water Clusters and Protein Structure A Cooperative Interplay

**Protein Clusters and Cytoplasmic Gel:**
* Proteins are held together by an internal network of H-bonds, similar to water clusters
* Pressure pixels control protein solute form
* Proteins behave like particles due to water structure interactions
* Cytoplasmic gel is a complex of protein and water, not random solution
* Water plays active role in this structured complex
* Classical theories based on chaotic water molecule motion fail to explain gelation mechanism
* In protein gel, solute protein molecules are compact, occupying pixel volume with unique shapes
* Solid-like material formed by inducing alignment of spatially compatible water clusters
* Cooperativity between clusters produces extended structures like gels.

**Figure 29.2: The Gel State:**
- Up to 80% water in biosphere's most important state
- Produced by cooperativity between protein solute clusters and surrounding water clusters
- Protein molecules are compact cubes with basic pixel size, containing strands folded into a unique shape
- Flexible structure allows binding/release steps to switch vibrational modes.

**Water Clusters:**
- Cannot be understood by classical theories based on reductionist assumptions
- Solid-like materials formed through cooperativity between clusters
- Swelling of clays is an example of this phenomenon, where water flows into stacked sheets despite high pressures.

**Figure 29.3: Pressure Pixel Concept:**
- Two-dimensional surfaces cause ordering of water clusters into packed layers
- Flat surface induces nodal plane in structure wave
- Classical theories fail to explain gelation mechanism due to misconception about single water molecule pressure agents.

---

#### Coherent Water Clusters and Quantum Mechanisms in Living Systems

**The Osmotic Mechanism and Macroscopic Implications**

**Cooperativity between Water Clusters:**
- Alignment of clusters on extended two-dimensional surface induces in-phase behavior
- Pressure pixel becomes as large as the surface, allowing tension to extend over macroscopic distances

**Osmotic Process:**
- Tension within unified layer drives process by pulling water into stack parallel to surfaces
- Fusion of clusters can result in a cluster spanning entire particle surface, producing pressure pixel of macroscopic proportions
- Once pressure pixel forms, tension spreads laterally throughout region, eliminating pressure and replacing it with tension

**Limitations:**
- Clay lacks complexity and information processing ability due to static pixels
- System lacks internal flexibility needed for computation

**Understanding Mesoscopic Entities:**
- Water clusters and proteins are structural elements emerging from thermal motion through cooperative order-disorder interactions
- These entities appear as a wave, resonating and fusing to create higher-level quanta

**Macroscopic Implications:**
- When many small pixels become one macroscopic quantum, disruptive pressure becomes unifying tension
- This transition can spread through entire cytoplasm, making cell act as one entity
- This macroscopic quantum gives protein gel its alive quality and allows it to extend beyond cell membrane
- Correlations among aligned cells could induce harmonic transitions involving macroscopic quanta, leading to synchronous behavior in populations of cells.

### 30 Microtubular Self-Organization and Information Processing Capabilities

**Microtubules and Consciousness: Investigating Their Role in Subcellular Consciousness**

**Microtubules**:
- Comprised of hollow cylinders formed by protofilaments aligned along their axes
- Spans macroscopic dimensions, assemblies of 13 longitudinal protofilaments
- Consists of tubulin dimers (polar, 8-nm-long dimers) with two slightly different monomers
- Possess permanent electric dipole moments that can change orientation
- Provide an example of electret substance, assembly of oriented dipoles

**Investigating Dipole Arrangements**:
- Conformational states of tubulin dimers within MTs may be coupled to charge distribution or dipolar states
- Leads to piezoelectric properties and important in assembly/disassembly behavior

**MT Behavior and Information Processing**:
- Two ends grow at different rates, with active positive end growing faster than inactive negative end
- Ensembles of MTs are synchronized, leading to periodic oscillations in their dynamics
- Conjectured that MTs could act as processing channels and parallel-arrayed memory channels

**Biangular Array of Coupled Local Dipole Moments**:
- Entire MT viewed as a regular (biangular) array of coupled local dipole moments interacting with neighbors via dipole-dipole forces
- Simplified view adopted, with elastic degrees of freedom not explicitly included
- Appropriate generalization of the physical model poses no technical difficulties

---

#### Stability and Switching of Microtubular Phases

**Dipolar Lattice Model**
- Describes interactions between dipoles in a medium: Eo (vacuum permitivity), e (dielectric constant), rij (distance between sites i and j)
- Relevant situation for calculations: Figure 30.3, Figure 30.3a shows "+" and "-" signs representing parallel or antiparallel dipole moments respectively
- Numerical results for constants I1, 12, 13, and angles 6 (between dipole axis and direction joining neighboring dipoles) based on known structural data

**Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Ising Model**
- Maps situation onto anisotropic two-dimensional Ising model
- Approximate effective Hamiltonian: H = -IijZiZj, where Iij depends on choice of dipole pairs
- System exhibits frustration due to odd number (13) of protofilaments and inability to satisfy all bond requirements for a closed path along direction corresponding to 12
- Ensuing phase structure: spin-glass phase (SG)

**Spin-Glass Phase**
- Spin orientations are locally "frozen" in random directions due to multitude of equivalent orientations
- Large degeneracy of ground state on the order of ~10^23
- Absence of long-range order but presence of short-range correlations
- System is soft energetically, allowing for a number of stable spin arrangements

**Properties of Spin-Glass Phase**
- Ideal for computational applications due to easy formation and switching between local ordered states
- Can be eliminated by: application of electric field, raising temperature above transition temperature, or changing boundary conditions

**Kink-Like Excitation (KLE) in Ferroelectric Phase**
- Propagates along a MT with velocity proportional to electric field E (2-100 m/s)
- Assumption: KLE formation mainly due to hydrolysis of GTP into GDP; one act of hydrolysis corresponds to conformational change and formation of single KLE
- Preferential orientation towards intrinsic electric field in cell, distributing energy at preferred end of a MT for detaching dimers from far end.

#### Microtubules as Information Processors Optimal Conditions for Functioning

**Microtubular Self-Organization: Conditions for Phase Transition**

**Introduction:**
- Discussing conditions for microtubules (MTs) functioning in the SG phase and potential onset of consciousness activities.
- The infinite triangular lattice has only two phases: paraelectric (above Tc) and F phase (below Tc), with no SG phase present in this limit.
- Critical temperature Tc depends linearly on model parameters Q, d2, and E. Realistic values yield temperatures between 200 K and 400 K.

**Factors Affecting Transition Temperature:**
1. Dielectric constant E: Altered by water molecules, decreasing value lowers Tc and introduces dipolar disorder.
2. Structural changes: Small shifts in dimer dipole angles prevent SG phase onset or enhance frustration favoring it.
3. Monte Carlo simulations for finite lattices: SG phase gradually removed as N increases; dynamic processes can remove information processing capabilities by expelling the SG phase or raising temperature above a characteristic length-dependent value.
4. External electric fields and MAPs: Shift transition region and make it broader, with magnitudes depending on MAP pattern and ratio to total lattice sites.

**Information Capacity Calculations:**
1. Mean-field approximation for ferroelectric and paraelectric phases using Landau energy functional (Equation 6).
2. Information capacity calculations using Shannon definition of information (Equation 9) within each domain i.
3. Highest information capacity at boundary between SG and paraelectric phases; MTs should function as information processors in this narrow window.
4. Spatial arrangement of dipole moments crucial for MT functioning as a dynamic self-organizing system.

**Conclusion:**
- Two dielectric phases: low-temperature F phase and high-temperature ferri-electric phase with net polarization above room temperature.
- Potential control mechanisms for operating mode selection between information processing and assembly/disassembly types, shedding light on enhanced MT formation rates during important stages of organism development.

#### Quantum Computation in Neural Membranes A Theory of Consciousness

**Neural Membrane Computations: Quantum Learning in Biological Systems**

**Complexity Theory and Neural Membranes**
- Afferent impulses at outer membrane surface encode complex problem statements
- Unpacked into charge density automata or Rydberg computational tokens
- High-energy arrangement of annealed charge-density automata represents solution
- Subsequent channel opening and regulated ion movement converts microscopic solution to frequency code

**Learning in Neural Membranes**
- Evolutionarily essential for adapting to environmental changes
- Information regarding change communicated back to system, generating structural or behavioral modification
- Quantum learning possible with sufficient time and cytological change

**Quantum Computation in Neural Membranes**
- Mesoscopic coupling between membrane and cytoskeleton enables long-term change
- Membrane-regulated permeant movement generates spike frequency pattern, activating ligand-gated Ca2+ channel (NMDA receptor)
- Conjunction of depolarization signal and glutamate binding activates NMDA protein, allowing regulated Ca2+ movement into cytoplasm
- Calpain-mediated phosphorylation modifies attachment topology of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) on microtubules

**Quantum Computation in Early Evolution: Paramecium and Tetrahymena**
- Coordinated beating of cilia resembles electrochemistry of membrane-cytoskeleton interactions in nerve cells
- Suggests neural communication began as an exaptation of unicellular movement mechanisms

**Microtubule Conformational Changes and Learning Paradigms**
- Tubulin conformational changes propagate as waves through the cytoskeletal network
- Affect phase relations of subsequent afferent pulses, which may impact membrane algorithms

**Neural Membrane Computations: Role in Consciousness and Evolutionary Theory**
- Most sophisticated applications exist in higher modules for processing complex problems related to mobility in complex environments
- Continual integration of sensory and autonomic data into consciousness representations
- Neural membrane proposed as the "master computer" of consciousness, extending Darwinian theory into quantum mechanics.

### 32 Computer Simulation of Anethetic Binding in Protein Hydrophobic Pockets

**Computer Simulation of Anesthetic Binding in Protein Hydrophobic Regions**

**Anesthesia and Consciousness**:
- At a precise level, general anesthetics erase consciousness while preserving other brain functions (e.g., EEG, evoked potentials, autonomic drives)
- Understanding anesthesia may shed light on consciousness

**Anesthetics and Lipid Membranes**:
- Early attempts to understand anesthesia attributed it to anesthetics acting in lipid portions of membranes
- Two factors led to reassessment:
  - Anesthetic "cut-off effect": Nonvolatile anesthetics of homologous structures lose activity at a critical volume equivalent to two hexanol molecules (0.4 nm)
  - Realization that dynamic conformational functions in proteins (e.g., ion channels, receptors, enzymes, second messenger transduction, cytoskeletal function) are essential for neural activity

**Anesthetic Binding Sites**:
- Membrane-free enzymes like luciferase were found to be directly inhibited by anesthetics in proportion to their potency
- These effects reconciled with the Meyer-Overton correlation by the presence of **hydrophobic pockets** within proteins, which have the same solubility characteristics as lipids
- Binding occurs through **van der Waals forces**, which are weak and account for the reversibility of anesthesia

**Computer Simulation Study**:
- Simulated hydrophobic regions in two enzymes:
  - **Papain**: Known to be inhibited by anesthetics
  - **Acetylcholinesterase**: Unaffected by anesthetics
- Derived and compared effects of the anesthetic halothane on hydrophobic pocket energy measures between the two proteins

---

#### Anesthetic Binding and Quantum Coherence in Protein Hydrophobic Pockets

**Anesthetic Binding Simulation: Papain-Halothane Interactions**

**Background:**
- Discovering favorable binding conditions for halothane and papain's hydrophobic active center
- Comparison of intermolecular energy calculations between anesthetic and acetylcholinesterase

**Results:**
- Decrease in papain's active hydrophobic site energy with anesthetic: protein stabilization
  - Majority contributed by van der Waals forces, electron cloud dipole couplings
  - No significant changes for acetylcholinesterase
- Lack of conformational change due to negligible interatomic distance alterations

**Explanation:**
- Protein function depends on dynamic conformational activity
  * Importance of hydrophobic pockets in regulating protein conformation through quantum level events (Frohlich theory)
    **Electron mobility and protein conformational states**
- Anesthetics prevent mobility of electrons within hydrophobic pockets, potentially inhibiting protein function

**Computer Simulation Results:**
- Five possible anesthetic binding sites in membrane proteins (Figure 32.2)
  * Hydrophobic pocket in membrane protein: papain
- Anesthetic sensitivity and insensitivity observed between papain and acetylcholinesterase

**Discussion:**
- Anesthetics act by preventing electron mobility within hydrophobic pockets
- Psychedelic drugs (tryptamine, phenylethylamine) bind to similar hydrophobic pockets but exert opposite effects
  * Selective binding due to polar tails of their structures
- Anesthetics have nonspecific hydrophobic binding in lipids and nonneural proteins compared to hallucinogens.

## VII Quantum Theory

**Quantum Theory and Consciousness**

**Understanding Consciousness:**
- Quantum theory describes details of universe where consciousness exists
- Reveals features that may help explain enigmatic features of consciousness

**Quantum Phenomena:**
- Atoms and subatomic particles aren't definite until observed (wave function collapse or reduction)
- Exist in "coherent superposition" of different states simultaneously
  - Spin, location, momentum
- Uncertainty yields stable structures in macroworld

**Wave Function Collapse:**
- No obvious explanation for cause and occurrence
- Heisenberg, von Neumann et al.: Conscious observation collapses wave function
- Even macroscopic objects can remain superposed until observed

**Illustration of Superposition:**
- Schrdinger's cat in a box: dead and alive until opened
- Critical mass-energy difference between superposed states leads to reduction

**Penrose's Perspective:**
- Each superposed state "chooses" singular classical state (noncomputational)
- Essential for consciousness, unattainable in computers
- Space-time geometries and quantum process in fundamental space-time geometry are intimately associated with consciousness

**Nonlocal Coherence:**
- Quantum objects remain connected after interaction
- Solution to the "binding problem" of consciousness

**Implications for Consciousness:**
- Quantum theory provides ground for Eastern philosophy, monistic idealism
  - Mind of God as a spinning coin whose chosen face is revealed through observation
- Nonlocal quantum coherence may provide mechanisms for binding and unitary sense of self

**Proposals for Quantum Coherence in Brain:**
- John Eccles: Quantum uncertainty influences neurotransmitter release at synapses
- Brain proteins, membranes, cell water, microtubules proposed sites for coherent superposition and wave function collapse/reduction

**Other Perspectives on Consciousness:**
- Danah Zohar: Nonlocal quantum coherence among neural proteins provides mechanisms for binding and self
- Fred Alan Wolf: Self-awareness arises from superposition of quantum automata in neurons and glial cells during dreaming
- Michael Conrad: Quantum wave function collapse at the level of neural proteins can be amplified to control brain activities, carrying potential for qualia and free will.

#### Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness Emergence Binding and Collapse

**Quantum Superposition and Proteins: Conrad's Perspective**
- Electrons and hydrogen bonds in proteins controlled by quantum superposition dynamics
- Influence on protein conformation and function

**Water Ordering and Consciousness: Jibu, Hagan, and Yasue**
- Quantum optical coherence essential for consciousness emerges from water ordering in hollow cores of microtubules
- Coherent photons generated by biochemical pumping of microtubules provide unitary binding crucial to consciousness
- General anesthesia results from effects on microtubule and other proteins, disrupting water-ordering and quantum coherence

**Quantum Coherence in Microtubules: Hameroff and Penrose**
- Model of quantum coherence and wave function self-collapse (orchestrated reduction) in constituent proteins of microtubules
- Preconscious processing related to quantum computing while in coherent superposition
- Consciousness tied to self-collapse and orchestrated reduction
- Microtubules capable of supporting and isolating quantum coherence
- Self-collapse occurs due to critical perturbation of space-time geometry

**Quantum Theory in Consciousness:**
- Two general applications of quantum properties to explain binding and emergence of self-identity: Danah Zohar and Fred Alan Wolf
- Michael Conrad's in-depth treatise on wave function collapse related to proteins, potential intrinsic quantum properties of qualia
- Focus on microtubules as possible quantum devices: Jibu, Hagan, Yasue; Hameroff and Penrose
- Critics argue invoking quantum theory in consciousness is a reductio ad absurdum; however, consciousness remains unexplained.

### 33 Consciousness and Bose-Einstein Condensates

**Bose-Einstein Condensation and Consciousness**

**Overview:**
- Discussion about physics of consciousness, Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), and their potential role in consciousness theory
- Distinction between basic conscious awareness capacity and structure/contents of that awareness

**Basic Consciousness Capacity vs. Structure:**
- Shared with all sentient creatures including simple animals
- Philosophical approaches: dualism, monism, and double-aspect theory

**Understanding Physical Realm:**
- Overwhelmingly described by Newtonian physics in the past century
- Characteristics: deterministic, reductionist, atomistic, either/or logic

**Newtonian vs. Quantum Physics:**
- Motivation for quantum theories of consciousness due to difficulties explaining certain phenomenological features of consciousness
- Newtonian physics no longer at cutting edge of physical thinking

**Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC):**
- Salient characteristics: indeterminate, non-classical, and emergent properties
- Potential role in understanding the physics of consciousness.

---

#### Uncertainty and Holism in Quantum Consciousness

**Quantum Physics and Consciousness**
- Uncertainty in quantum process: collapse is uncertain, emergent, and holistic
- Similarities between quantum world and consciousness: uncertainty principle, holism, free will, imagination, human creativity, unity of consciousness

**Uncertainty Principle and Consciousness:**
- Heisenberg's principle: position vs momentum (uncertainty)
- Human consciousness: vague thought or focused one (choose between)
- Similarities noted by David Bohm in 1951

**Holism in Quantum Processes:**
- Whole is more than the sum of its parts
- Entangled particles correlated with each other
- Nonlocal relations: apparently separate events correlated without causal forces
- Wave aspects of quantum entities are entangled

**Free Will and Consciousness:**
- Impossible to model in Newtonian terms (fully determined)
- Compatible with quantum principles
- Human creativity, imagination, and unitary consciousness require both/and physical substrate

**Unity of Consciousness:**
- Descartes' observation: mind is essentially unified vs body is not
- Question: how do our brains combine sensory data into a unitary picture? (The "binding problem")
- Quantum substrate for consciousness might provide unity.

**Holism in Quantum Processes:**
- Holism: quantum nonlocality, entangled particles, nonlocal relations, wave aspects
- Similarities with consciousness: holism or contextualism.

---

#### Quantum Unity and Consciousness Bose-Einstein Condensates

**Quantum Unity in Consciousness and Physics**

**Instantaneous Correlations**:
- Correlated characteristics between polarized entities, even with no force or signal traveling between them

**Quantum Entanglement**:
- Contrasted with classical (Newtonian) atomism
- Quantum entities overlap and become entangled, sharing an identity
- Wave aspects of two similar quantum systems extend across space and time, leading to a shared identity

**Relevance to Consciousness Unity**:
- Discussed in the context of how consciousness perceives and unifies diverse sensory data
- Classical physics cannot explain how a brain with millions of neurities can bind this information together into a unitary whole
- Quantum substrate in the brain could allow for entangled elements to share an identity, providing a possible explanation

**Ordered Consciousness**:
- Not just unified, but also ordered - perceiving and thinking with contents and structure
- Classical physics cannot provide both order and unity, so a quantum substrate is proposed

**Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC)**:
- Display both unity and high degree of order
- Behavior like one large molecule, rather than individual separate parts
- Found in nature (e.g., neutron stars) and technology (superfluids, superconductors, lasers)
- Proposed as a physical substrate for the unity of consciousness due to their properties

**Limitations**:
- Extensive work has been done, but objections remain regarding the practical implementation in the brain.

---

#### Quantum Coherence and Consciousness in Neurons

**Frohlich-style Coherent Quantum Activity in the Brain**

**Background:**
- Frohlich's work at Liverpool University (1986) focused on coherent quantum activity in biological tissue, including bacteria, yeast cells, red blood cells, DNA, cell microtubules, and water
- Hypothesis: Any biological tissue should incorporate Bose - Einstein condensation of this sort at body temperature
- Frohlich was interested in biological coordination; Marshall applied the work to consciousness

**Frohlich's Findings:**
1. Energy pumping through cells leads to dipole molecule synchronization and microwave signal broadcasting
2. Coherent phase relationship forming between microwaves results in Bose - Einstein condensation
3. Extent of coherence and strength of consciousness depend on available energy levels
4. Various suggestions for where such activity might occur: protein or fat molecules in cell membranes, microtubules, or water within cells
5. Coherent quantum phenomena could unify spatially separated regions of the brain by extending over considerable distances through microtubules

**Implications:**
1. Subneuron level quantum phenomena are crucial to understanding consciousness; neural oscillations alone do not explain binding problem
2. Underlying quantum field acts as integrator for higher-level neural oscillations, resulting in perceptual unity
3. Recent experiment at Southampton University suggests a link between subneuron level quantum phenomena and conscious thoughts/perceptions
4. Quantum dimension may be involved in rapid integration of perceptual data by the brain
5. Overall model of mind would need to incorporate knowledge from multiple levels: whole networks of neurons, neuron level, and subneuron molecular/quantum level.

### 34 On the Quantum Mechanics of Dreams and the Emergence of Self-Awareness

**Quantum Mechanics of Dreams and Self-Awareness**
* Exploration of a quantum model for self-awareness in dreams
* Self-awareness arises from memory device (automaton) obtaining holographically stored glial cell memories and its own images
* Model based on Nobill's work on ionic wave movement in glial cells and Albert's research on quantum automata

**Background**
* Research into relationship between physics and consciousness
* Self as hierarchy of levels of awareness, based on Nobill and Albert's work

**Glial Cells**
* Brain generates electrical wave activity (EEGs)
* Glial cells perform metabolic function, more than just nourishment
* Suspected role in memory process and visualization
* Holographic storage of memories with the help of glial cells

**Quantum Automata and Self-Awareness**
* Automata exist in brain as glial cells or structures between neural walls
* Capable of observing self-reflective states without disrupting themselves
* Cannot observe objective states in other automata without causing disruptions.

**Model Description**
* Based on Nobill's holographic memory theory and Albert's quantum automata research
* Automata obtain images from holographically stored glial cell memories and their own self-images
* Self-reflective images ordered by hierarchy based on levels of self-inquiry
* Higher levels achieved by integrating lower level images into record.

---

#### Quantum Mechanics of Self-Reflection Superposition and Memory

**Self-Reflection and Quantum Mechanics**

**Uncertainty Principle**:
- Automaton cannot obtain single image and superposition of images simultaneously

**Levels of Self-Reflective Thinking**:
1. First self-reflective level: Images and records are superimposed, resulting in "emotional" memory
2. Second level: Thought forms integrated into archetypes
3. Fourth level: Archetypes integrated into super-archetypes

**Holographic Memory**:
- Object interacted with by automaton is holographic image pattern in glial cells
- Complementary observations of images built up self-reflectively

**Superposition and Observables**:
- Automaton can "know" complementary observables of itself, but not another automaton
- Superposition of two images creates emotional image (e.g., unhappy woman)
- Thought-form images represent emotional states (e.g., feminine or motherly understanding)
- Archetypal images represent overarching concepts (e.g., "goddess")

**Quantum Physics and Memory**:
- Complementary observable operators operate on glial cell states
- Glial cell contains image record, automaton obtains single image at random
- Superposition of automaton and glial cell in parallel worlds interpretation is also an observable memory state

---

#### Quantum Interrogation and Self-Reflection of the Automaton

**The Automaton's Memory and Self-Reflection**

**Two Versions of the Story**:
- World II: The automaton would yield a crying sister image, matching the glial cell's record
- World I: The automaton would yield an image of a hysterical mother, matching the glial cell's record

**Interrogation Methods**:
- Interrogation by a second automaton
- Self-interrogation

**Two Complementary Questions**:
- (a) What image exists separately in the glial cell and in your memory?
- (b) What image exists compositely?

**Interrogation by a Second Automaton**:
- If the second automaton interacts with both the first automaton and the glial cell, it can determine:
  - The woman image present in both
  - The emotional state of the first automaton and the glial cell together (El(0))

**Interrogation by the First Automaton**:
- When the first automaton interrogates itself, it can record the **superposition of both images and emotions** (E(O)), which is a new level of self-reflection. This state is denoted as el(1)
- After this jump in levels, the automaton can experience and record its own existence in multiple worlds

**The Self/Not Self Boundary**:
- The appearance of the el(1) state marks the boundary between **self and nonself**. It represents the first act of self-reflection.

---

#### Quantum Self-Reflection Automatas Consciousness and Emotional States

**Automaton Self-Reflection and Uncertainty Principle**

**Automaton's Memory**:
- Automaton looks at its own memory, feeling unhappiness
- Automaton "knows that it knows" and "knows" at the same time
- Recognizes itself through reflection in another world

**Self-Interrogation**:
- Automaton can interrogate itself about emotional state (el(0)) and woman image state (Wi)
- If asking about emotional state, automaton obtains knowledge of itself as well as glial cell
- Asking about woman image state allows automaton to obtain single images in each world without "breaking in" memory

**Uncertainty Principle**:
- Automaton knows both emotional state and woman image states in each world, but this does not violate uncertainty principle because information is not objective

**Information Obtaining and Altering**:
- Attempts by other automatons to obtain records can alter the first automaton's records
- Mere asking of questions can change memory, even if automaton asks itself

**Levels of Self-Reflection**:
- Automaton has conscious self-reflective states and unconscious thoughtform states at each level
- Unconscious thought-forms arise from emotional material in conscious emotions or feelings
- Self-reflection results in unconscious thought-form becoming conscious and ascending to higher levels, creating new archetypal states.

---

#### Quantum Self-Reflection Model in Dreams

**The Formation of the Hierarchy of Self-Identification**

**Wolf's Perspective:**
- Combines four primal image states (Wi) into two emotional states (Ei and Ej)
- Emotional states are combined to form a single thought-form state (Fi')
- Mind and identity as an object or person is constructed at each level of the hierarchy
- Opportunity for self-reflection presented at each level
- Self-reflection results in experience of state above it

**Unconscious Emotional States:**
- Felt unconsciously during lowest "0" level self-interrogation
- Become conscious during level "(1)" inquiry as emotional feelings
- Superposed to level "(1)" thought-forms, remaining unconscious as thoughts until a self-inquiry at level "(1)"

**Conscious Thought States:**
- Unconscious thought-forms integrate or superimpose conscious emotions
- Thoughts can have no emotional content per se but may arise when expressed in words (self-reflection)
- Descent down the hierarchy results in less self-awareness and greater entropy
- Ascent up the hierarchy allows for greater choices, awareness of other "worlds," and more complex imagery

**Lucid Awareness:**
- At highest level, possibly reachable through training or meditation techniques
- State of "pure" awareness with no images present (God awakening from the dream)

---

### 35 Percolation and Collapse of Quantum Parallelism A Model of Qualia and Choice

**The Problem of Assimilating Consciousness into Science**
- **Consciousness**: Precondition for all experience and scientific knowledge
- Scientific community has struggled to incorporate consciousness into a unified system of science
- Many great scientists and philosophers have grappled with the problem
- No definitive solution or consensus has been reached, achievements are best viewed in terms of their contribution to understanding the difficulty of the problem

**Possible Positions on the Issue**
1. Scientific community has not pursued the issue vigorously enough: Contradicted by historical facts
2. Touching on conceptual antinomies: Freedom versus necessity, part vs whole, inside vs outside
3. Achievements of main theories (determinism and reversibility) dissolve freedom into illusion
4. Alternative theory: Allows for consciousness features but also transformation into illusion
5. Proper scientific theory should be relativity of philosophical position

**Fluctuon Model: Physical Underpinning**
- True time evolution dynamics are irreversible and probabilistic
- Wave function collapse is inherent in the time development of the universe
- Consequences are not detectable in most cases, except in biological systems due to sensitive transduction-amplification cascades
- Model builds a role for gravity in life and mind as it's connected to collapse process

**Technical Details**
- Based on a Dirac-like sea of unmanifest vacuum fermions
- Virtual particles identified as self-perpetuating chains of transient fermion-antifermion pairs (fluctuons)
- Pairs must decay within time interval specified by uncertainty principle, otherwise energy violation occurs
- Decay is accompanied by creation of new pair until it reaches an absorber particle to transfer excess momentum.

---

#### Quantum-Gravity Link to Consciousness Collapse and Homeostasis in Molecular Systems

**Fluctuon Model: Vacuum Seas and Particles**

**Supersea of vacuum fermions:**
- Mediates gravitational field through gravitons
- Changes in states of manifest particles alter density structure
- Nonlinearity introduced into time evolution equations
- Isomorphic to space curvature in general relativity
- Gravity is an indirect interaction, mediated by emanating gravitons

**Subsea of vacuum electrons:**
- Mediates electromagnetic and weak interactions
- Photons interpreted as chains of transiently excited electron-positron pairs
- Negligible contribution to total vacuum density
- Incorporates Mach's principle (universal mass influences gravity)

**Requirements for a quantum mechanical theory:**
- Principle of equivalence: indistinguishable from acceleration
- Nonlinearity in time evolution equations (general relativity)
- Linearity fails, leading to wave function collapse and self-consistent distributions

**Self-corrective dynamics and biological organisms:**
- Remarkable homeostatic capabilities draw on self-interacting vacuum sea and manifest particles
- Carbon macromolecules, particularly proteins, support dynamic intricacy sufficient for unmasking collapse process

**Subjective psychological sense of freedom:**
- Referent for the feeling of freedom found in theory's structure
- Continual collapse of microdynamic possibility into macrodynamic actuality

**Important points**:
- Gravity: indirect interaction, emanating from less depressed regions of universe
- Linearity fails in time evolution equations (nonlinearity necessary for gravity)
- Self-corrective interactions crucial for organisms' homeostatic capabilities
- Fluctuon model provides a referent for the subjective psychological sense of freedom.

---

#### Qualia as Irreducible Experience in Quantum Theory

**Fluctuation Model in Physics: Eligibility Property and Qualia**

**Eligibility Property**:
- In a theory, elements that allow for qualia (qualities of subjective experience) as tenable but not obligatory referents are eligible.
- A theory without this property fails to satisfy the principle of philosophical relativity.
- This applies to theories that admit a fundamental status for an unpicturable "superpositional dynamics" stratum, rather than hidden variable theories which deny such a stratum.

**Qualia and Measurements**:
- Qualia are connected with all our measurements or assignments of quantitative measures to the external world.
- Attempting to completely characterize qualia by real numbers contradicts experience and violates the principle of philosophical relativity.
- For example, temperature cannot be reduced to average kinetic energy or other primary qualities like space and time.

**Arguments Against Eliminating Qualia**:
- Observations made by measuring instruments do not capture the organism's subjective experience of qualia (hotness, space, and time).
- Even if an observing system can perform measurements on itself, its own subjective experience remains gratuitous for functional capabilities.

**Importance of Qualia in Physical Theories**:
- Theories that violate the principle of philosophical relativity by collapsing everything into real numbers describing space and time may lead to inherently arguable conclusions about the ultimate nature of reality, such as subjective experience being non-existent or ephemeral.
- While we cannot positively define qualia, we can characterize them negatively through the eligibility property in physical theories claiming universality.

---

#### Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness Parallelism and Collapse in the Wave Function

**Quantum Mechanics and Eligibility for Qualia**

**Theories of Formal Elements:**
- Must possess richer formal elements than real numbers
- Cannot be reduced to real numbers without loss of essential aspect

**Classical System vs. Quantum Mechanics:**
- Classical system: collection of numbers representing positions and momenta
  - Describes statistical ensemble, not individual particle
- Quantum mechanics: complex functions describe possible states
  - Interference between possible states
  - Choice in converting to actual states
    * Collapse process involves randomness
    * No deterministic method for conversion without loss of essential aspect

**Quantum Mechanics and Real Time Capabilities:**
- Parallelism of possibilities confers eligibility to have qualities as referents
- Convert parallelism into speed of operation: impossible on average if all states have same energy
  * Different energies result in different vibrational frequencies
- Pattern of constructive and destructive interference changes over time, describing acceleration

**Probabilistic Approach:**
- Random decorrelation of phases associated with superposition
- Advantageous as it allows for predictive competence within the limitations of quantum mechanics

**Collapse-Embedding Approach:**
- Accommodates measurement process within time evolution
  * Viewed as a special case of an expanded dynamics
  - Advantageous for theories that project universality to satisfy this requirement.

#### Quantum-Classical Interface of Macromolecules Electronic-Conformational Interaction

**Understanding Quantum Reality: Percolation of Classical and Nonclassical Levels**

**Quantum Theory and Reality**
- Allows for existence of classical stratum, resolving quantum mechanics paradoxes
- Dominant factor in systems with time development controlled by microphysical particles

**Self-Consistency in Universe**
- Universe evolves towards mutual self-consistency between manifest and unmanifest distribution of vacuum particles
- Superpositional dynamics of microstructure speeds up self-corrective process

**Biological Organisms' Role**
- Proteins and other macromolecules provide crucial interface between classical and nonclassical levels
- Atomic nuclei are massive, so superpositional effects negligible; shape is dominant feature
- Electronic degrees of freedom are coupled (electronic-conformational interaction)

**Protein Functionality: Classical vs. Nonclassical Behavior**
- Shape and shape changes are classical concepts, controlled by electrons' superpositional dynamics
- Hydrogen bonds play role in electronic-conformational interaction
- Unpicturable microdynamics of electrons percolate up to functional capabilities of proteins

**Understanding Electronic-Conformational Interaction**
- Nuclei move in charge fields due to electrons and other nuclei
- Loosely bound electrons have separate wave functions (electronic and nuclear) that must be self-consistent.

---

#### Quantum Dynamics and Cellular Functionality Molecular Interactions in Biological Systems

**Theoretical Framework for Understanding Enzyme Functionality: Self-Assembly and Collapse of Quantum Parallelism**

**Electronic vs Nuclear Systems Interaction**
- Electronic system described as a superposition of electronic states due to perturbations from radiation field or substrate molecule collisions
- Interference effects occur, leading to charge distribution variations that agitate the nuclei
- Nuclear motions add to perturbation and spread out contributing states
- Self-amplifying process: thermal energy funneled to nuclear degrees of freedom through electronic system dynamics
- Unpicturable superpositional dynamics control picturable shape dynamics of enzyme
- No reduction of wave function at this stage

**Complex Formation and Decomposition**
- Mass of a single macromolecule doesn't alter vacuum structure enough to produce detectable deviations from reversibility in isolation
- Enzymes are never isolated; collapse occurs through interaction with other particles
- Random effects for the most part, but self-assembled complexes can lead to consistent minima and self-consistent complexes or dissociated states

**Superpositional Dynamics of Electronic System Speeds Up Complex Formation/Decomposition**
- Tightly bound electrons move in tandem with nuclear interactions
- Functional capabilities draw on superposition of unmanifest vacuum states for efficacy of self-corrective dynamics

**Cellular Level: Enzymes and Macromolecules Interface with Cell Influences**
- Two main tasks: regulate internal environment and respond appropriately to external membrane inputs
- Recognition and response to situational information coded in impinging influences on cell membrane
- Transduction of macroscopic features into internal physiochemical situations for processing by enzymes
- Receptors code external signals into internal messengers like cyclic AMP or steroid hormones
- Specific recognition capability of enzymes and structural proteins.

---

#### Self-Assembly and Communication Networks in Cells and Brain

**Context-Sensitive Pattern Recognition**
- Enzymes act based on multiple influences, including control molecules and physiochemical features
- Highly context-sensitive pattern recognizers due to classical-nonclassical interface (Conrad 1992b)
- Illustrated by self-assembly paradigm in Figure 35.1:
  * Different input lines activate different molecular conformations
  * Released molecules self-assemble into a poly-macromolecular mosaic, recoding the input pattern
  * Readout enzymes recognize common shape features and trigger events appropriate to input signals

**Self-Assembly Model in Biochemical Processing**
- Self-assembly of initially separate molecules not essential
- Conformational reorganization of controlling biochemical process molecule in response to context
- Passive control properties of cell maintained through local context sensitivity
- Longer distance mechanisms for coordination and communication: cytoskeleton, membrane, phonons, coherent dynamics, mobile hydrogen bonds (Matsumoto and Sakal 1979 - Chen and Conrad 1994)

**Further Up Scale to the Brain: Percolation Network Model**
- Vast array of dynamic processes in biological capabilities
- Brain built up as a vast neural network with transformer neurons
- Each neuron transforms input patterns to output patterns based on transduction dynamics and readout enzymes
- Signal integration and readout steps may occur before final activation step determining neuronal firing.

---

#### Percolation Networks and Consciousness A Self-Enclosed Transduction Model

**Dynamic Universality and Consciousness:**

**Perception-Action Capabilities**:
- Organism's capabilities depend on recognition-action capabilities of neurons
- Neuron connectivity and switching properties are not as important as the recognition-action capabilities

**Brain Function Analogy**:
- Brain functions cannot be understood by connectivity and switching properties alone
- Human decisions play a crucial role in mediating network activities

**Recognition-Action Capabilities of Macromolecules**:
- Recognition-action capabilities are the main factor for enabling recognition-action capabilities of neurons
- Classical/nonclassical interface plays a critical role in enabling macromolecular interactions

**Quantum Parallelism and Percolation Networks**:
- Microphysical dynamics "percolates up" to control picturable actions of the organism
- Macroscopic influences from the environment set microstate of the cell
- Main processing occurs at molecular level where mesophysical and microphysical features are close

**Consciousness and Privacy**:
- Transduction-amplification chains that link macro to micro are unique, making merger between systems unlikely
- Distinction between measurement (object) and subjective experience (subject) is important
- Self-enclosed transduction-amplification cycles have the required properties for consciousness: collapse processes, superpositional dynamics, and integrative internal couplings.

**Biological Organisms vs. Universe**:
- Biological organisms are homomorphic images of the whole universe but operate in a constraint-dominated regime.

---

#### Semantic Capability of Systems Supporting Self-Enclosed Transduction Cycles

**Framework for Understanding Consciousness and Self-Consciousness**

**Distinction between Consciousness and Self-Consciousness**:
- No difference, as a subject can only be conscious of itself
- A subject is influenced by external factors, but aware of them through its own state changes
- Complex systems like organisms cannot be fully aware of their entire structure due to the need for singular action selection

**Top Level Self-Awareness**:
- Only the top level transduction-amplification cycle is associated with self-awareness
- Other processes and actions are suppressed or funneled into this top level
- This top level is not aware of other, competing self-awarenesses

**Variations in Biological Forms and Qualia**:
- Vast variety of biological forms possible
- Different organizations may have distinct qualia
- Endless variety of qualia in the universe

**Limitations of Digital Computers**:
- Cannot have qualia or afford subjective experiences due to classical computation
- Errors can occur, but are quenched by fault tolerance measures
- Inability to simulate semantic capabilities

**Implications for Simulating the World**:
- Classical systems cannot fully replicate percolation and collapse of superpositional dynamics
- Ability to simulate all behaviors requires accounting for referents in computer programs, which are not inherently meaning-bearing
- Self-enclosed transduction-amplification cycles are eligible to be viewed as subjects as well as objects.

#### Philosophical Relativity and the Quantum Challenge

**Wittgenstein's Sign Argument**
- Rephrased in terms of Wittgenstein's pointing finger sign (1953)
- Meaning is extrinsic to the object itself, interpreted by a subject
- Sign serves as an amplification cycle for percolation and collapse of wave function
- Performing functions beyond formal models like Turing machines
- Important functional capability: semantic capability

**Philosophical Relativity and Conventionalism in Science**
- Connection between philosophical relativity and conventionalist philosophy of science (Poincar, 1946)
- Modification of space and time not required by relativity theories
- Choice between simple descriptions or complicated geometries/forces
- Motivated by considerations of conceptual simplicity, ease of mathematics, and experimental data
- Fluctuon model of force as an example: complex geometry vs. virtual particle exchange model
- Interpretation of density structure in terms of objectively existing space and time or subjective qualities is a matter of choice

**Extension of Physics to Phenomenon of Mind**
- New element: predictions not independent of arguable interpretations
- Introduction of constructs for transforming between interpretive "coordinate systems" without altering empirically testable content
- Freedom vs. necessity issue addressed by quantum theory's superposition and collapse features
- Potential for more complicated hidden variable theories with unsatisfactory philosophical entailments
- Principle of philosophical relativity: structure of scientific theories should not entail solutions to undecidable philosophical questions, allowing alternative interpretations that are defensible by credible arguments.

---

#### Philosophical Relativity and Quantum Theory

**Philosophical Relativity vs. Conventionalism**
- **Philosophical relativity**: introduces constructs without empirical correspondents to avoid entailing arguable interpretations, preserving/increasing empirical comprehensiveness; satisfies philosophical relativity when there's a class of theories with equal empirical coverage and antinomic interpretations
- **Conventionalism**: accepts that theoretical constructs have multiple interpretations until a comprehensive theory is established; allows for argument over the nature of reality, even if it's not empirically testable

**Addressing Consciousness and Philosophical Relativity with Percolation-Collapse Framework**
- Formulated in terms of constructs open to mental referents whose ontological status can be interpreted
- Allows for various philosophical perspectives, as long as they are consistently coordinated with the theory elements
- Doesn't mean these views are meaningless or non-preferable; issues should be isolated from empirical claims
- Principle of philosophical relativity: an ideal to eliminate implications not empirically testable by adding constructs to theories claiming universality. Not the same as positivist criteria for truth through either empirical testing or mathematical deduction.
- Viewed as heuristics for constructing theories addressing domains where philosophical issues are complex, like consciousness

**Philosophical Relativity Criteria and Ideal**
- To achieve philosophical relativity ideal: separate perspective choice from general scheme of physics
- Distinguishing statements bound to a perspective vs. empirically decidable independent of perspective might be difficult or impossible; agreement on absolute criteria may not be obtainable
- Philosophical relativization is an ideal, roughly analogous to separating reference frame choice for measurements from the general physics scheme
- Criteria laid out are heuristics valuable for constructing theories addressing domains where philosophical issues are complex, like consciousness.

* Structural requirement for consciousness necessitates an all-at-once occurrence, challenging the functionalist view.

---

#### Quantum Coherence and Consciousness in Biology A Microtubule Model

**Locality and Consciousness**
- Local objects can only have limited complexity due to the requirement of locality
- Information transfer between locales is by signaling, not affecting local object complexity
- Classical consciousness is impoverished in terms of structure compared to phenomena observed
- Focus on single atoms or molecules as models for consciousness is unlikely
- Nonlocal coherence phenomena are essential for a nonclassical explanation of consciousness
- Quantum field theory introduced to address issues with locality and structure in consciousness studies

**Mental Experience vs. Computational Devices**
- Internal mental processes are accepted as distinct from computational devices that mimic them
- Connectionist models fail to explain how neurons yield mental experience or noncomputational aspects of consciousness
- Temporal binding only affects the dispositions of neurons, not fundamental questions about consciousness
- Denying qualitative aspects of consciousness flies in the face of phenomenological data

**Biological Systems and Quantum Coherence**
- Application of quantum concepts to the brain has been met with skepticism
- Biological systems exhibit macroscopic ordered states that cannot be explained classically
- Frohlich's demonstration of population inversion for high-temperature systems opened the way for discussions of quantum coherence in biology

**Modeling Electromagnetic Fields and Water Molecules**
- Simple model constructed of electromagnetic field interacting with quantum rotors (water molecules) lining microtubule walls
- Electric dipole moment JL allows water molecule many energy eigenstates, only two principal ones considered

#### Quantum Optical Coherence in Subcellular Systems Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Model

**Two-Level System and Quantum Dynamics**
* The Pauli spin operators and unit matrix are used to describe linear, Hermitian operators of a two-level system
* The Hamiltonian for a system of N noninteracting water molecules is given by equation (1) in the text

**Frohlich's Work and Cytoskeleton Systems**
* Frohlich's work and corticon of Stuart, Takahashi, and Umezawa (1978, 1979) inspire a model for quantum optical coherence in cytoskeleton structures like microtubules
* Ordered water around and within these structures can be brought about by low electric fields under biological conditions (Hasted et al., 1983)
* Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the fundamental concept linking stable macroscopic objects to quantum field theory
* Structured water and protein are ordered states, realized in the interaction between electromagnetic and matter fields, constituting domains of order that result from violating translational and rotational symmetries

**Subcellular Model for Quantum Optical Coherence**
* Electric field strength operator is linearly polarized along a unit vector e
* Expanded in normal modes as E+ k(E- k) with positive (E+ k) and negative (E- k) frequency parts
* Dipole approximation is appropriate for describing the interaction between electromagnetic field and electric dipole moments
* Sum of equations (1), (2), and (4) has an invariance under E:.:-+ E+i8k, but this invariance is not respected by the vacuum state, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking and macroscopic ordered state establishment
* Goldstone bosons, associated with structural water and protein, emerge from spontaneous symmetry breakdown and allow for massless quanta to be easily excited
* Spontaneously broken theories exhibit Goldstone modes, which correlate vacua chosen by elements of an extended system and order the vacuum.

#### Quantum Coherence in Biomolecules Subcellular Optical Superradiance

**Theoretical Framework**
- **Degenerate vacuum**: Any set of values of component fields that spontaneously break symmetry result in a degenerate vacuum
- **Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB)**: Explicitly incorporated as excitation of Goldstone mode
- **Superradiance**: Long-range ordering phenomenon in ensemble of water molecules
- **Coherence length**: Estimated by inverse energy difference
- **Intensity of photon emissions**: Proportional to N2, a hallmark of superradiance

**Microtubule and Water Molecules Interaction**
- **Collective dynamics**: Water molecules follow the collective dynamics of quantum electromagnetic field through SSB mechanism
- **Condensation of photons**: Interaction with water induces condensation of photons in single quantum state, making electromagnetic field coherent
- **Long-range correlation**: Interaction with quantized electromagnetic field sets up long-range correlation among water molecules

**Self-Induced Transparency (SIT)**
- **Coherence length**: Determines intensity to be proportional to N2, a hallmark of superradiance
- **Semiclassical calculation**: Yields 500 aI: Subcellular Optical Superradiance
- **Inhomogeneous Maxwell equation**: Reduces to sine-Gordon equation in 1+1 dimensions for linearly polarized electric field
- **Solitonic solutions**: Propagate without dispersion, maintaining shape

**Implications on Biological Systems**
- **Self-induced transparency**: Neutralizes pulse spreading and distortion due to thermal environment
- **Nonlinear optical effects**: Distortionless pulse obtained is a special case of nonlinear optical effects in an inhomogeneously broadened two-quantum system
- **Coherent photons**: May have sufficient intensity to initiate protein conformational changes, gating transmembrane ionic diffusions, and allowing quantum mechanism to control classical neural functions through coherence.

#### Quantum Coherence and Subcellular Consciousness in Neurons

**Memory and Consciousness: Quantum Coherence in Proteins**

**Support for Memory by Vacuum:**
- Phonons support memory through macroscopic ordering effect
- Consciousness constituted in excitation dynamics of photons and phonons

**Quantum Processes and Classical Domain:**
- Electromagnetic field yields back reaction in protein dipolar fields
- Quantum coherence coordinates emission of coherent photons in microtubules
- Coherent neuronal firing among widely dispersed neurons possible

**Anesthesia and Microtubules:**
- General anesthetics bind weakly to hydrophobic regions of proteins
- Inhibit mechanism of superradiance, leading to opacity in microtubular pathways
- Reversal of anesthesia by pressure can be understood as restoration of transparency due to increased activity
- Anesthetics bind directly to microtubules and disrupt protein-water field dynamics

**Indirect Evidence for Coherent Photon Emission:**
- Superradiance and self-induced transparency in certain tissues emit anomalous coherent photons above thermal background
- Positive results obtained through various studies, as listed in Li et al. (1983)

**Clarifications:**
- Entire universe is expected to be quantum theoretical but not at issue here
- Recent observation of high Tc superconductors makes this speculation outdated
- Finite size effects and long-range forces do not alter conclusions regarding coherence in proteins.

### 37 Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum Coherence in Brain Microtubules A Model of Consciousness

**Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum Coherence in Brain Microtubules: A Model for Consciousness**

**Introduction**:
- Current neurophysiological explanations of consciousness suggest it is a manifestation of emergent firing patterns in neuronal groups
- Precise correlation of neuronal firing patterns with cognitive activities fails to address perplexing differences between mind and brain, including the "hard problem" of the nature of our inner experience
- In this paper, we apply certain aspects of quantum theory (quantum coherence) and a new physical phenomenon described in Penrose (1994) (wave function self-collapse or objective reduction: OR) to specific, essential structures within each neuron: cytoskeletal microtubules

**Quantum Theory**:
- Quantum theory describes the surprising behavior at a fundamental level of matter and energy that comprise our universe
- Atoms and their components exhibit wave/particle duality
- A quantum system, such as an atom or subatomic particle, behaves as a "wave of possibilities" and exists in coherent "superposition" (with complex number coefficients) of many possible states when isolated from its environment

**Conventional Quantum Theory View**:
- The quantum state reduces by environmental entanglement, measurement, or conscious observation ("subjective reduction: SR" or R)
- Precisely where a quantum particle is and how it is moving when observed is "indeterminate", resulting in random measured values

**Penrose's Proposed New Physical Ingredient (Objective Reduction: OR)**:
- A new physical ingredient is needed to address the issue of quantum state reduction
- In the OR scheme, the collapse outcomes ("eigenstates") need not be random, but can reflect a quantum computation occurring in the coherent superposition state
- Quantum systems exhibit "quantum inseparability" or nonlocality, implying that all quantum objects that have once interacted are still connected and instantaneously influence each other

**Potential Sites for Quantum Effects in the Brain**:
- Various authors have implicated ion channels, ions themselves, DNA, presynaptic grids, and cytoskeletal microtubules as mediating standard quantum effects
- Cytoskeletal microtubules are the most likely sites for quantum coherence, OR, and consciousness
- Theoretical models suggest that conformational states of tubulins within microtubule lattices can interact with neighboring tubulins to represent, propagate, and process information as in molecular-level "cellular automata" computing systems

---

#### Quantum Consciousness Theory Orchestrated Reduction of Microtubule Coherence in Brain Neurons

**Model Linking Microtubules to Consciousness using Quantum Theory**
- **Model presented**: Hameroff and Penrose (1992) propose a model linking microtubules to consciousness using quantum theory as described in Shadows of the Mind (Penrose, 1994).

**Key Concepts:**
- **Quantum Coherence**: Emerges and is isolated in brain microtubules until differences in mass-energy distribution among superpositioned tubulin states reach a threshold related to quantum gravity.
- **Orchestrated Reduction (OR)**: The resultant self-collapse creates an instantaneous "now" event, leading to consciousness. MAPs on microtubules "tune" quantum oscillations and orchestrate possible collapse outcomes.

**The Gap in Physics Knowledge:**
- **Conventional Copenhagen Interpretation**: Does not consider quantum collapse as an objectively real phenomenon.
- **Alternative Models of OR**: Proposed by physicists to fill this gap, including Penrose's proposal where quantum coherence grows until it reaches a critical threshold related to quantum gravity and abruptly self-collapses.

**Properties of Quantum Brain Structures:**
- Ideal properties for structures relevant to consciousness include: high prevalence, functional importance, periodic structure with long-range order, ability to be transiently isolated from external interaction/observation, functionally coupled to quantum level events, and suitable for information processing.
- Microtubules appear to have these requisite properties.

**Support for OR in Microtubules:**
- Recent work lends support on general and observational grounds for a gravitational OR scheme.
- Arguments from other directions suggest that the union of general relativity with quantum mechanics will lead to a significant change in both theories.
- Tentative evidence suggests that this union is a noncomputable theory.

**The Proposed Model: Orchestrated Reduction (Orch OR)**
- Hameroff and Penrose propose that OR in microtubules relevant to consciousness is guided and tuned by connecting MAPs, creating a model of "orchestrated OR" (Orch OR) in microtubules which may support consciousness.

---

#### Microtubules and Consciousness in Quantum Computation

**Features of Objective Reduction (OR) and Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum Coherence (Orch OR)**
- Noncomputable aspects arise only in large quantum systems undergoing self-collapse rather than growth-induced entanglement with the environment
- Consciousness requires noncomputability, which is not available in standard quantum theory's random R process
- Large-scale quantum-coherent state maintained for a considerable time is essential for OR (Orch OR) to occur through self-collapse and influence brain function

**Microtubules as Potential Place for OR Requirements**
- Promising place for large-scale quantum coherence maintenance
- Cytoskeleton components: microtubules, actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and MAPs
- Microtubules (MTs) are hollow cylinders nanometers in diameter with lengths varying from short to quite long within some nerve axons
- MT walls comprised of 13 longitudinal protofilaments made up of tubulin dimers, which consist of alpha and beta monomers
- Hexagonal lattice structure results in differing neighbor relationships among subunits and helical pathways
- Dipoles with negative charges localized toward the monomers make MTs "electrets" with piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties
- Biochemical energy provided to cytoskeleton through tubulin bound GTP hydrolysis and MAP phosphorylation
- MTs self-assemble and disassemble, determining cell form and function including synaptic connections in neurons

**Cytoskeletal Involvement in Cognition**
- Long-term potentiation (LTP) involves dephosphorylated MAP-2, an MT-crosslinking MAP, as a model for learning and memory
- Visual stimulation causes dephosphorylation of MAP-2 in cat visual cortex
- Auditory Pavlovian conditioning elevates temporal cortex MAP-2 activity in rats
- Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of MAP-2 accounts for a large proportion of brain biochemical energy consumption and is involved in functions such as potentiating excitatory synaptic pathways

**Other Evidence Linking the Cytoskeleton with Cognitive Function**
- Production of tubulin and MT activities correlate with peak learning, memory, and experience in baby chick brains
- Neurons produce vast quantities of tubulin when baby rats first open their eyes
- Degree of cognitive damage correlates with decreased levels of dendritic MAP-2 in animals temporarily deprived of oxygen
- Selective damage to MTs by the drug colchicine causes learning and memory defects mimicking Alzheimer's disease symptoms, possibly due to microtuble dysfunction and axonal MAP "tau protein" tangles.

#### Quantum Coherence in Proteins and Microtubules

**Microtubule Information Processing: Hameroff and Penrose's Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum Coherence (1986)**

**Background:**
- Roth and Pihlaja (1977): tubulin conformation patterns represent information
- Proteins have conformational transitions at various time scales
  - Small side chains: picosecond to femtosecond
  - Global changes, protein function: nanosecond to picoseconds
- Factors regulating protein conformation: phosphorylation, ATP/GTP hydrolysis, ion fluxes, electric fields, ligand binding, allosteric influences

**Frohlich's Theory:**
- Quantum coherence in living cells (1968, 1970, 1975)
- Protein conformation linked to hydrophobic quantum events
- Coherent excitations from biochemical and thermal energy
- Cooperative process leading to coherent excitations due to structural coherence of hydrophobic dipoles in a common voltage gradient

**Evidence for Frohlich-like Coherent Excitations:**
1. Observation of gigaHz-range phonons in proteins (Genberg et al., 1991)
2. Sharp resonant nonthermal effects of microwave irradiation on living cells (Grundler and Keilmann, 1983)
3. GigaHz-induced activation of microtubule pinocytosis in rat brain (Neubauer et al., 1990)
4. Raman spectroscopy detection of Frohlich frequency energy (Genzel et al., 1983)

**Cellular Automata:**
- Complex signaling patterns emerge from local activities of simple subunits
- Essential features: finite number of states, fixed geometry, universal clock, neighbor communication, transition rules depending on present state and neighbors
- Can function as Turing machines (Neumann, 1966)
- Frohlich excitations used as a clocking mechanism and electrostatic dipole coupling forces as transition rules for cellular automata behavior within MTs.

---

#### Quantum Computation in Microtubules and Consciousness

**Microtubules and Cellular Automata Patterns**
- MT automata simulations show conformational behaviors: standing waves, oscillators, gliders
- Velocities range from 8 to meters per second, similar to nerve action potential velocity
- MT patterns represent information through each cell; may convey signals that regulate synaptic connectionist architecture
- Information can be "hardened" in MTs or stored in neurofilaments via MAPs

**Quantum Coherence and OR Criterion**
- In standard quantum theory, superpositions of two distinguishable quantum states persist forever without environmental entanglement
- According to the present OR criterion, such superpositions are unstable even without environmental entanglement
- The state w I A> + z I B> will decay in a certain time scale T (analogous to radioactive particle decay) to either 1 A> or 1 B>, with relative probabilities 1 w^2 : 1 z^2
- This idea is that the well-defined energy distributions and space-time geometries of states 1 A> and 1 B> differ from the combination wi A> + zlB>
- Gravitational self-energy E determines spontaneous reduction (at time T) of superposed combination to either 1 A> or 1 B>

**Conscious Thought and Quantum Coherence**
- Pre- and subconscious processing correspond with quantum coherent superposition, which can perform "quantum computing"
- A state that "self-collapses" (OR) has an element of noncomputability, while a state collapsed by external observation (SR) lacks this property
- Large scale quantum coherence among tubulins could take on aspects of a quantum computer in preconscious and subconscious modes
- Nonconscious processes correspond with classical, nonquantum computing by microtubule conformational automata

**Time Scales and Consciousness**
- Time T, at which the state w I A> + zlB> decays to either 1 A> or 1 B>, relates to transition between preconscious and conscious events
- Experimental results suggest a time scale of about 500 milliseconds for functionally significant transitions between preconscious and conscious processing

**Consciousness and Space-Time Geometry**
- Consciousness may involve self-perturbations of space-time geometry, related to quantum gravity
- Extent of space-time superposition causing self-collapse is equal to one in "absolute units"

#### Quantum Coherent Superposition and Orchestrated Reduction in Tubulin

**Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum Coherence (OR)**

**Constants**:
- c (speed of light) = 1
- hA (Planck's constant divided by 2) = 1
- G (gravitational constant) = 1

**Physical Units in Absolute Units**:
- Second = 1.9 x 10^43 nanometer = 6.3 x 10^25 mass of nucleon ("dalton")
- Fermi (strong interaction size, diameter of nucleon) = 6.3 x 10^19

**Tubulin Dimer**:
- Mass of one tubulin monomer sphere is 55,000 daltons (nucleons)
- In absolute units: mt = 5.5 x 10^-15 kg

**Gravitational Self-Energy E**:
- For a quantum superposition of mass whose displacement for a given time T sufficiently perturbs space-time for OR, is taken from the "uncertainty principle"

**Tubulin Conformational Change**:
- Could be considered as two granular arrays of:
  - Atoms (Figure 37.6a)
  - Nucleons (neutrons and protons, Figure 37.6b,c)

**Calculations**:
- For a tubulin dimer, energy Et is twice the displacement energy of one monomer sphere in the gravitational field of its other position
- For a carbon nucleus (12 nucleons), the self-energy Ec is given by: 2Ec = G/r^3

**Estimates for Number of Tubulins**:
- Considering tubulin as two protein spheres: 6 x 10^13 tubulins displaced in quantum coherent superposition for 500 ms will self-collapse (OR)
- As granular arrays of carbon atoms or nucleons: 1.1 x 10^5 to 5 x 10^9 tubulins displaced in quantum coherent superposition for 500 ms will self-collapse (OR)

**Significance of the Number of Tubulins**:
- The possible significance of this number of tubulins will be discussed later.

---

#### Quantum Coherence in Microtubules and Isolation Mechanisms

**Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum Coherence**

**Connection Between Consciousness and Instantaneous "Now"**:
- Consciousness may be linked to creation of an instantaneous "now"
- The flow of time can be influenced by the Orch OR process in microtubules (MTs)

**Role of MTs in Consciousness**:
- MTs select patterns (eigenstates of mass distribution) of tubulin conformational states through Orch OR
- These selected patterns can influence neural function and determine initial conditions for information processing
- MT activities can govern intraneuronal architecture, synaptic function, communication with genetic material, and axoplasmic transport

**MAPS and Orchestration of Quantum Coherence**:
- MAPs attached to certain microtubule tubulin subunits could communicate the quantum state to the outside environment
- This entanglement and collapse (SR or R rather than OR) can be orchestrated by MAPs and other factors
- These Orch OR processes in MTs may exhibit puzzling bidirectional time flow prior to self-collapse

**Isolating Quantum Coherence in Microtubules**:
- Quantum coherence inside microtubules can be isolated from environmental entanglement using the hollow core of microtubules
- Superradiance allows for the transformation of disordered energy into coherent photons within the microtubule core
- Transient and reversible conversion of the cytoplasmic solution (Soi) to gel (gelatinous) phases can isolate microtubules during quantum coherence

---

#### Quantum Coherence in Microtubules and Consciousness

**Quantum Effects in Living Cells: Microtubules and Structured Water**
* Quantum effects are unlikely to occur in noisy thermal motions of cell water
* Factors could sustain quantum coherence in microtubules (MTs)
  + Ordered water extending up to nine layers around each MT can be highly ordered
  + Interactions between ordered water molecules and MT surface have higher frequency than thermalization energy
  + Self-focusing of filamentous energy beams with radii of nanometers precisely fits inner diameter of microtubules
* Collapse Fraction for Orchestrated Reduction (Orch OR)
  * 109 tubulins in quantum coherent superposition for 500 ms are sufficient for Orch OR and consciousness
  * Minimal number of neurons: hundreds to thousands, depending on fraction of coherent tubulins within a set
* Neuronal Networks and Consciousness
  + Nervous systems range from hundreds to thousands of neurons
  + Different types of conscious experience may result in varying time and number of tubulins required for Orch OR.

#### Quantum Coherence in Brain Microtubules and Orchestrated Reduction OR Hypothesis for Consciousness

**Orchestered Objective Reduction (ORCH OR) of Quantum Coherence in Brain Microtubules**

**Ingredients:**
- Macroscopic state of quantum coherent superposition among tubulin subunits in microtubules across the brain
  - Proposed models: Marshall (1989), Jibu et al. (1994), Kaivarainen (1994), Conrad (1992, 1994)
- Weakly coupled to conformational activity in tubulins within microtubules
  - Changes in electric dipole moments of tubulins link the quantum state and conformational activity
- Coherent state maintained without significant entanglement with environment for relevant period (up to 500 ms)
  - Mechanisms isolating MT quantum state: shielding by ordered water, isolation within hollow cores, shielding by gelatinous cytoplasmic layer
- Cooperative interactions among neighboring tubulins
  - Signal and process information through computational mechanisms such as cellular automata behavior
- Two types of microtubule computation: classical computing (conformational patterns propagate) and quantum computing (large-scale coherence occurs among tubulins)
  - Equated with nonconscious and autonomic activities vs. pre- and subconscious processing, respectively
- Changes in dimer conformations involve mass movement during Orchestrated Objective Reduction (OR) process
- Estimated time scale T (up to 500 ms) and number of coherent superpositioned tubulins required for OR to occur
- MAPs attached to certain microtubule subunits communicate quantum state to outside environment, entangle and collapse it (SR or R)
- Orch OR process selects new set of tubulin conformational states that can implement neural function by determining MAP attachment sites and setting initial conditions for classical information processing
- Copenhagen quantum interpretation suggests selection of states upon collapse is random; effects of MAPs, genetic and other modifications "orchestrate" the OR process.
- Possibility of presently unrecognized quantum-mathematical logic acting on programming influences to provide hidden order in the Orch OR process.
- Nonlocal nature of OR phenomena may exhibit puzzling bidirectional time flow prior to self-collapse.

#### Quantum Consciousness Orchestrated Reduction of Tubulins in Microtubules as the Basis for Stream of Consciousness

**Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) Model for Consciousness**

**Hameroff and Penrose Approach to Understanding Consciousness:**
- Fails to explain critical aspects: binding, noncomputational thinking, preconscious vs conscious processing, free will, essence of experience.
- Quantum coherence and wave function self-collapse (objective reduction, OR) offer potential solutions.

**Assumptions:**
1. Coherent excitations among microtubule subunits support classical and quantum information processing.
2. Classical processing correlates with nonconscious activity; quantum processing with preconscious or subconscious processing.
3. Quantum coherent computing phase can be isolated from environmental interaction and maintain coherence for up to 500 ms (preconscious processing).
4. Critical number of tubulins collapsing their wave function through OR to prevent multiple universes: roughly 10^9 tubulins.
5. Cascades of Orch OR events create the familiar "stream of consciousness".
6. MAPs and other tubulin modifications act as inodes to tune microtubule coherence and help orchestrate collapse (Orch OR).
7. Orch OR introduces noncomputability, providing a connection between preconscious to conscious transition, fundamental space-time notions, noncomputability, and binding of various superpositions into an instantaneous "now".
8. The most specific and plausible model for consciousness yet proposed.

## VIII Nonlocal Space and Time

**Hameroff and Penrose: Orchestrated Reduction of Quantum Coherence**

**Background:**
- Hameroff and Penrose propose theory connecting consciousness with quantum physics, general relativity, and information theory
- Unifying all known forces to define the geometry of space-time
- Ancient idea: Plato's cave metaphor for multidimensional reality
- Consciousness may utilize a simplifying projection into three-dimensional space

**Grand Unification Schemes:**
- Proposed solutions to unify quantum theory, general relativity, and other forces
- No single scheme widely accepted yet
- Suggestions: David Bohm's implicate order, hyperspheres, quantum foam, twistors, string theory

**Time and Consciousness:**
- In conventional physics and relativity theory, there is no passage of time or universal simultaneity
- Our conscious experience is different: time flows with a "Now" that continuously moves forward
- Consciousness and time's passage are interconnected mystery (Elitzur)
- Quantum wave function collapse linked to consciousness creation by Tollaksen
- Collapse outcomes and consciousness influenced from both past and future.

### 38 Time and Consciousness The Uneasy Bearing of Relativity Theory on the Mind-Body Problem

**Relativity Theory and Consciousness: The Uneasy Relationship**

**Time and Consciousness**:
- Our experience reflects something about the nature of time
- Relativity theory has complicated the relationship between subjective experience and physical formalism
- Time is a fundamental aspect of our experience, constantly changing

**The Passing of Time**:
- Time seems to pass relative to us
- Elementary logic shows that statements about time passing are absurd
- Physics ignores time's passage, treating it as a parameter in physical laws

**Relativity Theory and the Nature of Time**:
- Relativity theory undermines the notion of "Now" and simultaneity
- An observer on a distant planet would designate the same moment differently than an observer on Earth
- Relativity assigns equal validity to events being "present," "future," or "past"

**Philosophical Challenges**:
- Philosophers have argued that time is subject to creative "becoming" that physics cannot capture
- These philosophical ideas are not taken seriously by mainstream science due to the mathematical rigor and logical beauty of relativity theory

#### Perception Consciousness and Time A Physics Perspective on the Interplay of Mental and Physical Experiences

**Consciousness and the Limits of Neurophysiological Description**
* Problem: Conscious experience not fully captured by neurophysiological descriptions
+ Complete description would only include physical interactions between neurons, but something is missing
+ Cannot rule out possibility that person has no conscious experience, or it's different from observer's
* Information theory perspective: Universe versus notion of "Becoming"
+ Sensation of color cannot be absolutely certain across individuals
+ No experiment can confirm another person's conscious experience
+ Intuitive certainty not justified by present-day science

**The Role of Consciousness in Behavior**
* Theories seeking to reconcile consciousness with physics render it causally ineffective
* Argument: Only physical events should cause other physical events
* Counterexample: Actions indicating puzzlement about consciousness cannot be adequately explained by a purely physical account
+ From rare instances, conclusion is extended to all forms of behavior where purely physical explanation seems sufficient
+ Consciousness contributes causal influence in these cases
* Argument has been elaborated and endorsed by others since original publication (Elitzur 1989, 1996a)

**Relativity Theory's Connection to Consciousness**
* Relativity theory: Greatest achievement of modern physics
* Application to consciousness: Mental events must also take place in space-time, hence are identical with physical events
+ Alternative bearing: Relativity ignores time's passage, which could be relevant to understanding the relationship between consciousness and physical phenomena.

#### Time and Consciousness A Unified Perspective of Becoming

**Theory of Time and Consciousness**
- **Einstein's Attitude Towards Unity of Consciousness**: Einstein's statement that "There is no irreversibility in the basic laws of physics" leads to ignoring the unity of consciousness. He later wrote a letter consoling Besso's family after his death, expressing that the distinction between past, present, and future is an illusion.
- **The Relativistic Picture**: In relativistic physics, each individual person is a world-line extending from birth to death. The "present 1" is just an arbitrarily chosen section of this four-dimensional world-line, which is static and changeless.
- **Experience of the Now**: Consciousness and time's passage seem to be two aspects of the same mystery, as consciousness is restricted to the fleeting present while being inherent in any possible experience yet so alien to physics.
- **Towards a New Theory of Time and Consciousness**
  - The author has been studying the foundations of quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and the mind-body problem over the last decade.
  - A new theory called "space-time dynamics" is emerging, which extends the present relativistic framework to include Becoming in the physical formalism.
  - This theory ascribes real evolution to time itself, with space-time growing in the future direction and events being created anew as the "Now" progresses.
  - The author suggests that this Becoming is the long-sought-for master asymmetry underlying the diverse "arrows of time" in physics.

### 39 New Insights from Quantum Theory on Time Consciousness and Reality

**New Insights from Quantum Theory for Consciousness**

**Background:**
- Classical physics vs. quantum mechanics (QM) in understanding consciousness
- Inadequacies of current interpretations of QM for explaining fundamental phenomena like the EPR/Aspect experiments and time

**Unique Features of Quantum Mechanics:**
- Superposition: possibilities combine interdependently, unlike classical physics
- Probability calculation involves complex partial amplitudes and interference terms

**Challenges in Classical Physics:**
- William James: holism of brain states not explainable by reductionistic classical physics
- Nonlocality or nonseparability in quantum mechanics: evidenced by correlated systems that cannot be explained by local-realistic theories

**Implications for Consciousness:**
- Holism: essential unity of psychic and physical counterparts
- New perspective on the measurement problem: nonlocal reality, not entirely random or stochastic (Stapp's double-aspect theory)

**Aharonov and Rohrlich Formulation:**
- Resolves deepest paradoxes of QM, such as nonlocality and wave function meaning
- New insights for understanding consciousness: time, experienced flow, unity, phenomenal qualities, free will.

**Conclusion:**
- Quantum mechanics offers new perspectives and insights into the scientific study of consciousness, particularly with regard to its unique features like nonlocality and superposition. The formulation by Aharonov and Rohrlich successfully resolves some of the challenges posed by QM for understanding reality.

#### Quantum Measurement Dilemmas and Collapse of the Wave Function

**Heisenberg Actual Event and Consciousness:**
- At a physical level, actual event is passive: new set of tendencies comes into being (Heisenberg)
- In context of present ontology, event must be construed actively: shift in tendencies actualized
- Feel identified as active aspect, veridical consciousness experience of efficacy (Abner Shimony agrees)

**Measurement Problem:**
- Relationship between quantum measurement problem and consciousness
- Review of important issues in measurement theory
- Stem-Gerlach magnet experiment: spin up vs. superposition states
- Subjective experience contradicts superposition states
- Uncertainty about which version is correct

**Theory of Collapse:**
- Need to select one version among two (A's or B's)
- No dynamics suggest which version to choose
- Time symmetry in measurement theory: Aharonov's solution via probability measure under conditionalization
- Clue 1: Correlated spin state and observers A and B
- Clue 2: Projection postulate or collapse of wave function
- Clue 3: Nonlocal aspects and local aspects of collapse
- Clue 4: Irreversible recording of measurement outcome (Mandel's experiments)
- Misconceptions about collapse occurring at MD level due to practical difficulties.

---

#### Quantum Consciousness and Observer-Participancy in Time

**Experiments in Quantum Physics: Role of the Observer-Participant**

**Quantum Theory and the GRW theory**:
- Proposed spontaneous collapses of quantum state onto eigenstates
- Rate of collapse and width chosen so that single particle will almost never collapse
- However, if there are a large number of entangled particles, wave function collapses quickly

**Stern-Gerlach Experiment**:
- Proposed by Albert and Vaidman to find at what point the collapse occurs in the GRW theory
- Collapse did not occur until the wave function interacted with the brain of the observer

**The Role of the Observer as Participant**
- John Wheeler's analogy of "The Game of Twenty Questions"
- Illustrates physics in its classical and quantum formulations
- World does not exist independently; meaning is derived from observer-participancy
- Reality is only the outcomes of measurements, with speculation about quantum system between them being meaningless

**Time as an Illusion**:
- Modern science denies time's fundamental importance, yet it plays a crucial role in our lives
- Einstein denied the transitory nature of time based on his theory of time as the fourth dimension
- If time's passage is illusory, our feeling of having a single, unitary self must also be an illusion
- However, this goes against practical experience and is at odds with it

**Conclusion**:
- Reality can only be discussed in terms of measurement outcomes
- Quantum state itself and expectation values of observables should be attributed reality
- The observer-participant plays a crucial role in the selection of both the destiny state and the observable
- Yakir Aharonov's statement: "Don't think of measurement as just determining what we don't know. The real issue of measurement theory is determining what can manifest itself."

---

#### Time Reversal and Weak Values in Quantum Mechanics

**Two-Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics**

**Protected Experiment and Wave Function Meaning:**
- Aharonov et al. propose a new type of experiment (protected) that measures full wave function for single particle without collapsing it.
- Two interpretations of wave function: physical reality in two-vector theory vs. nonphysical existence in Copenhagen interpretation.

**Avoidance of Problems:**
- Violation of causality and charge conservation can be avoided with the adoption of two-vector theory.
- Present is created out of influences from both past and future.

**Two State Vectors:**
- Description of quantum systems using two state vectors: history state (initial conditions) and destiny state (future boundary conditions).

**Preselected and Postselected Ensemble:**
- Defining a new type of ensemble with no classical analog, having preselected and postselected conditions.

**Probability Calculation:**
- Probability calculation involves propagation of both history and destiny states from initial to final time.

**Time Symmetry:**
- Two-vector formalism reintroduces time symmetry into the theory of measurement in quantum mechanics.

**Resolution of Paradoxes:**
- Addresses nonlocality, delayed choice paradox, and Lorentz covariance violation issues in quantum physics.

**Weak Measurements:**
- Two-vector formalism provides evidence for existence of two boundary conditions during intermediate time through weak measurements.

#### Quantum Consciousness and Collapse of Wave Function

**The Weak Value of a Quantum Observable**

**Properties of the Weak Value**:
- Not bounded by the same spectrum as A (Ali, W., et al.)
- Incompatible operators are simultaneously measurable
- Can be observed for a single quantum system
- Reproducible and satisfy EPR reality condition and counterfactual implications
- Observed in numerous physics experiments

**The Two-Vector Formalism**:
- Generalizes expectation value to weak value of an observable
- Defines "weak measurement" as observation on a preselected ensemble (Tollaksen)
- Suggests role of consciousness in creating destiny states and collapsing the wave function

**Possible Directions for Understanding the Collapse**:
- Irreversible recording in a macroscopic measuring device (Clues 4)
- Higher degree of complexity, such as a closed system with sufficient degrees of freedom that can observe itself

**Experimental Evidence of Negative Kinetic Energy Measurements**:
- Kinetic energy measurements outside the well yield negative values centered around the classical value
- Standard quantum theory interprets this as an error in the measuring device
- Suggests something more than a random collection of errors

**The Temporal Anomaly and Backwards Causality**:
- If the first kinetic energy measurement yields a negative value, the second one often yields a positive value
- Seen as an "error" when measuring position outside the well, but interpreted as a property of the particle if measured later
- Suggests a kind of backwards causality from an individual perspective, though no violation of ensemble causality

**The Two-Vector Theory and Consciousness**:
- Objective consciousness is associated with selecting or creating destiny states
- An awareness variable I > is defined to characterize the relevant state of consciousness
- Transition from quantum to "classical" occurs at the point of awareness, where I > can only be in a definite state
- Suggests that the rate of ticking of consciousness is directly related to the creation of destiny states, forming a new model for space-time.

#### Dynamics of Consciousness in Quantum Theory Processing Difficulties

**Model of Time as Created by Consciousness:**
- New time suggested corresponds to dynamic psychological time experienced in conscious experience
- Resolves issues discussed regarding Schrdinger time and mathematical equations governing quantum systems evolution
- Consciousness finds out the destiny state already there, which depends on what is searched for in the future

**Distinction between Nature's Selection and Conscious Intervention:**
- Nature performs selection of actual value of a quantum observable
- Consciousness provides the destiny state so that system "knows" at what time it has to have a destiny (no dualistic model proposed)
- Collapse parametrized by complexity, like a phase transition

**Understanding of Becoming and Consciousness:**
- Integrative process in collapse creates unity of consciousness
- Expansion of Hilbert space with each new destiny state gives understanding of "Becoming" and inner world of experience

**Experiment to Test Suggested Model:**
- Measure spin state using device that interacts differently depending on spin outcome
- Selection of actual value performed by nature, consciousness provides destiny state
- Distinction between collapses at measuring devices level or consciousness level
- Recent work on quantum parallelism in computing supports unique advantages for solving problems faster than classical computers

**Processing Difficulties in Brain:**
- Spatial and temporal changes in an object under observation present processing difficulties due to different transduction times for various sensory modalities.

---

#### Quantum Integration Theory and Consciousness

**Poppel's Proposed Solution: Temporal Quantization and Elementary Integration Units (EIU)**
- Poppel proposes **temporal "quantization" into zones of simultaneity**, or **Elementary Integration Units (EIU)**: within any given zone, there is no **before -after relation defined between registered events**. Experiments indicate a duration of 30 msec for each zone.
- Poppel analyzes the process involved in consciousness from four functional perspectives: perception, mnemonic representation, stimulus evaluation (emotion), and stimulus response (volition). Each process involves largely different time constants and are significantly distributed throughout the brain.
- Any given content of consciousness is characterized by these different functional domains, so the brain must be able to bind these distributed processes together into a single unified experience. Within any given EIU:
  - **In a sequence of cognitive experiments on awake patients undergoing cortical surgery**, Benjamin Libet discovered a substantial neural delay between the actual sensory signal and the experience.
  - Libet also discovered a subjective referral backwards in time to the time of the original signal.
- In studying voluntary acts, Libet discovered the will to act occurred **350 msec after the initial cerebral processing for the action**, thus contradicting the notion that the will to act is initiated consciously.
- It's hard to understand how consciousness could have any dynamical control without some kind of temporal nonlocality. A new interpretation of quantum mechanics is discussed. This formalism gives a consistent Lorentz covariant mechanism for the collapse of the wave function and a new understanding of quantum phenomenon.
- A new understanding of time is discussed, which resolves a conflict between special relativity and the transient now and also gives us a new model for "Becoming."

**Libet's Work: Conclusions**
- **New from Quantum Theory**: Information is collected from various parts of the brain, an exact Temporal Causal Acquisition (TCA) is not needed due to the structure of the EIU.
- Integration across time has a range of up to 3 seconds and must have top-down qualities: the representation partly determines the method of representation. The type of seamless temporal integration required between EIUs does not seem possible with classical neural algorithms, so Poppel suggests:
  - This time- and structure-creating process and the observed non-localized interactions occurring in the network of neurons lead us to the supposition that the functioning of the brain cannot be understood using classical concepts and that abstract brain theory has to be based on abstract quantum theory.
  - A model of this process using the two-vector theory is suggested: each boundary of an EIU is the creation of one destiny state. In between the planes, all registered events are linked together via multiple time states. The multiple-time state actualizes correlations between quantum observables at different times, although the observable itself is undetermined for any given time. This actualization across time creates the necessary seamless integration.
  - The selection of a destiny state creates the EIU and is therefore responsible for psychological time. By unity of consciousness we mean that the essence of a conscious event is lost when we attempt to break it down into a simple aggregate of localized components as classical physics requires.
- Poppel thanks various researchers and the Fetzer Institute for their support of this project.

### 40 Consciousness A New Computational Paradigm

**Computation and the Study of Consciousness**

**Computation in the Sciences**:
- Nonphysical minds should be studied like other physical theories
- The brain is seen as a "fantastic computer" or as having a "mysterious nonphysical property" called the "mind"

**Dualism vs. Materialism**:
- Dualists believe in two distinct types of substances: mental and physical
- Materialists argue that the brain and mind are one and the same, based on neurological research

**Limitations of Computational Approaches**:
- Purely mechanistic computational approaches do not provide insight into the mystery of consciousness
- A correct computational model for intelligence must precede any theory of consciousness

**A Rationale for a Dualist Model of the Mind**:
- The author's assumption is that a good computational model for intelligence must support a theory of consciousness
- Research in physics has shown how indirect measurements can be used to study nonphysical phenomena

**Challenges for Computational Approaches**:
- Computing is a physical action, so it is subject to physical limits
- Other limitations include the number of dimensions and the uncertainty principle

**The "Newtonian Bottleneck" in Computer Architecture**:
- The traditional von Neumann computer architecture separates memory and processing, which violates modern physics' view of a unified space-time
- Cellular architectures that integrate memory and logic are more aligned with modern physics

**Challenges to Building Truly Intelligent Machines**:
- Hard computational problems like dynamic motion control, cryptography, and planning exceed the capabilities of conventional computers
- A "revolutionary computational approach" is needed to build truly intelligent machines, as these problems are all members of the same formal class of algorithms

**Physics Research on Quantum Computing**:
- Scientists are studying quantum computing as a mechanism for exponential speedup and potential applications to consciousness
- Quantum physics' unusual properties of nonlocal correlations may be relevant to understanding consciousness

---

#### Unifying Observation Frameworks for Consciousness Modeling

**Physics Approach to Understanding Intelligence and Consciousness**
- Relativity comprehends unusual properties of variable space and time
- Physics must develop a solution for human "real intelligence" as it represents an evolutionary complexity-increasing informational process
- Cosmologists studying universe's evolution combine techniques from information, quantum, and relativity theories
  - These fields may provide insights into extraordinary computational facilities and consciousness
- Research on higher dimensional semantics in nature and computers can be computationally advantageous
- Simulating high-dimensional problem semantants on one-dimensional virtual memory systems is inefficient
- Combining information, quantum, gravity theories (e.g., "It from Bit" paper by Wheeler) to understand mind
  - Grand Theories combining all known theories have names like Bit string Physics, Quantum Gravity, Theory of Everything
- Topological consistency and higher dimensional space-times are common themes in these physical sciences

**Consistency Frameworks and Observational Models**
- Consistency frameworks form the foundation for multiple observational viewpoints or "Points of View"
- Observer's interaction with what is being observed is part of understanding observation process
- Four independent frameworks for observation: (1) information/sampling theory, (2) relativity inertial frames, (3) quantum wave function collapse, and (4) self-referential aspect of mind called CONSISTENCY
- Consistency is more primitive than conservation laws of energy/mass or space and time
- Consistency requires light to follow locally "straight line" geodesics in curved space-time
- Consistency results in constant c and variable space and time (Lorentz transformation)
- Inertial frames are completely relative and outside physics, they cannot be acted upon.

**Unified Framework for Consistent Observation**
- Combine observational frameworks into a single unified one that describes consistent observation
- The consistency arguments used to develop relativity theory should apply to all observational frameworks
- These consistency arguments define the nature of space and time, primary resources for computation.

---

#### Relativity and Computational Leverage Mechanisms

**Einstein's Relativity Principle**
- Main idea: All inertial frames are totally equivalent for physical experiments
- Laws of physics apply consistently across all frames, regardless of location or speed

**Consequences of Relativity**
1. **Position Invariance**: Any point in space is as good as any other
2. **Rotation Invariance/Isotropy**: Any direction is as good as any other
3. **Velocity Invariance**: Except for the speed of light, c
4. **Inertial Frames**: Mathematical frameworks for relating various viewpoints
5. **Conserved Properties**: Not all primitives are truly invariant (e.g., mass and energy)
6. **Parametrized Consistency Metrics**: Only true cornerstone for observation
7. **Speed of Light**: Constant regardless of measurement or speed
8. **Gravity**: Nothing more than an acceleration due to matter bending space and time
9. **Relativity's Framework**: Intuitive and advanced theory with implications for the mind and consciousness research
10. **Computational Leverage Ideas**
   - Use ballistic computation and geodesics to reduce power costs
   - Manipulate locality to shorten perceived distances
   - Consistency mechanisms behave as superluminal synchronization primitives
   - Act upon inertial frames or consider higher order Lorentz contraction
   - Quantum computers can provide exponential speedup
   - Consistency mechanisms interact outside normal linear time
   - Increased dimensionality increases degrees of freedom
   - Prespatial and pretemporal change mechanisms may be hierarchical and sparse

**Observational Framework for Consciousness**
- Relativity and quantum mechanics impact all physical laws, including observational frameworks
- Mind as the ultimate observational mechanism requires an abstract computational model
- Carver Mead's two costs of computation: **Spatial Entropy** (information in the wrong place) and **Logical Entropy** (information in the wrong form)
- Expanded spatial entropy theory deals with dimensionality, geometry, locality, and space-time metrics required for an observational framework.

### 41 A Mathematical Strategy for a Theory of Consciousness

**Ancient Idea: Hyperdimensional Reality**
- Reality is a subrealm of a larger hyperdimensional reality
- Plato's "cave story" metaphor suggests that three-dimensional bodies are shadows of higher dimensions
- Unified field theory in physics explores this concept further, aiming for a "theory of everything"

**Mathematical Unification and Consciousness**
- Mathematical unification of physical forces (electromagnetism, nuclear, gravity) hints at consciousness theory
- Recent mathematical techniques used in superstring theory may reveal new insights on mass and consciousness

**Three Facts Regarding Quantum Theory and Reflection Spaces**
1. Observable: only eigenvalues of measurement operators are observed
2. Unified Field Theory: fundamental eigenvalues form vertices of hyperdimensional crystallographic structures in reflection spaces
3. Measurement Problem: unresolved question about the process by which eigenvalues emerge in observation

**Research Strategy: Study Mathematics of Reflection Spaces for Insights on Consciousness**
- Coxeter graphs (1934) classify all possible reflection spaces, corresponding to different types of hyperdimensional structures
- Dynkin diagrams (1947) also classify Lie algebras, which relate to the mathematical structure of reflection spaces
- Catastrophe theory (1960s) describes rapid changes in dynamic systems and has potential applications to understanding consciousness.

---

#### Mathematical Models of Consciousness and Quantum Gravity Correspondences

**D. Broad and J. R. Smythies (Smythies 1969)**
- Russian mathematician V. I. Arnold used A-DE graphs to classify simple catastrophes in 1968
- This infinite set of catastrophes includes Thom's elementary catastrophes as a subset

**Reflection Spaces and Catastrophes (Arnold 1981, Sirag 1993)**
- Reflection space is derived from a control space by allowing all possible reflections to occur
- The A3 reflection space projects down to create a new reflection "orbit" space
- Arnold used A-DE graphs to classify more than twenty types of mathematical objects related to reflection spaces and catastrophes

**Relationship between Reflection Spaces and Catastrophes**
- Intimate relationship between reflection space and catastrophe control space
- Allows for the study of all simple objects simultaneously through their A-DE classifications

**Other Useful Mathematical Objects Classified by A-DE Graphs**
1. Reflection spaces, reflection = Coxeter = Weyl groups (Coxeter 1973)
2. Lie algebras and Lie groups (Dynkin 1962)
3. Gauge theories of particle physics (Sirag 1993)
4. Error-correcting code (root) lattices (Conway and Sloane 1988)
5. Quantizing (weight) lattices; analog-to-digital conversion (Conway and Sloane 1988)
6. Catastrophes, unfoldings and resolutions of singularities (Arnold 1981)
7. Bifurcations of equilibrium states (Arnold 1981, 1986)
8. Heisenberg algebras (and groups); uncertainty principle (Kostant 1984)
9. Gravitational instantons; twistor structures (Kronheimer 1989, 1990)
10. Wave front evolutions; optical caustics (Arnold 1981, 1986)
11. Generalized braid groups; knots and links (Kaufman 1991)
12. Platonic solids and other regular figures left invariant by finite subgroups (McKay 1980, Ihodowy 1981)

**Connection to Unified Field Theory and Consciousness (Penrose 1989, Sirag 1982, 1989, 1993)**
- E7 graph favored as descriptor of unified field theory due to its connections with reflection spaces and catastrophes
- A-DE correspondences can be used for clarifying relationships between twistors and superstrings in superstring theory (Witten 1988)
- Studying the relationship between eigenvalues, gravity, and consciousness may lead to a unified field theory that entails gravity, which could have relevance for a theory of consciousness.

#### Exploring Quantum Consciousness through E7 Graph Theory and Gravity Gauge Fields

**Identity Fiber and Singularity**
* Identity fiber: C2/0D, set of OD orbits on C2 (where OD is the 48-element octahedral double group)
* Singularity: has a "kink" that can be unfolded by perturbations specified by choosing points in C7/W
* C7/W: derived from allowing all reflections on all points of C7 to occur, resulting in reflection hyperplanes transforming into the discriminant surface

**Deformations of Fibers and Description Methods**
* Recent aid for description is Gravitational Instanton Theory
* Four-dimensional space-time with a single "end" at infinity, looking like C2/g (where g is some McKay group) in the E7 case: C2/0D
* Fields on this space-time correspond to the structure of the 00 group algebra C[OO]
* Proposed unified gauge theory for all forces using unitary elements in C[OO]: U(2)xT6 (electromagnetism, weak force, strong force, hyperweak force, gravity gauge force)

**Fundamental Processes of Consciousness**
* Eigenvalues are primitive observables that correspond to fundamental qualia or sensations
* Reflection group W acts on the E7 reflection space, changing one vertex into another: basic quantum jumps
* Each reflection is accompanied by a "blip" of awareness
* Coherent experience in nervous system is similar to detailed model developed by James Culbertson

**Relationships between Structures and Consciousness**
* Unitary elements in C[OO] account for all the unitary elements
* Seven-dimensional reflection space, 17/W (related to E7 graph) has a similar structure as its base space, C7/W
* Closely related to eigenvalues and measurement operators for E7 graph
* Macroscopic quantum system in body of experiencer may provide coherence of consciousness experience

**Additional Relationships and Implications**
* Hamming-7 code generated by E7 graph suggests cognitive aspect of consciousness related to coding theory, invariant theory, and analog-to-digital transforms
* Embedding of lower dimensional structures in higher ones implies a hierarchical spectrum of reality structures: E6, ordinary reality, and E8 realms
* Three E realms are the only doorways to the "nonsimple" structure beyond A-DE hierarchy.

### 42 Nonlocality on a Human Scale Psi and Consciousness Research

**Psychic Phenomena and Consciousness Research**

**Basic Limiting Principles**:
- Person cannot perceive physical events/things without sensory input
- Event cannot have effects before it happens
- Mind's effects on the material world are limited to changes in one's own brain

**Psi Phenomena and Common Sense**:
- Belief in psychic phenomena (clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition, psychokinesis) violates these principles
- Challenges predominant assumptions about consciousness and physical reality

**Research Approaches**:
- **"Elitist" approach**: Seeks clear demonstrations of psi in gifted subjects
- **"Universalist" approach**: Defines protocols to detect weak psi signals across populations
- Goal: Determine predictors of positive psi performance and develop more repeatable procedures

**Meta-Analysis in Parapsychology**:
- Summarizes experimental results across studies
- Codes study characteristics, cumulates results, and evaluates robustness of database
- Identifies common moderator variables and assesses homogeneity of findings
- Reduces subjectivity by coding methodological weaknesses

**Psi Research Directions**:
- Extended Person-Person Exchanges: Ganzfeld studies on telepathy
- Person-Animal Exchanges: Uncertain relevance to consciousness research
- Person-Matter Exchanges: Also uncertain relevance, but some experiments show consistent results

---

#### Metaanalysis of Psychic Phenomena Experiments

**Metaanalysis of Ganzfeld Studies:**
- Rosenthal (1986) conducted a metaanalysis of 28 ganzfeld studies, involving 835 sessions and 589 subjects
- Mean hit rate was 38% compared to expected 25%, corresponding to an overall effect size of 0.28
- Results held up with the introduction of rigorous controls in later research by Honorton et al. (1990)
- Metaanalysis yielded a significant composite z-score, indicating strong evidence for psi phenomena

**BioPK Studies:**
- Over 150 studies have explored bioPK or psychic healing since mid-1960s
- Various biological targets: animals, cells, humans
- Significant results in 57% of experiments; metaanalysis yields a strong combined effect size of 0.33

**Precognition Research:**
- Honorton and Ferrari (1989) metaanalyzed precognition studies between 1935-1987
- Total of 62 investigators, 50,000 subjects, nearly 2 million trials
- About a third significant at 0.05 level; effect sizes remained constant but study quality improved
- Stronger results for short time intervals suggest accuracy may decline with time

**Moderator Variables in Psi Research:**
- Schechter's metaanalysis of hypnosis and ESP studies showed significant improvement in ESP performance under hypnosis condition (P=0.000034)
- Honorton et al.'s research found a positive correlation between extraversion and free response ESP scores (z = 4.82, P = 0.(x)(xx )15)
- Lawrence's metaanalysis confirmed the sheep-goat effect with believers scoring higher than nonbelievers in ESP experiments (z = 8.17, P = 1.33 X 10-16).

---

#### Psi Research and the Reality of Consciousness

**Metaanalysis Findings on ESP Scores and Defense Mechanisms**
- Watt's (1991) metaanalysis of 13 studies found consistently superior ESP scores in low-defensive subjects compared to high-defensive ones (z = 4.55, P < 0.001).
- This is consistent with findings using other openness/defensiveness measures.

**Summary and Conclusion**
- Metaanalyses show that psi can be demonstrated in person-person and person-organism interactions with high replicability rates and moderate effect sizes.
- Evidence for psi is widespread, implicating broad subject populations and a large number of independent laboratories.
- Positive results cannot be attributed to selective reporting, faulty statistics, or suspect subjects; study quality ratings and outcomes are not related.
- Data show conceptual cohesiveness and plausible relationships with state and trait factors.
- Recent interdisciplinary studies illustrate the promise of investigating psi in bioPK research and mental/physiological states that facilitate or block psi.
- Psi research challenges reductionist and epiphenomenalist frameworks, suggesting consciousness is an active source of nonlocal entropy reduction.
- Epistemological issues arise as researchers may shape experimental findings through subtle expectancy effects, making objective data less trustworthy.

### 43 Synchronicity and Emergent Nonlocal Information in Quantum Systems

**Introduction:**
- C.G. Jung's belief in advances in psychology through physics, particularly quantum physics
- Emphasis on Wolfgang Pauli's ideas connecting synchronicity and quantum mechanics
- Overview of the paper's aims: rehabilitate Pauli's ideas; consider synchronicity experimentally

**Synchronicity (C.G. Jung):**
- Definition: psychic event with a physical manifestation, not explicable by physical causality
- Two independent causal chains connected through emergence of meaning
- Psyche and matter show significant correlation, suggesting an intrinsic wholeness
- Archetype activation in the collective unconscious leads to synchronistic events

**Pauli and Synchronicity:**
- Intense exchange of ideas between Pauli and C.G. Jung on physics and psychology
- Connection made between lung's world of archetypes - synchronicity - and quantum physics
- Pauli focused on the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, where observer seems involved in results
- Pauli established deeper connection between observer and observed quantum system

**Implications:**
- Further exploration of synchronicity and its implications for consciousness and nonlocal information in the human brain.
- Suggested experimental approach to be discussed.

---

#### Quantum Physics and Consciousness Synchronicity in Observation

**Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness**

**Intrinsic Unity in Quantum/Unconscious Level**
- Progressive divergence and appearance as separate domains of reality
- Example: Choice of experiment setup influences quantum results
- Observer's influence a consequence of conscious choice (Wheeler, Wigner)

**Collapse of the Wave Function**
- Schrdinger equation only provides theoretical description
- Probabilistic predictions about final issue
- Cat in box example: infinite possibilities until observation

**Role of Conscious Observer**
- Final state and collapse of wave function revealed through conscious observation
- Pauli suggested connection to unconscious attitude of observer

**Synchronicity and Emergent Nonlocal Information**
- Synchronistic occurrences may emerge in individual quantum events (statistical causality)
- Complementary relationship between ego-conscious and unconscious (Jung's analytical psychology)
- Figure 43.4: Reality scheme according to Pauli.

**Quantum Physics and Consciousness**
- Statistical causality, taking a middle way between causality and synchronicity
- Depth of individual quantum events emphasized by Pauli (unique and irrational)

---

#### Quantum Synchronicity and Archetypes in Paulis Interpretation

**Pauli's Perspective on Quantum Physics and Reality**
- **Quantum physics**: Represented in the center of Pauli's scheme, encompassing both aspects of reality.
- **Synchronicity**: Refers to the connection between physical events and psychological factors.
- **Unconscious (anima mundi)**: Can manifest itself in quantum systems as individual, random events not included in statistical considerations.
- **Collapse of wave function**: May occur spontaneously, correlated with the observer's unconscious psychic attitude.
- **Individual quantum events**: Endowed with meaning and can be a form of continuous creation.

**Pauli's Suggestions for Bridging Psyche and Matter**
- **Archetypes**: Widen Jungian concept to include factors that span psyche and matter, as well as the assumption that natural numbers are archetypes of order and dynamic aspects of the unconscious psyche.
- **Numbers**: Ultimate foundations and primitive form of archetype; connection between two worlds.

**Application in Physical Sciences**
- Unconscious factors or "new concepts, which are uniformly simultaneously physical and psychological" can force themselves through the gap of individual events in quantum systems.

**Synchronistic Events**
- In most cases, irrational (individual) quantum events are considered as mere chance occurrences.
- Psychosomatic diseases illustrate how the collapse of the wave function may occur without conscious knowledge and lead to unwanted manifestations.

**Role of Consciousness in Creation**
- Wheeler and Wigner view ego consciousness as an indispensable factor; Pauli's hypothesis allows for a possible synchronistic event without conscious contribution.
- Meaning of synchronistic events may not be instantly realized by the observer, but the collapse of the wave function occurs nevertheless.

**Manifestation of Archetypes in Space and Time**
- Archetypes manifest themselves in space and time through ordered sequences of events (natural numbers).

---

#### Quantum and Archetypal Attractors in Synchronicity

**Archetypes and Numbers**

**Archetypes as Qualitative Fields**:
- Archetypes are active fields of rhythmically unfolding psychic and physical sequences
- Pauli, as an intuitive scientist, adopted Jung's ideas about archetypes
- Believed in the "identity (homousia) between the archetypal world (mundus archetypus) and matter (physis)"

**Archetypes as Transcendent Concepts**:
- Expressed through neutral mathematical concepts like number
- Archetype of Number allows the application of mathematics to physics
- Archetypes have a connection with psyche, as seen in concepts like Trinity, Quaternity, and Mantic procedures

**Archetypes and Attractors**:
- Archetypes are similar to mathematical attractors
- Defined by Jung as "the possibility of the course of energetic processes"
- Determine dynamic sequences in both psychic and physical world
- Can be used to describe the behavior of individuals, like limit cycle attractors

**Similarities Between Psyche and Quantum World**:
- Synchronistic events suggest an underlying identity between psyche and matter
- Quantum systems have more points in common with the world of psyche (and archetypes) than initially thought

**Implications**:
- Pauli's ideas allow a more pragmatic approach to Jung's theory of synchronicity

---

#### Quantum Neurodynamics and Synchronicity in Psychology and Physics

**Synchronicity Theory Applications in Sciences:**
* Implications for physical and biological sciences
* Nonlocal information processing in human brain suggested by synchronicity theory
* Similarities between psyche and quantum world: causality, complementarity, simultaneity/nonlocality
* Pauli's ideas on synchronicity: undifferentiated domain of matter and psyche, archetypes as source of experiences
* New approach to nonlocal phenomena: consider cytoskeleton of neural cells as a dynamical system for emergent quantum information
* Proposed unification of quantum physics and psychology through synchronicity theory.

**Experimental Set-up:**
- Detection of synchronistic event in two separate quantum systems using recording device
- Increased number of correlations between systems when archetype constellated in psychic system of observer
- Coherent response of all associated neurons and creation of next best visual association in brain

**Implications for Modern Science:**
- Consciousness as a nonlocal phenomenon, human brain as focusing substrate for its emergence
- Contemporary science's attempts to explain consciousness on mechanical and causalistic basis
- Necessity of uniting quantum physics and psychology through synchronicity theory.

## IX Hierarchical Organization

**Hierarchical Organization in Brain Modeling**

**Donald Hebb and The Organization of Behavior (1949)**
- Seminal work bridging psychology and neurology
- Introduced concept of cell assembly

**Cell Assembly**
- Diffuse structure comprising neurons
- Capable of acting as closed system, delivering facilitation to other systems
- Often associated with specific motor facilitation
- Part of a phase sequence - thought process
- Aroused by preceding assembly or sensory event

**Characteristics of Cell Assembly**
1. Threshold for excitation: Requires certain level of activation to be triggered
2. All-or-nothing response: Once activated, undergoes complete response
3. Hierarchical in nature: Higher-order assemblies comprise multiple subassemblies

**Chapter Overview (This Section)**
- Focus on hierarchical structure of brain and potential emergence of mind from hierarchy
- Erich Harth's Theory presented in Chapter 44, The Creative Loop

**Erich Harth's Theory: The Creative Loop**
1. Self-referential system with top down control
   - Modifies activities at sensory areas
2. Positive feedback throughout hierarchy
   - Dynamic unity tailored to specific perceptual event
3. Demonstrated ability through computer algorithm realization
   - Teases recognizable image of Albert Einstein from noisy background

### 44 Self-Referent Mechanisms as the Neuronal Basis of Consciousness

**Self-Referent Mechanisms as the Neuronal Basis of Consciousness**

**London Pub's Stout Reputation**:
- Resulted from positive feedback process of "bootstrap" effect
- Stout is always fresh due to pub being crowded
- Pub is always crowded because stout is always fresh
- This led to the owner's unexpected prosperity

**Unifying Theme in Approaches to Consciousness**:
- Reconciling the diversity of cortical processors with apparent perceptual and individual unity, the "binding problem"
- Variety of approaches sought answers at different physical scales, from nanometer to macroscopic phenomena

**The Importance of Mutual Interactions in Life**:
- Phenomena at all scales are coupled through mutual interactions, allowing bottom-up and top-down controls
- Microstructures organized by macroscopic experience, microscopic fluctuations propagated upward

**Dualist Approach to Consciousness**:
- Early idea of a "sensus communis" or common sensorium where sensory data converged
- Classical dualist approach had an immaterial "homunculus" gathering and coordinating the diverse cortical analyzers
- Difficulty in reconciling this with physical processes in the brain

**Theories Seeking a Physical Basis for Consciousness**:
- Avoided dualism, but still required identifying specific neural activity patterns or subsets of neurons with mental states
- Problem: These require an external observer to detect coordination, which is "unpalatable" in a physicalist framework

**The "Locality Problem"**:
- Neurons transmit simple signals to other cells
- Interactions between neurons are local, and consciousness cannot reside within the neurons themselves

**Proposed Solution: Self-Referent System**
- Presenting the conscious brain as a single, integrated, self-referent system
- Avoids reliance on semantic final or output states

#### Neural Network Dynamics and Consciousness

**Neural Dynamics and Consciousness**

**Characteristics of Neural Networks:**
- Consists of billions of neurons connected to each other
- Connectivity determines network characteristics, including firing patterns
- Firing produces excitatory or inhibitory effects on connected neurons
- Limited information obtained through experimental methods (microelectrode recordings and gross methods)
- Theoretical studies based on deterministic assumptions

**Established Facts:**
1. Sensory pathways connect receptors to neural centers, each containing multiple neurons
2. Neural centers are reciprocally connected and multiply connected
3. Neural net is a massively parallel processor with simultaneous processing in various channels
4. No single center for all analyzed sensory messages
5. Sensory stimuli cause widespread neural activity suggesting significant brain states in populations, not individual neurons

**Complexity of the Brain:**
- Defined as a system with billions of subunits forming hierarchical structures and hyperstructures
- Dynamics extend over various scales from microscopic to macroscopic
- Lively communication between different levels (bottom-up and top-down control)

**Consciousness and Localization Problem:**
- Complexity of the brain makes attributing meaning or consciousness to a neural population challenging due to the locality problem
- External observers can observe collective states of activity in specialized groups, but internal observation requires knowledge-at-a-distance or an internal neurophysiologist.

---

#### Reciprocal Connections and Feedback Loops in Sensory Pathways

**Complex Systems and Consciousness:** The Role of Neurophysiology

**The Homunculus Problem**:
- Complex systems, like the brain, have subtle changes at microscopic levels affecting macroscopic behavior
- Information flows up and down physical scales with ease in complex systems
- Minute events (noise) can materially affect macroscopic events

**Sensory Pathways as Neuronal Basis of Consciousness:**

**The Slaughterhouse Paradigm**:
- Useful features extracted from sensory input by analyzers in sequential and parallel chains
- No center reassembles entire picture, but consciousness not located at hippocampus

**Reciprocal Connections between Centers**:
- Most connections between centers are reciprocal
- Feedback loops modify sensory information through return pathways
- Problem of the inverse: Requires inverting feature extraction properties for targeted modifications

**Mental Imagery**:
- Longstanding controversy on neural basis
- Iconic representation of images at peripheral visual centers vs. triggering circuits in higher cerebral centers
- Cortical depth of mental image depends on desired retinotopic detail or spatial relationship.

---

#### Neural Mechanisms and Mental Imagery A Discussion on Consciousness

**Abstract Thoughts on Mental Images**

**Hexagon Concept:**
- Can be thought abstractly as a regular or irregular polygon
- Images may be formed using words or nonverbal geometrical concepts
- Different neural activities involved depending on nature and location of the image

**Experiments on Mental Images:**
- Some suggest images possess picture-like properties, examinable by "inner eye"
- Recent experiments using positron emission tomography (pET) show neural activity in retinotopically organized visual brain centers during visual imagery

**Quasi-Sensory Patterns:**
- Proposed solution to problem of inverse: high-level feature analyzers generate scalar function for optimization algorithm to modify sensory input patterns and create images without inputs
- Two fundamental questions remain: how are quasisensory patterns created, and how do peripheral images lead to conscious perception?

**Binding Problem:**
- Objects perceived as single entities despite being analyzed in different brain parts
- Subjective sensation of unique and indivisible "I"
- Theories of consciousness differ on the nature of binding: dualism, multiple minds theory, reconciliation theories

**Crick and Koch Theory:**
- Binding achieved through temporal correlation of activities of neurons involved in sensory analysis
- Consciousness deduces meaning from simultaneous firing of specific neurons but leaves unsolved problem of locality.

---

#### Neuronal Basis of Consciousness Self-Referential Feedback Loops

**Dennett's Argument Flaws**
- Dennett asserts a fundamental principle of physics is that any change in trajectory requires energy expenditure, but this is incorrect:
  - Not every change in trajectory is an acceleration
  - Acceleration does not always require energy expenditure
- Dennett associates his argument with ectoplasm and supernatural phenomena like Victorian seances and ghosts

**Societal Dynamics Analogy**
- Physical interactions between individuals and their environment do not explain societal dynamics fully
- Nonphysical elements, such as love, hate, prejudice, politics, and philosophies, guide societies
- Laws, though intangible, affect physical conduct (e.g., prevent alcohol sales on Sundays)
- Attempting to describe societal dynamics only in physical terms is nonsensical

**Complexity of Human Affairs**
- Individuals' thoughts force us to seek new descriptors and relationships at higher levels of complexity
- Descriptors used at lower levels may be useless or meaningless at higher levels, but still valid
- A science of the mind must connect with phenomenology at lower levels while dealing with concepts not encountered there

**Theories of Consciousness**
- Theories equating subjective perception with an output state are inadequate due to the question of who observes that state
- To avoid this, we need to assume "smart" neurons or abandon locality principles

**Neural Network Architecture and Self-Referential Feedback Loops**
- Neural network contains multiple causal loops, with centers along sensory pathways under both bottom-up and top-down control
- This causes sensory information flow to be self-referent

---

#### Neural Optimization and Consciousness Alopex Algorithm and Visual Perception

**Mental Imagery and Consciousness Model**

**Experiments**:
- Visual mental images are accompanied by neural activity in peripheral visual centers of the cortex (Kosslyn et al., 1993)
- Activities reflect metric qualities of objects imagined, indicating feature-specific feedback

**Assumptions**:
- Self-reference: Cyclic process with top-down control, modifying peripheral images viewed by higher centers via ascending sensory pathways
- Inverse problem: Feedback paths for template matching or feature-specific top-down control using hill-climbing mechanisms
- Cost function derived at higher levels of sensory processing to modify image quality through optimization (hill-climbing)
- Selection: Cost function can select specific input features, excluding others based on cortical associations and chance events
- Modification: Enhance particular features and suppress others in the absence of sensory input; generate quasi-sensory images

**Imagery**:
- Peripheral visual centers function as "internal sketchpads" for mental imagery initiated by fluctuations in prefrontal cortex (working memory)
- Imagery takes place at various cortical levels depending on image abstractness

**Hill-Climbing Algorithm Optimization**:
- Hill-climbing algorithms adjust a multitude of control parameters to optimize a scalar cost function, which is a measure of system functioning
- Alopex: Simple optimization algorithm used for visual receptive field plotting in frog visual tectum (Tzanakou et al., 1979)
- Proposed for feature-specific feedback during visual perception by maximizing the pattern of neural activity at lower levels based on central feature analyzer responses

**Implementation**:
- Requires very primitive neural circuitry, such as the geniculo-cortical loop (Figure 44.2)
- Inverse process cannot be achieved by simple template matching; requires complex neural circuitry to reconstruct visual scenes from high-level neural codes

**Simulations**:
- Tested idea of pattern modification and generation using optimization algorithms in a series of computer simulations (Harth et al., 1987, 1990)

---

#### Optimization Algorithm for Pattern Recognition

**Experiment Details:**
- **P**: 30x30 array with 900 control variables (xi ... XN)
- **Analyzers A**: templates constructed from photographs of 4 people, including Einstein
- **Cost Function F**: determined by analyzer responses R1, ... R4; optimized through Alopex algorithm

**Process Dynamics:**
1. Completion: partial or noisy input patterns are completed with appropriate features and suppressed to increase response in corresponding analyzer
2. Selection: when sensory input is pure noise, a central analyzer takes control and generates corresponding image
3. Chaining: sequence of events established through associative strengthening of connections between groups of analyzer neurons tend to generate the remaining sequence

**Arguments for Model:**
- Slow process times align with cognitive processes
- Use of hierarchy of feature analyzers can shorten convergence times
- Subjective recognition may only require slight increase in cost function rather than complete convergence
- Other optimization algorithms or template matching may be used

**Discussion and Summary:**
- Consciousness sought in privileged output neurons at highest cortical levels (final state theories)
- Present model accounts for ubiquitous feedback pathways, does not require interpreter or homunculus
- Peripheral sensory centers, central analyzers, and working memory form reentrant loops and operate self-referentially
- Binding of neural messages occurs through top-down control of sensory images via optimization algorithms.

---

#### Optimization Algorithms and Sensory Perception in Consciousness

**Neural Network Model for Consciousness**

**Assumptions:**
- Cost function extracted from neural activities in working memory
- Expresses compatibility between sensory messages or conformance with expectation
- Same cost function used in optimization algorithms across levels and modalities

**Conscious Perception:**
1. Near-chaotic parallel processes in working memory not conscious without selection by peripheral sensory centers
2. Sensory images meaningless without higher cortical center interactions
3. Self-referent interactions between central and peripheral regions provide consciousness
4. Positive feedback can lead to hallucinations, but realities compete in ordinary perception
5. Complexity of human brain prevents detailed analyses with lower hierarchic structures
6. Consciousness a useful descriptor for dealing with human thought dynamics

**Optimization Algorithm: Alopex**
1. Adjust control variables to maximize or minimize cost function F
2. Iterations adjust xi(N) based on previous variable and cost function differences
3. Noise term gi added for simplicity, absolute magnitude same as noise
4. Positive product of brackets indicates increase in control variables and cost function
5. Attractive due to simplicity and ease of implementing neural circuits
6. Applicable to various optimization problems
7. Attention given to vision sense unless stated otherwise.

### 45 A Framework of Higher-Order Cognition and Consciousness

**Emergence: Framework for Higher-Order Cognition and Consciousness**

**Introduction:**
- Emergence in consciousness theory: Sperry's perspective, recent arguments by Hameroff & Scott
- Complexity of the brain as a hierarchical structure
- Need for a formal framework to discuss emergence, complex structures, and hierarchies

**Hyperstructure Concept:**
1. Unifying concept for higher-order structures or objects
2. Defines what should be called a "higher-order structure" or "object" (Figure 45.1)
3. Consists of: Primitives (first-order structures), second-order structures, and families {Sf2}, i  J
4. Observational mechanism is crucial for evaluating, observing, and describing the structures
5. Can be based on numerical functions or more sophisticated operators in mathematics

**Construction of a New Structure:**
1. Collection (5) of old structures {Sf1} from some index set J (finite or infinite)
2. Apply observational mechanisms (Obs) to obtain properties 5;, Obs(5)
3. Subject the 5;'s to family of interactions (Int) using registered observations
4. Form a new kind of structure: Second-order structures R(Sf1), Obs2
5. Collection 5 is considered as a unity with unique properties measured by Obs2
6. Emergence: P  Obs2, but not in any Sfi for all it
7. First-order emergence: Whole is more than the sum of its parts
8. Relates to cognition: "emergence of global states in a network of simple components" (Varela et al., 1992)

**Hierarchical Structures:**
1. Occur frequently in biological systems, favored by evolution
2. Passage from one level to the next is what emergence is about
3. Studying multilevel systems requires understanding this concept of emergence.

#### Emergence of Complex Systems through Hyperstructures A Framework for Higher-Order Cognition and Consciousness

**Hyperstructure Principle**
- Definition of a hyperstructure: A framework for studying problems of complex design, embracing tree-type and network-type structures at various levels of emergence and complexity
- Levels of structures: Primitive (first-order) and Second-order structures
- Evolution towards higher-order structures through the observation mechanism (represented by an "observer" or environment)
- Formation of families of second-order structures, resulting in new properties, interactions, and emergence at each level
- Nth order structure: A cumulative structure that may depend on all lower levels
- Complexity and classification of structures based on orders of emergence and complexity

**Hyperstructure vs. Traditional Hierarchies**
- Hyperstructures are more subtle than traditional hierarchies or networks, allowing for both "downward" and "upward" causation
- Overlapping aggregates and deletion of interactions are allowed in a hyperstructure

**Application of Hyperstructures**
- Useful in understanding cognitive processes, complex design problems, evolution, creativity, learning, etc.

**Hyperstructures and Consciousness**
- Cognition as emergence: Recognition or registration of new global states or properties through an observer (sensory system) leading to new interactions and potentially higher-order cognitive processes.
- Reasoning: A combination of using syntactic rules, observations, and interactions in a semantic manner.

#### Consciousness as Hyperstructured Cognition Quantum Hypothesis and Emergent Properties

**Hyperstructures and Consciousness**

**Hyperstructures:**
- Framework for describing cognitive processes
- Organisms seen as examples of hyperstructures
- Life an emergent property at different scales
- Brain is suggested to be a complex system of neurons, consciousness an emergent property
- Areas of special importance for coherent functioning identified: Broca's and Wernicke's areas
- Supported by cell assembly theory and work on visual cortex
- New field of artificial life explores characterization of life-like behavior

**Consciousness:**
- Suggestion that consciousness is a hyperstructured cognitive process
- Unconsciousness may be low order consciousness
- Neurons taken as primitives, quantum effects and nonalgorithmic behavior possible influences
- Penrose's argument: Consciousness needed for new judgments where rules aren't laid down
- Hameroff's theory: Quantum coherence among neural proteins in microtubules might explain consciousness
- Cytoskeleton components like microtubules suggested as bottom level substrate for consciousness emergence.

---

#### Emergence in Complex Systems A Study of Coherent Excitations

**Hypersb\"uctures and Emergence**

**Question 3**:
- Could hypersb\"uctures represent a kind of coherent organization that would facilitate global quantum effects?
- This idea is an extension of the situation in microtubules, where proteins are vibrant and dynamic structures with coherent excitations as cases of emergence.
- In a hypersb\"uctured medium, we may get excitations and vibrations at several levels.
- Under favorable conditions, could a transfer or propagation of local effects to global effects occur via the same mechanisms that cause emergence and tie the hypersb\"ucture together?
- Vibrations in hypersb\"uctured media are interesting and may be closely connected with consciousness.

**Framework for Emergence and Higher-Order Structures**:
- Baas has presented a framework for emergence and higher-order structures, including discussion of higher-order cognition and consciousness.
- The framework distinguishes between two notions of emergence:
  - **Deducible/Computable Emergence**: There is a deductive or computational process that determines whether an emergent property P belongs to the set Obs2.
  - **Observational Emergence**: P is an emergent property, but cannot be deduced like Deducible Emergence.
- Examples of Observational Emergence include:
  1. Topological gluing construction: K(M) may be very complex compared to K(V), indicating the emergence of nontrivial properties.
  2. The Scott-model of the A-calculus: The property of being a solution to the equation D = [D -+ D] emerged through inverse limit construction.

**Other Examples of Emergence**:
1. Gdel's Incompleteness Theorems: True statements cannot be deduced from axioms in formal systems, indicating emergent properties beyond the system.
2. Dynamical Systems: Fractal-like structures like attractors, repellers, and Julia sets emerge as second-order structures in complex dynamic systems.

---

#### Exploring Emergent Phenomena and Hyperstructures in Mathematics and Artificial Life Models

**The Mandelbrot Set**

**Decidability Question**:
- Penrose (1989) raised the question: Is the Mandelbrot set decidable?
- To make the question mathematically meaningful, it was put into a new theory of computation over the real numbers developed by Blum, Shub, and Smale (1989).

**Theorem on Deduction and Emergence**:
- **Observational CODEM's Figure 45.4 Schematic illustration of G Odel's theorem.**
- In a suitable choice of structure in the framework, Julia sets (most of them) and the Mandelbrot set are viewed as observationally emergent structures.

**Semantic Compositionality**:
- In a formal string system, we have a syntactic relation `Take as our Obs a semantic "meaning function" M`.
- The question about semantic compositionality is then: Does there exist a (computable) function `F` such that `M(5) = F(M(51') ..., M(sk))`?
- If yes, `M(5)` is deducibly emergent.
- If no, `M(5)` is observationally emergent.

**Two Basic Causes of Emergence**:
- **Nonlinearity of Interactions**: There is no superposition or interaction principle.
- **Large Number of Structures**: The number of structures (systems, entities) is often large (number > 0).

**Provocative Question on Emergence and the Laws of Nature**:
- Does emergence in some cases rank among the laws of nature (as contended by Mill, Lewes, and Morgan)?

**Examples of Hyperstructures**:
1. Higher-order organisms viewed as evolutionary products.
2. Hypercycles in the sense of Eigen and Schuster.
3. Coupled nonlinear dynamical systems with limit cycles and attractors.
4. Higher-order logic and set theory.
5. Higher-order graphs and networks.
6. Various types of hyperspaces, such as fractal spaces.
7. Cognitive processes where we successively build up knowledge through observations and interactions.
8. General technological constructions designed in a modular or levelwise way and metatype constructions in system theory.

**Varying Obs and Int Structures**:
- The higher-order structure principle can be used to synthesize new structures by varying the `Obs` and `Int` structures.
- In real-life evolution, `Obs` and `Int` may even play no role (as in higher-order logic considered syntactically).

**Communication or Information Processing**:
- The information-carrying capacity increases at each level in the successive formation of levels in a hyperstructure.
- Conditions on stability and autonomy may need to be imposed at each level, depending on the situation.

**Hyperstructures as a Language/Framework**:
- Hyperstructures should be thought of as a language/framework to describe complex problems, solutions, and situations.

### 46 Bioenergetic Foundations of Consciousness

**Bioenergetic Foundations of Consciousness**

**Introduction**:
- Consciousness is sustained by the flow of a particular form of chemical energy, phosphoryl chemical energy (phosphergy)
- This chemical energy is packaged in molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which can be written as **adenine-ribose-phosphate -phosphoryl-phosphoryl**
- Human consciousness depends on the profuse use of phosphoryl chemical energy (phposergy) by the brain
- Evolution of consciousness required the coevolution of a plentiful intake of oxidant (0) and reductant (R), constrained by the dynamics of the 0 and R intake hub, the pharynx

**Respiratory Intake**:
- The respiratory inflow of oxygen (O) is quasicontinuous
- Rate-limiting, but does not demand consciousness on its own

**Swallowing and Consciousness**:
- Intermittent garnering of R and initiation of swallow is what requires consciousness
- Swallowing of food, after conscious initiation, usually triggers reflex protective closure of the larynx
- The larynx has undergone extensive coevolution with the brain

**Phylogenetic Changes in Larynx**:
- In monkeys, added a subhyoid air sac to be used as an inflatable, elastic larynx plugging mechanism
- In apes, the homologous structure became solidified and elongated in humans
- Coordinated complexifications of the larynx and cerebrum were recognized during human embryonic/fetal development and postnatal maturation

**Phosphoryl Energy and Consciousness**:
- The phoshorgy price of consciousness is high, with 2.3 kilograms of ATP produced per day
- Only a limited amount of ATP can be made in a day
- The tenuous oxygen (O) intake requires continuous breathing, rather than intermittent as with R

**Evolutionary Consciousness**:
- Phosphoryl energy flow-dependent systems evolved through chance and necessity over millions of years
- **Bacterial-replicating systems** appeared, followed by metazoan animal systems (invertebrates and vertebrates)
- Vertebrate systems have a common hub for both O and R intake, enabling potential self-knowledge

---

#### Evolution of the Larynx in Vertebrates A Comparative Study

**Lungfish and Laryngeal Evolution:**
- In lungfish, a median fissure in the ventral wall of the posterior pharynx allows sufficient air to pass through for respiration (Goeppert, 1937)
- Complex laryngeal structure developed in vertebrates with successive additions, specialized by clade and cerebrum size
- Larynx behaves as a switch: closed during swallowing or open for passage of air
- Food swallowing closure is reflex in humans but not unconscious individuals; they may choke instead

**Evidence of Laryngeal Evolution:**
1. **Lungfish (Lepidosiren):** Larynx is a fissure with muscle fibers to close it, pharyngeal contractions force air into lungs
2. **Amphibians (Axolotl salamander):** Small plates of cartilage on either side of the slit give attachment for opening glottis muscles
3. **Newt Salamander:** Upper separated tip of each lateral cartilage forms arytenoid cartilage, allowing rotatory and tilting motion on cricoid ring
4. **Monotreme Mammals (Platypus and Spotted-nose Turtle):** Distinct thyroid cartilage present above cricoid with bilateral undivided thyroarytenoid fold and epiglottis, enlarging the open glottis
5. **Marsupial Mammals:** Elastic corniculate cartilages attached to arytenoids act as springs for reopening after closure
6. **Placental Mammals:** Thyroid cartilage free from cricoid, divided into vocal and vestibular folds with cuneiform cartilage as torsion springs
7. **Evidence Summary:** Indirect evidence used due to absence of fossil larynges; adaptations suggest coevolution with cerebrum development.

---

#### Evolution of Primate Larynges and Vocal Folds

**Laryngeal Anatomy and Evolution in Mammals**

**Marsupial Mammal**
- cornicular cartilage (bilateral)

**Placental Mammal**
- cuniciform cartilage; vocal fold; vestibular fold (all bilateral)

**Cercopithecoid Monkey**
- hyoid bone

**Pongid Ape**
- pre-epiglottic body

**Hominid Human**
- prominentia laryngis (Adam's apple); bemouthli; cranial view of adducted right vocal fold

**Primates**
- Laryngeal passage appears enlarged due to a cerebrum increase in size
- Arytenoids slide mediolaterally, creating a pentagonal open glottis (vs. quadrilateral in non-primates)
- Elastic membranes and ligaments help restore the intermediate open configuration

**Cercopithecoid Monkeys vs. Apes/Humans**
- Arytenoids slide mediolaterally in monkeys, while apes and humans have free arytenoids that rock back around the cricoarytenoid joint
- Primates: vocal process es diverge and expand the open glottis

**Specializations of Vocal and Vestibular Folds in Primate Behavior**
- In lemurs/New World monkeys: cusps on vocal folds create an inlet valve to prevent air passage and aid brachiation
- In Old World monkeys: downturned vestibular folds and median subhyoid air sac enhance laryngeal plug resistance to thoracic collapse during weight lifting
- In apes and humans: solidified subhyoid sac strengthens exit plug and provides resistance to thoracic collapse, as well as elasticity for speech formant versatility

**Human Vocal Folds vs. Non-human Primates**
- Human vocal folds lack cusps and are specialized for low-effort phonation with a paramedian axis of oscillation
- Humans have a protruding chin, which decreases mandible acceleration energy costs and preserves geniohyoid and genioglossus muscle mobility for speech formants.

---

#### Larynx and Cerebrum Co-Evolution Dissipative Structures in Vertebrate Development

**Larynx's Coevolution with Cerebrum**
- Larynx's coevolution may stem from its developmental origin in pluripotent branchial arch mesoderm of viscerocranium (Warwick and Williams 1973), which is derived from cranial neural crest.
- The above-discussed conjoint phylogenetic elaboration suggests that an underlying influence orchestrates the flow of energy in larynx with potential demands and behavioral repertoire of the cerebrum.
- Each effect recalls the organizing tendency attributed to flow of energy in a dissipative structure (Prigogine and Stengers 1979).
- Phosphoryl energy flow originates in mitochondria of ovum, channels through genome and its products, generating self-organizing dissipative structures.

**Larynx Development and Functioning**
- Protection of laryngeal airway during swallowing: Ardran et al. (1952), Courville (1953)
- Evolution of speech apparatus: Du Brul (1958), Farnsworth (1940)
- Laryngeal folding and thyroid cartilage as a spring: Fink (1974, 1975, 1986), Fink et al. (1976)
- Integration of swallowing and respiration in infant mammals: German and Crompton (1994)
- Comparative anatomy and physiology of the larynx: Negus (1929, 1962), Ramsey et al. (1955), Saunders et al. (1951)

**Biochemistry and Evolution**

- Invertebrate zoology: Meglitsch and Schram (1991)
- Principles of biochemistry: Lehninger et al. (1993), Zubay (1993)

### 47 The Hierarchical Emergence of Consciousness

**The Hierarchical Emergence of Consciousness**

**Introduction:**
- Human quest for self-awareness and understanding origins
- Science contributions: debunking geocentrism, evolution theory
- Expectations from science to answer ultimate questions
- Present discussion as a contribution to the problem but less ambitious
- Hierarchical organization of current knowledge based on observations of scientists and library visits

**Hierarchy:**
1. Culture
2. Emergent phenomena
   * Consciousness phase sequence
      * Assembly of assemblies
         * Sequence of neuron components: axon, dendrite, synapse, mitochondria, nucleus, cytoplasm, protein membrane, nucleic acid, phospholipid, ATP, amino acids, inorganic chemistry, atomic physics
      * Nonlinearity leads to emergence of robust entities in biology: eddies, tsunamis, tornados, Great Red Spot on Jupiter
      * Emergent entities at each hierarchical level: atoms form molecules, proteins create biological cells, organisms compose human culture.
4. Linear systems vs nonlinear systems
- Easier analysis for linear systems with simple causes and effects
- Biological realm is rich due to nonlinearity and emergence of new entities
5. Physical scientists' preference for simplest theories
- Not always appropriate in biology, where complexity abounds
6. Nonlinearity leading to emergence: trampoline example
  * Escape energy of a child on the trampoline is square of their weight
  * Two children standing together have extra escape energy (2Wa Wb) as attractive force or binding energy.

#### Combinatorial Complexity in Social and Neural Assemblies

**The Hierarchy of Knowledge and Nonlinearity in Biology**

**Variety of Themes in Atomic Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**:
- Electrostatic and chemical valence energies bind atoms of a molecule of benzene
- Membrane organization of a living cell organizes itself as a molecular bilayer
- Flame of a candle expresses balance between nonlinear localizing effect of combustion and dispersive effect of thermal diffusion

**Hierarchy of Knowledge and Levels**:
- Appropriate dynamic laws differ at each level of the hierarchy
- Not one science, but a collection of them, each wedded to a particular level
- Experts must master detailed theory for their level to avoid being a dilettante

**Reductionist Approach Challenged**:
- Reductionism does not imply the ability to reconstruct the universe from fundamental laws
- Constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with scale and complexity issues

**Cell Assembly Theory in Neuroscience**:
- Above nerve cell level is "assembly of neurons"
- Emergent phenomenon at this level is the "cell assembly" concept introduced by Donald Hebb
- Cell assembly can be widely dispersed throughout brain, integrate concepts stored in different regions
- Advantages over individual neuron: robust to loss of information and can integrate concepts

**Metaphor of Human Culture**:
- City residents organized into interest groups, each normally dormant but can be ignited by external events
- Example: NRA members respond to proposed gun control law, motorcycle gang responds to loss of half their members with recruitment drive

**Important Points in Cell Assembly Theory**:
- Neuron may participate in many different assemblies, vital for determining number of assemblies
- This multiple participation is crucial for understanding the organization and functioning of the brain.

---

#### Hierarchical Emergence of Consciousness Levels of Abstraction in Neuroscience

**Hebb's Cell Assembly Properties**
- Hebb's cell assembly shares two basic properties with an individual neuron:
    - Threshold for stimulation below which it remains quiescent
    - All-or-nothing activity
- These properties can be propagated through the hierarchy of assemblies

**Learning to Read Example**
- Learning to read involves organizing assemblies of neurons in primary visual area of cortex
- Assemblies become interconnected, forming higher level "assemblies of assemblies" (second-order)
- Continues up the hierarchy: words, ideas, songs, tools, personalities, languages, cultural configurations, possible worlds

**Hierarchical Complexity**
- The number of possible structures at each level precludes listing them all
- Practitioners at different levels must study their own domain independently due to a "combinatorial barrier" between adjacent levels
- Diagram in Figure 47.1 illustrates the hierarchical organization, with each shaded disk representing the domain of definition for that level
- At each level, variables from higher levels appear as parameters and boundary conditions, while averages of dynamics at lower levels emerge as new equations (Fj = 0)

#### Hierarchical Emergence of Consciousness from Brain Activity

**The Emergence of Consciousness**

**Interesting Events in the History of the Universe**
- Evolution of consciousness: a phenomenon becoming accepted as a subject for serious study

**Hierarchical Organization of Knowledge**
- Diagram showing branches of science (Figure 47.1)
- Aim is to show how consciousness might fit into hierarchical description of knowledge

**Materialist vs. Dualist Perspectives on Consciousness**
- Materialist: All reality can be reduced to the laws of physics and chemistry, consciousness has no causal effectiveness
- Dualist: Consciousness is "something more than" brain activity, interacts with it
- Neither position feels comfortable from everyday experience or philosophical standpoint

**Hierarchical Perspective on Consciousness**
- Brain itself is a hierarchical structure with multiple levels of dynamical activity
- Consciousness emerges as a level of mental activity involving interactions among neuron assemblies organized into thought trains
- Traditional dispute between monism and dualism is superseded by acknowledging the dynamical realities at all scientific hierarchy levels

**Psychic Entities and Understanding Their Interactions**
- Psychic entities are complex phenomena, progress has been made but understanding their interactions is limited
- Natural science is not in a position to deny the possibility of consciousness emerging at a hierarchical level that monitors and guides brain neurodynamics

**Location of Consciousness**
- Introspection suggests consciousness is a "little spotlight" located behind the forehead, seeing disjoint ideas or feeling physical sensations
- Daniel Dennett argues against this, suggesting cognition is distributed throughout the brain
- Understanding the nature and locus of consciousness requires considering how it emerges from the biological hierarchy (cytology, biochemistry, chemistry)

**Hypercycle Theory on Emergence of Life**
- Suggests that life emerges from a hierarchical structure of cyclic reaction networks (hypercycles)
- Catalytic cycles, autocatalytic cycles, and basic catalytic cycles are nested and interacting in this hierarchy
- Energy, mass, and information are traded back and forth along the arrows
- Biomathematicians need a broader perspective to understand hypercycles

**Minimal Theory of Biological Organization: The Lambda Calculus**
- Algebraic theory introduced by Alonzo Church in 1941 for studying computability of mathematical algorithms
- Fontana and Buss use it to consider how atoms organize themselves into molecular structures
- Level 0: Self-copying objects or simple ensembles of copying objects
- Level 1: New object class made of Level 0 objects, self-maintaining organizations
- Level 2: Self-maintaining metaorganizations composed of Level 1 organizations

#### Interdisciplinary Approaches to Consciousness A Hierarchical Perspective

**Hierarchical Emergence of Consciousness**

**Mathematics and Life Process**:
- Mathematics not used to describe dynamical details of life process
- Used to study organization of creatures

**Consciousness Hierarchy**:
1. **Cultural configuration**
2. **Phase sequence**
3. **Complex assembly**
4. **Assembly of assemblies**
5. **Assembly of neurons**
6. **Multiplex neuron**
7. **Nerve membrane**
8. **Membrane protein**

**Consciousness Alteration**:
- Can be altered by chemicals that bind to membrane proteins and block ionic transport
- Routinely switched off/on by anesthetic agents that change synaptic contacts between cells

**Thought Formation**:
- Thought is stored in complex assemblies formed through years of learning
- Interacts with the culture in which it develops

**Intercourse Between Levels**:
- Intense intercourse between levels, from nerve membrane ion channels to cultural interactions
- Consciousness emerges from assemblies of assemblies of neurons

**The "Hard Problem"**:
- Chalmers' question: What is the extra ingredient beyond mere mechanism?
- Traditional approaches (soul, denial) unacceptable in natural science

**Suggestions for the Extra Ingredient**:
1. Consciousness embodied in a quantum mechanical wave function
2. Consciousness as a new primitive property like mass or electrical charge
3. Consciousness as an emergent phenomenon that cannot be reduced to lower levels

**Schrodinger's Perspective**:
- The reason we cannot find our sentient self is because it is the world picture itself

**Interdisciplinary Research**:
- Requires collaboration between chemists, biologists, physiologists, psychologists, sociologists, and ethnologists
- Exciting new research in interdisciplinary studies of consciousness

**Andrew Weil (Chapter 48):**
- Physician studying effects of psychoactive drugs on mind
- Recounts visions, shared hallucinations, and subjective phenomenology induced by natural compounds
- No understanding of how these chemicals work despite neural network theories, microtubules, quantum theory.

**Brian Josephson and Tethys Carpenter (Chapter 49):**
- Perception of music as a fundamental component of reality
- Relationship between process of life and aesthetics
- Beauty is irrational and essential to understanding consciousness.

**Arthur Deikman (Chapter 50):**
- Spiritual experience and nature of consciousness
- Receptive mode necessary for understanding consciousness but instrumental mode should not be ignored.

**Richard Atkinson & Heath Earl (Chapter 51):**
- Positive effect of meditation on perceptual task
- Small effect compared to statistical uncertainty but may be significant.

**Jose-Luis Diaz (Chapter 52):**
- Consciousness as a process that unfolds in time

### 48 Pharmacology of Consciousness A Narrative of Subjective Experience

**Pharmacology of Consciousness: A Narrative of Subjective Experience**

**Background:**
- The author is a botanist and physician with an interest in natural medicine and placebo responses
- Past work involved research on psychotropic plants and drugs, including marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, and South American hallucinogenic plants
- Experiences from this past work inform the author's understanding of mind-body interactions and healing

**Puzzles in Ethnopharmacology:**
1. An animal study: Unresolved neurochemical mechanisms behind complex experiences induced by psychoactive drugs
2. A plant study: Lack of understanding how unusual experiences are elicited from specific plants and their associated hallucinogenic properties

**Story of Marijuana Research at Boston University (1968):**
- Intent to study marijuana's effects on human beings without expectations or prior experience
- Harvard's resistance due to fear of marijuana leading to heroin addiction among students
- Eventual use of non-Harvard students as subjects, resulting in physiological changes but no significant alterations of consciousness for marijuana-naive individuals

**Three Factors Affecting Drug Experiences:**
1. **Drug**: Pharmacological nature, dose, and route of administration
2. **Set**: People's conscious and unconscious expectations
3. **Setting**: Environment in which the drug is taken, including social context and personal mindset

**Limitations in Using Pharmacology to Explain Human Experience:**
- Complex experiences induced by psychoactive drugs cannot be fully understood through neurochemical or neurobiological analysis alone
- Unconscious expectations play a significant role in determining experiences and are difficult to elucidate.

---

#### Ayahuasca Visions and Dreams in Amazonian Shamanism

**Interactions between Factors: Pharmacology, Set, and Setting**
- **Pharmacology**: The study of drugs and their effects on living organisms
- **Set**: Physical environment in which a drug is taken
- **Setting**: Social and cultural environment
- Interaction of these factors creates unique experiences for individuals at specific times and places
- Pharmacology alone cannot explain these interactions
- Pharmacologists often overlook the importance of set and setting, focusing only on pharmacology
- Experimentally administered doses of amphetamines or barbiturates can cause opposite effects (sleep vs. alertness) compared to their known actions in animals or humans

**Ayahuasca: Traditional Healer's Story - Manuel Cilrdova**
- Kidnapped as a young boy by Amahuaca Indians, trained as healer using ayahuasca
- Ayahuasca: Hallucinogenic beverage made from Banisteriopsis caapi vine and DMT-containing leaves
- Inactivation of monoamine oxidase by harmine allows for oral consumption of active DMT
- Indians claim they learned the technique through visions, not trial and error
- Cilrdova's training sessions with chief involved select group, elaborate rituals to fix essential tribal life circumstances.

#### Exploration of Bufo Alvarius Venom as Hallucinogen

**Bufo Alvarius (Sonoran Desert Toad)**

**Description:**
- Large toad, almost football size
- Hibernates underground during winter
- No predators due to venom and size
- Unique enzyme converts bufotenin into 5-Me O-DMT
- Venom contains up to 15% 5-Me O-DMT

**Vision Experience:**
- Intense feeling of rapport among group
- Drinking in unison and quiet reverie
- Subtle chants led by chief
- Progression of visions with color vistas and animal appearances

**Credibility:**
- Uncertain credibility without personal experience or confidence in informant
- Believable due to related experience with related substance

**Bufo Alvarius Venom as Hallucinogen:**
- First proved hallucinogen from an animal source
- Collection and milking of venom can be harmful to animals if not done properly
- 5-Me O-DMT gets into system efficiently when smoked, neurotoxicity destroyed or largely destroyed

**Historical Use:**
- Unknown origin, possibly pre-columbian times
- Monograph in the University of Texas Press published in 1960s and early 1970s mentioned its psychoactivity
- Significant numbers of people collecting toads for hallucinogenic purposes since then.

**Challenges:**
- Threat to species due to urban growth and collection for venom.
- Proper milking techniques are essential to avoid harming the animals.

#### Visionary Journey with Salvia divinorum

**Salvia Divinorum: A Potent Hallucinogenic Plant**

**Background:**
- Salvinorin A, most potent natural hallucinogen discovered
- Grows readily and in widespread cultivation
- Enormous yield from leaves, easily purified
- Psychedelic underground interest
- No legal restrictions as it's not a controlled substance

**Uses:**
- Traditionally used by Mazatec shamans during ceremonies
- Taken orally or inhaled like freebase cocaine
  - Most potent natural hallucinogen yet discovered (200-500 mcg)
  - Terrifying experience, little potential for abuse

**Experience:**
1. Beginner's dose: emulsion from about twenty pairs of leaves
2. Larger dose six months later: essential to take in night and darkness
3. Visionary journey described by shaman beforehand
4. Progression of visions, including flowers, giant fruits, burning cross, heavy feeling
5. Shaman stops session due to noise; imagery returns stronger on return journey
6. Hallucination in meadow with a man in white robe (possible saint)
7. Woke up the next morning, feeling no adverse effects.

**Chemical and Pharmacological Studies:**
- L.J. Valdes, chemist who worked extensively with Salvia divinorum
- Described second experience in detail for Journal of Psychoactive Drugs
8. Quoted information from Valdes' paper published in The Journal of Psychoactive Drugs.

---

#### Exploring Hallucinogens and their Effects on Consciousness

**Hallucinations and Personal Reflections**

**The Hallucination Experience**:
- Complete, visual, aural, and tactile
- Unable to analyze or understand using pharmacology or neural networks
- Acknowledges the "quality of mystery in the universe"
- Mystery can be experienced but not fully understood intellectually

**Placebo Medicine and Psychoactive Drugs**:
- Placebo responses are healing responses from within, triggered by belief
- Ideal is to elicit healing response without treatment
- Use of "active placebos" - treatments both doctor and patient believe in
- All psychoactive drugs are active placebos

**Quantum Theory and Consciousness**:
- Possible link to role of quantum effects in phenomena
- Consistency between neurobiological research and human experience is desirable
- Quantum physics provides a model to bring these two realms together

**Terrence McKenna's Speculations**:
- Ingestion of psychedelic plants like mushrooms may have triggered evolution of human consciousness
- Psychoactive plants are "windows on neurobiology and conscious experience"
- Absence of useful research due to criminalization of these substances is unfortunate

**Experience with Salvia Divinorum**:
- Encountered an intense experience after inhaling the concentrated extract
- Felt enveloped by a higher-dimensional lattice, with a sense of reality ending
- Disturbing psychically and left feeling disturbed for some time
- Now believes oral administration is a wiser way to interact with the plant

### 49 What Can Music Tell Us about the Nature of Mind A Platonic Model

**Understanding Music: Conventional Biological Terms vs. Subtle Aspects of Mind**

**Music as a Complex Phenomenon:**
- Difficult to explain using conventional biological terms alone (e.g., ability to recognize patterns)
- Specific forms have a unique "generative capacity" or "fertility" not found in arbitrary sounds

**Special Forms in Music:**
- Short, discrete units with distinctive harmonic, melodic, and emotional patterning
- Function as germs for elaborations throughout the composition

**Musical Ideas vs. Memes:**
- Resemble "memes" of Dawkins (1989)
- Cannot be fully accounted for within conventional frameworks

**Effects on Consciousness:**
- Special effects contrast with those of mediocre composers or mechanical procedures
- Skilled composers intuitively aware of creative potentials in elementary sounds

**Explanations for Music's Specificity:**
1. **Genetic Explanations**: Difficult to account for the majority of musical ideas as they don't have correlates in natural world; no selective advantage in possessing sensitivity to them.
2. **Theory of Everything Type Explanations**: Attempts made by musical psychologists but seem inadequate at present stage. No scope for arbitrary factors to enter.
3. **Alternatives:** Seeking explanations beyond cultural and genetic explanations.

**Parallels Between Aesthetic Processes and Life Processes:**
- Further development of these parallels discussed elsewhere (Josephson & Carpenter, 1994)

---

#### Universal Mind Through Musical Patterns The Platonic Connection

**Comparison Between Music and Genes**
- Both are informational structures that play a key role in determining forms and activities
- Effective musical patterns: highly specific, functional
- Complexity comes from details at structural level, related to function in a complex way with arbitrary aspects

**Music Parallels in Organisms**
- Specific gene structures generate effective functional systems
- Genes do not produce effects in isolation
- Functional descriptions simpler than detailed structural ones

**Music Semantics**
- Internal: related to maintenance of organism
- External: related to interactions with environment
- Some components have external reference, others significant only within the piece

**Mind and Music**
- Intelligent mind development centers around use of ideas and thought
- Individual minds make use of adaptations in same way as organisms use genes
- Collective or universal mind entailed in model: Platonic picture with preexisting ideas in a mind sphere
- Study of music can inform aspects of mind not accessible through conventional studies.

### 50  Intention Self and Spiritual Experience A Functional Model of Consciousness

**The Spiritual Traditions and Consciousness**

**Overview:**
- The spiritual traditions have explored consciousness for thousands of years
- Their findings should be of interest to scientists building a comprehensive theory of consciousness
- However, using their data faces difficulties due to the negative connotations of "spiritual" and "mystic" in science

**Science's Antipathy:**
- The words "spiritual" and "mystical" are often used pejoratively by scientists
- Scientists may shy away from these terms due to the association with unfounded behaviors and religious dogma
- However, there is a distinction between the circus sideshow variety of spiritual experiences and those that come from disciplined perceptual development

**Spiritual Perception:**
- Spiritual perception transcends sensory information and emotional fits
- It is not about visions or other sensory experiences, but rather a different way of knowing
- Examples: Walter Hilton's teachings on true contemplation, Zen's view on makyo (disturbing illusions)

**Mystical Consensus:**
- There is remarkable concordance among mystics from various cultures and epochs about spiritual consciousness and attainment
- This consistency lends credence to their statements, impressing many people who have studied the mystical literature
- Mystics tend to be practical phenomenologists rather than metaphysicians, emphasizing "Taste and you will know"

**Themes in Mystical Literature:**
1. **Another Dimension**: Reality is perceived in a radically different way, as in Sufi teachings on the hidden world
2. **True Self**: Human beings are confused about their essential self, as illustrated by Buddhist teachings on non-dual nature
3. **Nonattachment**: The importance of detaching from desires, as in Upanishads' teaching on immortality through severing ties
4. **Meditation**: Practicing zazen (meditation) is the most important thing, according to a 20th-century Zen Master

**The Instrumental Consciousness Mode:**
- As adults and scientists, we primarily operate in the object-mode of consciousness
- This mode is highly functional and serves the intent of acting on the environment
- An example: driving in heavy traffic, where we are focused on the objective world to survive.

---

#### Intentional Shifts in Consciousness Instrumental vs Receptive Modality

**Self, Intention, and Consciousness**

**The Survival Self**:
- A self that is object-like, localized, and separate from others
- The "survival self" - focused on acting on the environment to survive
- Characterized by instrumental consciousness: focal attention, sharp perceptual/cognitive boundaries, logical thought, reasoning
- Relies on body rules - how we learn about objects through repeated object-oriented actions

**Receptive Consciousness**:
- The mode used for experiencing pleasure (e.g., enjoying a summer day) and taking in the environment
- Characterized by diffused attention, paralogic thinking, intuition, fantasy, and sensual dominance over formal aspects

**Meditation and Renunciation**:
- Meditation emphasizes **allowing (receptive mode intent)** rather than acting (instrumental mode)
- Renunciation is a prominent feature of spiritual practices, but often misunderstood as giving up all pleasures

**Experiment: Changing Intention to Alter Perception**
- Try analyzing someone's face with the intent to make a model vs. receiving and just taking in the experience
- Most people report a difference between the two intentions, describing it as "richer" or "deeper" in the receptive mode

---

#### Transcending Self-Centeredness The Zen Retreat Experience

**Exercises for Shifting Consciousness Mode**

**Instrumental vs. Receptive Mode**:
- In instrumental mode, others seem "stuffed" and have no presence
- Receptive mode allows for spiritual development and connection with the world

**Practicing Receptive Consciousness**:
- Can be practiced with objects like trees or flowers
- Shift from instrumental to receptive consciousness through analysis and allowing manifestation

**Limitations of Self-Forgetting**:
- Decreasing dominance of self is necessary but not sufficient for spiritual development
- Further development of receptive consciousness requires "forgetting the self"
- This means reducing dominance of survival self and permitting a radically different sense of self and perception of environment

**Spiritual Practices**:
- Meditation and renunciation serve to de-emphasize the survival self
- Service is an other-centered practice that can shift focus from self to requirements of task
- Spiritual practices link sense of self to a larger context beyond instrumental consciousness

**Consciousness Formula**:
C = f(I,S) - Summarizes the relationship between intention (I), self (S), and consciousness experience.

---

#### Balancing Conscious Modes for Life Satisfaction

**Characteristics of Instrumental vs Spiritual Selves**

**Instrumental Self**:
- Based on survival strategy of acquiring and defending
- Underlies traditional vices like greed and jealousy, crimes like murder
- Experienced as separate from environment
- Focused on control and acquisition
- Prone to boredom, frustration with loss of control
- Lacks meaning and satisfaction beyond basic needs

**Spiritual Self**:
- Not experienced as separate from the environment
- Perceived as permeated by the environment
- Transparent or invisible
- Connection to a larger process, experience of service
- Provides different perception of self

**Effects of Instrumental Consciousness**:
- Frustration in attempting to grasp pleasure (e.g., trying to drink water)
- Limited perspective on consciousness and meaning
- Disconnection from environment and others leads to fear of death

**Implications for Psychology**:
- Difficulty addressing existential problems with current theories
- Need for a functional model of consciousness to understand self-centered lives
- Importance of recognizing both instrumental and spiritual modes

**Balance between Modes**:
- When needs of task or others are primary, spiritual self can be engaged
- Allows harmonious interaction between the two modes instead of alternating
- Experience of being both active and guided at the same time

---

#### Transcendental Perception in Creativity and Spirituality

**The Need for Science to Embrace Spiritual Traditions**

**Understanding Creative States and Consciousness**:
- Writers, artists, athletes, scientists, performers, psychotherapists experience a "magical state" of "choiceless action" or "flow"
- This state is characterized by reduced influence of the survival self
- Personal experiences from various realms of consciousness can provide valuable perspective and framework for theory development

**The Need to Recognize Connected Consciousness**:
- Connected, other-centered consciousness is needed to address global issues like overpopulation, pollution, war
- This mode of consciousness has been traditionally associated with mystics
- The discoveries from the mystical traditions need to be recognized as serving a vital function and integrated into science

**Potential for Developing Perceptual Abilities**:
- Infants have vast cognitive and perceptual potential that goes unutilized
- This potential may depend on stimuli and requirements imposed by culture
- Development of this capacity could require diminished activity of competing circuits, like the survival self

**The Role of Intention and Self in Spiritual Experience**:
- Service does not mean instrumental mode functions cannot be utilized, but in the service of other-centered goals
- Understanding the functional role of intention and self enables detecting bogus spiritual teachers who rely on threat, reward, or flattery to motivate followers

**Notes**:
- **1.** Spiritual experiences vs. theological interpretations associated with religions
- **2.** Museums can hinder aesthetic experience by not facilitating a shift to the receptive mode
- **3.** Service does not mean instrumental mode functions cannot be utilized, but in the service of other-centered goals
- **4.** Almost everyone thinks they don't earn enough money and specify a sum twice their income as "enough"

### 51 Enhanced Vigilance in Guided Meditation Implications of Altered Consciousness

**Guided Meditation and Enhanced Vigilance: A Study on Altered Consciousness and Perceptual Performance**

**Introduction:**
- Studies have shown that meditation and REST (Reduced Environmental Stimulation Technique) induce altered levels of consciousness
- Both practices require a reduction in sensory stimulation through focused attention or experimental manipulation
- This study aimed to assess the effect of one hour of guided meditation vs. chamber REST on perceptual performance using Signal Detection Task (SDT)

**Method:**
1. **Subjects**: 52 volunteers, randomly assigned to chamber REST (N=26) or guided meditation (N=26) conditions
2. **Materials and Procedure:**
   - Experimental sessions conducted in a temperature-controlled, lightproof, sound-attenuated REST chamber
   - Subjects performed SDT on a computer after instructions: detect the presence of an enemy 'E' among friendly characters 'F'
3. **Pre-testing:**
   - 12 practice trials to reduce likelihood of practice effects
   - 36 pretest trials completed before exposure period
4. **Exposure Periods:**
   - Chamber REST: subjects rested comfortably for one hour
   - Guided meditation: subjects listened to a recorded tape with breathing exercises, focused attention training, and visualization of moon images
5. **Post-testing:**
   - Subjects completed 36 SDT trials after the exposure period
   - Each trial consisted of presenting a sequence of letters 'F' or 'E', subject's task was to detect the presence of an enemy
6. **Data Collection:**
   - Subjects were required to respond within 5 seconds and move the chair for next trial initiation.

---

#### Enhanced Vigilance with Guided Meditation A Comparative Study

**Atkinson and Earl Study: Enhanced Vigilance with Chamber REST and Guided Meditation**
- The study investigated effects of chamber REST and guided meditation on perceptual vigilance for weak signals using a visual Stroop task.
- Participants were exposed to strong, weak, or no signal trials before and after the experimental conditions (pretest and posttest).

**Results:**
1. Significant main effects found in Time of Measurement (pretest vs. posttest) analysis of variance (ANOVA):
   - F(1, 50) = 5.98, P<0.025 for Sensory Stimulation Level x Measurement Time interaction
   - F(2, 100) = 344.37, P<0.001 for Signal Strength
2. No significant differences between chamber REST and guided meditation on strong or no signal pretest trials.
3. Chamber REST and guided meditation showed increased weak signal hits from pretest to posttest (M=5.65 vs. M=6.38).
4. Guided meditation had a greater number of weak signal hits on the posttest compared to chamber REST (M=7.50 vs. M=6.38).

**Discussion:**
- Enhanced perceptual vigilance for weak signals with both conditions without increased false alarms.
- Stronger effect found in guided meditation than chamber REST on posttest trials.
- Explanation: Focused attention and cognitive processing shift towards a holistic, receptive mode during meditation.

### 52 The Stream Revisited A Process Model of Phenomenological Consciousness

**Phenomenological Consciousness Model: The Stream Revisited**

**Introduction:**
- Scientific approach to consciousness requires a transparent theory
- Develop robust theories of consciousness and outline models of phenomenological consciousness
- Equivalent to awareness, sensations, feelings, thoughts, mental images, intentions (Oxford dictionary)
- Seven essential features: temporality, processing activity, content, qualia, totality, attention, levels
- Petri net diagram will be developed by defining these main features
- Guidelines: William James' "stream of consciousness" metaphor and European Phenomenology
- Assumption: Conscious phenomena are both brain and mental states

**Stream of Consciousness:**
- Core idea: Consciousness unfolds in time (William James)
- Representation: Arrow of time with a brief duration "window" (Figure 52.1)
- Temporal aspect: Subjective sensation of time is complex (Figure 52.2)

**Features of Consciousness:**
- **Temporality**: Unfolding of consciousness in time
- **Processing Activity**: Mental factors arise, undergo processing, and disappear
- **Content**: Four broad classes: sensations (s), emotions (e), thoughts/mental images (t), intentions (i) (Figure 52.3)

---

#### Qualia Attention and Streams of Consciousness A Graphical Model

**The Relationship Between Consciousness and Qualia**

**Conscious Events:**
- Complex and nonlinear relationships between classes, species, and qualia
- Causal relations among conscious events are intricate
- Occurrences may appear and disappear from awareness by crossing the consciousness "threshold"

**Qualia:**
- Defined as the qualitative aspects of mental events (raw feels)
- Permit classification of sensations and emotions
- Personal and unique to each individual
- Coincide with content in exhaustive description

**Description of Specific Qualia**
- Similar to describing unique peculiarities of a botanical species

**The Feature of Totality:**
- Unity of experience
- Disparate contents can appear simultaneously
- Coordination and mixture of events through functional "binding"
- Endows consciousness with its holistic structure

**Consciousness Diagram:**
- Represents qualia by different arrow colors (Figure 52.4)
- Formalizing relationship between color and qualia requires more developed model

**The Last Two Features of Consciousness:**
- Attention
  - Permits selection of stimuli for further processing
  - Manifest in behavior or covertly without expression
  - Several forms: focal, panoramic, aimed, receptive, tenuous, or strong
- Expanding the "stream" metaphor to include attention's margins (attention) and depth (levels).

---

#### Dynamic Stream of Awareness and Levels of Consciousness

**The Forms of Covert Attention**
- **Covering Field**: narrow (A) or panoramic (B)
- **Direction**: aimed (A) or receptive (C)
- **Intensity**: tenuous (A) or strong (D)

**Unfolding Attention and the Petri Net Model**
- Can be incorporated in the Petri net developed in Figure 52.5 as the margin or boundary of the net (Figure 52.7)
- The surface is defined by successive occasions with their dynamic contents and qualia, while attention constitutes the margins and shape of the stream itself

**Levels of Attention**
- Two levels: fast, passive, and automatic (functionally coupled to orientation reactions) or slow, active, and controlled
- Automatic attention operates in a state of normal vigilance
- Control led attention occurs during self-consciousness

**Consciousness and the Awareness Threshold**
- Vast and parallel unconscious cognitive processing vs. selective and restricted conscious processing
- Conceptualized as an "awareness threshold" represented by a moving layer of surface "visibility" in the depth of the stream
- Depending on historical and adaptation determinants, some cognitive information items reach the threshold and undergo further processing until they disappear from awareness
- Levels of consciousness: dream (except for lucid dreaming), awake (normal vigilance), self-consciousness, and ecstasy

**The Stream Model of Consciousness**
- Dynamic, ever-changing nature of phenomenological consciousness defined by contents and states in continuous progression
- No requirement for a "self" or "ego"; individuals are their actions
- Possible applications: empirical recording and analyzing conscious flow, developing a reliable "hermeneutic" or "heterophenomenological" procedure, studying specific aspects and operations of consciousness in literary criticism

## XI Overview

**Overview of Consciousness Science**
- Diverse views within scientific community regarding nature of consciousness
- No collective opinion, but topic is no longer taboo in science
- Importance of gathering more and better experimental data on consciousness
- Traditional scientific paradigm of reductive materialism challenged by some
- Three perspectives on future research: AI paradigms (Ian Marshall), empirical testing (Jean Burns), and broadening the framework of science (Willis Harman)
- Historical context: Bias towards determinism in modern science, questioning reductive view by prominent philosophers and scientists
- Downward causation as an issue in brain dynamics, challenged by evidence but ignored due to preference for machine-like models of brains.

### 53 Three Kinds of Thinking

**Three Kinds of Thinking: Serial Processing vs. Parallel Processing**

**Mathematical Models of Computation:**
- Two types: serial and parallel processing
- Human thinking utilizes both processes, as well as a third one

**Serial Processing:**
- Slow, step-by-step
- Rule-following fashion
- Similar to personal computer's style of computation
- Examples: mental arithmetic
- Weaknesses: poor at pattern recognition or complex skills

**Parallel Processing:**
- Rapid combination of data into meaningful wholes
- Style of more recently developed parallel processors
- Learns by association, not reason
- Lacks language and explicit rule-following abilities
- Examples: face recognition, driving

**Serial vs. Parallel Processors:**
- Complementary strengths and weaknesses
- Serial processors good for precise tasks, but poor at pattern recognition
- Parallel processors learn by association, but lack language capabilities

**Three Kinds of Thinking (cont'd): Unconscious Phenomena**

**Phenomena Beyond Serial or Parallel Processing:**
1. Consciousness and the unity of consciousness
2. Human agency, freedom, and responsibility
3. Creative thinking
4. Higher psychological processes: truth, creativity, humor, spirituality
5. Meanings, intentionality, semantics

**Three Cognitive Processes (according to some psychodynamic and religious systems):**
1. Prepersonal
2. Personal
3. Transpersonal

**Freud's Dichotomy: The Ego and the Id**
- Contrast between parallel and serial processing
- Confirmed by psychodynamic research

**Limitation of Mechanical Models:**
- Difficult to provide a mechanical model for higher modes of function, such as insight and evolution towards higher modes.

**Jung's Individuation:**
- Focus on evolutionary process
- Possible indication that human evolution may not be reducible to serial or parallel processing

**Higher Mental Processes: Contacting a Timeless Realm**
- Distinction between three kinds of thinking: here-and-now (point mode), personal narratives (line mode), general patterns in art, science, or philosophy (construct mode) and transcendent experiences (transcendent mode).

#### Empiricist Approach to Meaning through Associative Fields and Constrained Networks

**Parallel vs. Serial Processing Styles:**
- Parallel processing: people move about at parties to find compatible subgroups, decentralized behavior
- Serial processing: bureaucratic rule-based central organization
- Both styles coexist in groups' life
- Neither describes the evolving culture of a relationship or group which can develop new insights and values through shared experiences and explicit dialogue (Zohar and Marshall 1993)

**Semantics Background:**
- Reductive approach: try to reduce meanings to something more tangible, e.g., truth conditions, linguistic behavior, or syntax of a formal language but faces difficulties in implementation (Boden 1988; Searle 1992)
- Phenomenological tradition preserves richness and messiness of experience without clear connection to computational science or brain physiology. Functionalism bridges both camps but remains compatible with the theory presented here.

**Semantic Theory:**
- A parallel processor has no explicit language, only discriminative behavior that can be "taught" to respond to specific voices or faces
- Serial processors have fixed language and programs but cannot create new language or programs
- To add an explicit language to a parallel processor, we need a theory of meaning: [a] connotes [b] if [a] evokes [b] when consciousness system is on line. Associative meanings are not logical definitions; they're based on experience and can be holistic (music, metaphor) or empiricist (isolatable pointer readings).
- New concepts or attitudes can be defined first by long narratives or widespread social trends before a short name makes them explicit.

---

#### Evolution of Meaning and Language through Associative Matrix and Intentional Use

**Associative Meaning and Intention**
- Spontaneous imagery is a simultaneous response to several aspects of a situation
- This accords with experiences of children, animals, and cultures, who have associative meanings beyond their linguistic capacity
- Semantics precedes any fixed, conventional language
- Associative meaning is related to passive experience; there's also meaning in the sense of intention (e.g., "We mean to repaint the house this year")
- Conventional meanings or explicit meanings are agreements to follow given rules of interpretation

**Three Stages of Meaning Development**
- **Stage 0**: A stream of point-mode consciousness, without awareness of causal links between states
- **Stage 1**: Explicit awareness of the connection between mental contents [a] and [b], in the line mode (awareness across a time interval)
- **Stage 2**: The connotations of [a], which may apply ambiguously to a set [bI]...[bN]
- **Stage 3**: Intentional use of [a -+] to evoke [b], either in communication or in one's own thinking, denoting an explicit name if [a -+] has one and only one main value [b] (e.g., shouting to warn or intimidate)

**Communicating with Serial Processing System**
- People constantly learn new meanings, which cannot be explained by a single fixed serial processor
- The brain creates a sequence of serial processors tailored to the languages developed so far
- This accords with the intuition that one's thinking is not tied to any formal language and is not restricted by Gdel's Theorem on formal languages

#### Quantum Consciousness and Intentionality in Brain Processing A Proposed Model

**Theoretical Framework for Consciousness and Intentionality**

**Three Kinds of Processors in the Human Cortex:**
- Multiple and local interconnections within 1-2 mm
- Overlapping or interconnected parallel processors at a lower level
- Larger area networks, like primary visual cortex, and precise interconnections reminiscent of serial processors at a higher level

**Requirement for Consciousness:**
1. A set of alternatives is replaced by one definite alternative (conscious choice)
2. Change not determined by current physics (uniqueness of choice)
3. Each alternative was conscious before change (clear consciousness)
4. Choice favors system's survival or evolution (motivated)

**Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness:**
- Superposition of several states in a quantum system
- Collapse of the wave function as a possible explanation for consciousness
- States of clear consciousness correspond to specific measurements, like eigenstates
- Unclear state of consciousness is a superposition of several clear states before making a decision or focusing attention
- Physical and mental properties belong to the same entities but answer different questions

**Interaction between Quantum Field and Parallel Processor:**
- Neuron firing via synapses supports parallel processing
- Slower EEG potentials generated by nonfiring neurons may contain macroscopic quantum elements
- Two systems interact at every point: discrete firings and continuous EEG potentials

**Limitations of the Model:**
- Detailed issues ignored in this paper
- New type of processing model with three interacting kinds of brain computational processes within artificial intelligence.

### 54 The Possibility of Empirical test of Hypotheses About Consciousness

**Consciousness and Physical Laws**
- Discussion of three issues related to consciousness models
- **Physicalism vs Nonphysicalist Hypotheses**:
  - Physicalism: All aspects of consciousness can be explained by physical laws (reductionism) or not (emergent physicalism, dualism, monistic idealism)
  - Testability: Reductionism is testable if all aspects of conscious experience can be traced back to underlying physical mechanisms in the brain
  - Uncertainty: No way to differentiate emergent physicalism, dualism, etc., from reductionism as they claim some aspect of consciousness cannot be explained by known laws
- **Physical Characteristics of Mind/Brain Interface**
  - Various proposals about the physical nature of the brain-mind interface
    - Complex neural networks (Bateson, John)
    - Quantum mechanical processes (Penrose, Goswami, Stapp, Walker, Zeeman, Freeman, Crick, Koch)
    - Synchronous electrochemical oscillations (Zeeman, confirmed by experimental work)
    - Neural processes including synchronous oscillations and synaptic transmission (Crick)
    - Microtubules and their protein conformational changes (Hameroff)
  - Problem: Knowing which entities are conscious vs. nonconscious, especially for non-human beings or complete set of conditions necessary for human consciousness.

#### Consciousness and Free Will Theoretical Debates in Physics and Neuroscience

**Models of Consciousness**

**Free Will**:
- Some models have postulated that free will can act to select between alternative brain programs, independently of physical process
- This contradicts the second law of thermodynamics and cannot be reductionist

**Understanding Brain Functioning**:
- Thorough understanding of brain functioning is required to demonstrate whether free will exists or not
- It may take centuries to attain this level of understanding

**Contemporary Models of Consciousness**:
- Burns (1990, 1991) provided a comprehensive review of contemporary models of consciousness
- These models include:
  - **Deterministic processes**
  - **Quantum randomness**
  - **Emergent physicalism**

**Relationship with Parapsychology**:
- Burns (1993) discussed the relationship between these models and findings in parapsychology
- Crick and Koch (1990) proposed a neurobiological theory of consciousness

**Idealistic Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics**:
- Goswami (1989, 1993) proposed that consciousness creates the material world, based on quantum mechanics

**Biological Model of Consciousness**:
- Penfield (1975) and Hameroff (1987) proposed a biological model of consciousness
- Penrose (1989) suggested that consciousness can influence the brain's complexity

**Hyperspace Theory of Consciousness**:
- Sirag (1993a, 1993b) proposed a hyperspace theory of consciousness
- This theory is based on catastrophe theory, as developed by Zeeman (1976, 1977)

**Chaos Theory and Brain Functioning**:
- Skarda and Freeman (1987) proposed that the brain makes chaos to create order in sensory processing
- Stapp (1993) also explored the relationship between quantum mechanics, consciousness, and brain function

**Foundations of Parapsychology and Quantum Physics**:
- Walker (1975) discussed the foundations of parapsychological and paraphysical phenomena, in relation to quantum physics

### 55 Toward a Science of Consciousness Addressing Two Central Questions

**Consciousness: Strategy and Epistemology**

**Strategy: Defining Consciousness**
- Simple, everyday conscious awareness as a starting point
- Progress through simplest and most tractable cases first
- Alternate strategy: Synthesize understanding of all aspects of consciousness
  - Includes conscious awareness, intentionality, unconscious processes, perception, etc.
- Need for conceptual framework or organizing metaphor to comprehend various phenomena related to consciousness

**Epistemology: Understanding Scientific Knowledge**
- Confidence in scientific view of reality requires answering epistemological questions
- Circularity between studying mind and knowing about mental processes
- Importance of unconscious mental processes in constructing science
  - Influences creative/intuitive mind and scientific judgment
  - Perception, memory, attention, imagery, etc. have unconscious influences
- Unconscious contents and processes are major factors in constructing any society's form of science
- Questioning the objective nature of science based on subjective experiences of scientists
  - Preference for quantifiable data is a bias, not an intrinsic quality.

---

#### Exploring Consciousness Towards a Holistic Epistemology

**Training to Study Consciousness**
- Precedent for unconscious processes in training: psychology, anthropology, law
- Scientist exploring consciousness must be willing to undergo personal change

**Metaphors in Science**
- Metaphors used to understand unfamiliar concepts from familiar ones
- Problems arise when metaphors are confused with "true" descriptions of reality
- Modern science allows some nonquantifiable metaphors (organism, personality) but not consciousness metaphor

**Epistemology for Studying Consciousness**
- Dominant scientific epistemology may be inadequate
- Some quantum physicists propose compatibility with philosophical idealism
- Radically empirical or phenomenological epistemology proposed for studying consciousness:
  - Phenomenological/experiential approach, including subjective experience as primary data
  - Objective and unbiased, addressing both external and internal experience

---

#### Epistemology for Consciousness Studies in Holistic Perspective

**Epistemology for a Science of Consciousness**

**1. Open Inquiry and Public Validation:**
- Emphasis on open inquiry
- Goals may not be fully met due to complexity of inner experience
- Recognize limitations in knowledge, especially deep understanding of subjective experiences

**2. Unity of Experience:**
- Holistic approach
- Importance of subjective and cultural meanings
- Meaningful experiences not explained away by reductionism or physiological events

**3. Scientific Models and Metaphors:**
- Science deals with models representing aspects of reality
- Epistemology of subjectivity: Harman's "Toward a Science of Consciousness"

**4. Perennial Philosophy:**
- Reality composed of levels from least conscious to most conscious
- Human beings can grow and develop towards Spirit or Godhead
- Everything is connected, no separation between things

**5. Limitations of Current Scientific Models:**
- Western science limited to material world and upward causation only
- Restriction led to classical problems like mind-body problem, free will vs determinism, etc.

**6. Participatory Understanding:**
- Importance of personal experience in research
- Cooperative relationship between researcher and observed phenomenon

**7. Role of Personal Characteristics:**
- Researchers must be willing to undergo transformation through exploration
- Old epistemologies may need replacement by new ones over time

**8. Continuity and Transcendence:**
- Material world embedded in living universe within a realm of consciousness or Spirit
- Everything is part of the "great chain of being"

**9. Usefulness of Models:**
- Permissible if useful for ordering knowledge, even if they seem to contradict other models
- Classical examples: wave and particle models in physics.

#### Shift in Understanding Consciousness and Sciences Role A Cultural Evolution

**Wilber's Perspective on Consciousness Research**

**Current Situation**:
- Open-minded scientific spirit and tradition of public validation of knowledge should be retained
- Increasing public interest in transcendental experiences may push for development within science

**Challenges and Confusion**:
- Serious exploration of consciousness reveals discrepancies with mainstream Western science's worldview
- New paradigm ideas (quantum healing, holographic theory, chaos theory) do not go far enough in addressing underlying metaphysical assumptions

**Implications for Consciousness Research**:
- Western science is about understanding cause, denies consciousness as a causal reality
- Personal experience affirms the importance of choice and inner guidance, creates a dilemma
- Possibility that consciousness will end up being rebased on new ontological assumptions

**Proposed Approach**:
- Explore all aspects of human consciousness using an epistemology based on the nine characteristics
- Chart territory and identify potentially fruitful research areas
- Cultural shift towards subjective experience may open up bolder epistemological possibilities

**Significant Shifts in Scientists' Assumptions**:
- Changes in scientists' internalized assumptions and modes of perception can open up new possibilities for exploration.
