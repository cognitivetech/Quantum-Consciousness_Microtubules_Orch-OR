### Collective Intelligence

**Ultimate Computing and Cellular Automata**

**Universal Computer Automata**:
- Described by John von Neumann as a system that could solve any problem given sufficient area and time
- Today's computer technologists are considering implementing molecular scale automata

**Multidimensional Automata and Discreteness of Time and Matter**:
- Edward Fredkin of MIT considered multidimensional automata and the discreteness of time and matter
- Argues the universe is a cellular automaton whose cells are atomic and subatomic particles
- Sees the universe as made of information, with cellular automata being generalized primitive computers
- Cellular automata in conformational states could process biological information and be the substrate of consciousness

**Parallel Connectedness and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:
- Current trend in computer design is parallel connectedness, emulating the brain
- Electronic computers serially process quickly but struggle with qualitative functions like pattern recognition and judgment
- Jerome Feldman cites the example of interpreting "John threw a ball for charity" as having inherent ambiguities that require a highly parallel system to resolve
- Human brains can perform cognitive functions by subcognitive processes like recognizing patterns, making assumptions, and performing imaginative leaps

**Collective Intelligence**:
- A collective phenomenon is more than the sum of its parts, and has been explained by Cal Tech biophysicist John Hopfield's neural net models
- Putting many molecules in a box just increases collisions, but putting a billion billion molecules creates new phenomena like sound waves

### Parallelism

**Properties of Networks for Collective Effects**

**Parallelism**:
- Previous computer architectures were based on serial, sequential processing
- Serial processing is time consuming and can lead to chaotic output from a single error
- Brain's parallel nerve tracks are an alternative to serial processing
- Parallel computing involves multiple processors addressing different aspects of a problem asynchronously
- Requires reconciliation of multiple outputs through lateral connections
- Output is a consensus of the input and its processing

**Connectionism**:
- Inspired by the interconnectedness of neurons and cytoskeletal structures in the brain
- Modern computers have evolved to parallel processing, with 64,000 microprocessors (Connection Machine)
- Further evolution is multidimensional network parallelism (hypercubes)

**Coherent Cooperativity**:
- Processors in a network may be biased differently or perform different functions
- Parallel and laterally connected tracks of nerve fibers inspired the appreciation of parallelism

**Cytoskeletal Networks**:
- Highly parallel and interconnected, with millions to billions of subunits per nerve cell
- Smaller than microprocessors in computers

**Computing Power Comparison**:
- Microcomputer: 10^6 bits per second
- Human brain: 4 x 10^11 bits per second (assuming 40 billion neurons changing states hundreds of times per second)

### Connectionism

**Connectionism and Ultimate Computing**

**Parallel Systems**:
- Collective hierarchy of parallel systems, with cytoskeleton as ground floor
- Parallel systems rely on lateral connections and networks for sophisticated information processing

**Neural Nets**:
- Computer simulations of parallel connected networks (neural nets) develop cognitive-like functions at sufficient complexity
- Philosopher John Searle's argument: computers can do complex tasks without understanding essence, like sorting Chinese characters without understanding meaning
- Neural net models and connectionist network theory have emerged with multilevel networks to find optimal solutions

**Neural Net Energy Functions**:
- Characterized mathematically by John Hopfield (1982) and others
- Solutions to a problem can be understood in terms of minimizing an associated energy function
- Isolated errors or incomplete data can be tolerated within limits

**Minimizing Energy Functions**:
- Information (metaphorically) flows like rain, forming streams and rivers until stable states occur
- Multilevel networks allow neural nets to find optimal solutions, like finding the lowest point on a landscape

**Avoiding Depressions**:
- The trick is to avoid getting stuck in a tiny depression between two mountains
- Shaking the box after dropping a marble usually leads to finding the lowest point

### Cooperativity and Coherence

**Advancements in Brain Research: Neural Circuitry, Dynamic Structural Activities, Cytoskeleton, and Collective Effects**

**Neural Circuitry and Synapses**:
- Idea of strengthening specific synapses within neural circuits generated by Donald Hebb (1949)
- Cytoskeleton responsible for cytoplasmic rearrangements including dendritic spine formation and regulation
- Spines are branchings of dendrites, which themselves are branchings of neurons
- Prime candidates for synaptic plasticity, the cornerstone for brain learning and memory models

**Cooperativity and Coherence**:
- Collective effects manifest as: diffuse reverberation, sustained oscillation, phase transitions, and deterministic chaos in parallel networks (Choi and Huberman, 1984)
- Can exert long-range cohesion and executive level organization within parallel arrays
- Collective phase transitions in brain parallel arrays could be a fabric of consciousness
- **Neuronal Synapse**: Brain's fundamental subunit, but synaptic activities are orchestrated by the cytoskeleton
- Layers of cytoskeletal organization evident within neurons, and their participation in cognitive functions is unavoidable
- Highly branched cytoskeleton may be another dimension of brain organization, related to neuronal networks as a fractal
- Natural processes manifest fractals through long range correlation in the pattern
- Densely parallel interconnected networks of cytoskeletal structures resemble larger scale neural networks and can be viewed as fractal subdimensions

**Long Range Cooperativity and Collective Mechanisms**:
- Favored by the property of coherence, where peak energy excitations within an area occur in phase or simultaneously (like a laser)
- Coherence may arise from:
  - Top-down imparting of goals and intentions from the chief executive level (DeCallatay, 1986)
  - Underlying rhythm or beat to which all elements are tuned (rhythmic coupling among neurons)
  - Fundamental coherence at the protein assembly level

### Molecular Computing

**Concepts and Approaches in Computing: Biological Inspiration for Ultimate Computing**

**Coherency Model and Long Range Cooperativity:**
- **Frhlich's coherency model**: Focuses on time-independent effects, leading to order (stable states) in systems
- **Davydov's model**: Looks at time-dependent effects that propagate order through the system
- Solitons: Wave-like propagations of coupled conformational and electronic disturbances in biomolecular chains or lattices
- Complementary approaches to explain long range cooperativity in biology (Tuszynski, Paul, Chatterjee, and Sreenivasan, 1984)

**Molecular Computing:**
- Nanoscale computing to emulate brain structure and approach cognitive capabilities of the human brain
- Advantages of molecular computers:
  1. Limitations in current planar computer design and three-dimensional space usage
  2. Miniaturization limitations with silicon and gallium arsenide technologies
  3. Biomolecular devices may offer possibilities for self-repair or self-regeneration
  4. Certain types of analog, patterned computation are suitable for molecular computers
- Strategies for implementing nanoscale computing: switching in material arrays of polyacetylenes, Langmuir-Blodgett films, electro-optical molecules, proteins and other materials
- Interfacing between nanoscale devices and macroscale technologies is an obstacle with several possible solutions (engineering upward, optical communication, molecular wires, dont interface; build systems that are totally nanoscale)
- Technologies which may fulfill the latter possibility include ion beam nanolithography, molecular spectroscopy, quantum well devices, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)

**Information Flow in Conventional Computers:**
- Electronic current flow is the medium of information flow in conventional computers
- Solitons may be a more efficient mode of molecular computing at the nanoscale.

### Dynamic Pattern Representation

**Toward Ultimate Computing**

**Gates, Wires, and Switches**:
- Gates, wires, and switches may be worth trying to build
- Redundancy and parallelism may be necessary

**Biochemical Systems Inspiring Technological Imitations for Computer Design**:
- Many biological systems (DNA, antibodies, receptors, enzymes) were reviewed
- A major conclusion was that: "None of these materials is as rich in chemoelectric physical phenomena as are (cytoskeletal) microscopic biological objects.  Microtubules offer the most possibilities for inspiring chemically based computation."

**Dynamic Pattern Representation**:
- Processing of patterns or symbols is conducive to optimal computing
- Patterns can be dynamically represented by various mechanisms:
  - **Reaction-diffusion systems**
  - Holograms
  - Macrons
  - Cellular automata

**Reaction-Diffusion Systems**:
- Reaction diffusion systems are evolving patterns which result from reactions and product diffusion within a dynamic medium
- Biological reaction diffusion systems within the submembrane cytoplasm have been suggested as a mechanism of biological information representation
- **Conrad and Liberman (1982)**: Reaction diffusion patterns of the energy rich nucleotide, cyclic AMP, regulated by the membrane are the texture of cytoplasmic information
- Propagation and interaction of chemical, nonlinear waves lead to pattern formation in a number of chemical and biological media
- Similar phenomena have also been reported in retinal and cortical nerve nets and in heart muscle

### Reaction Diffusion Systems

**Ultimate Computing: Gates, Wires, and Switches**
- Attempts to build gates, wires, and switches for computing
- Redundancy and parallelism may be necessary
- Biochemical systems as inspiration for technological imitations in computer design?
  - Conclusion: **None of these materials is as rich in chemoelectric physical phenomena** as cytoskeletal microscopic biological objects.
  - Microtubules offer the most possibilities for inspiring chemically based computation. (Yates, 1984)
- Dynamic Pattern Representation in Processing:
  - **Patterns can be dynamically represented** by a number of mechanisms useful in AI and biological systems.
  - Reaction diffusion systems, holograms, macrons, and cellular automata.

**Dynamic Pattern Representation: Reaction Diffusion Systems**
- Evolving patterns resulting from reactions and product diffusion within a medium
- Biological reaction diffusion systems in submembrane cytoplasm suggested as information representation mechanism by Conrad and Liberman (1982)
  - Texture of cytoplasmic information is regulated by membrane
  - Propagation and interaction of chemical, nonlinear waves lead to pattern formation
- Examples: Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, amoeba cells responding to cyclic AMP pulses. (Winfree and Strogatz, 1984)
  - Characteristic patterns also reported in retinal and cortical nerve nets and heart muscle.
- Smaller scale reaction diffusion patterns are faster.

### Holograms - Macrons

**Ultimate Computing: Toward Holographic Computation and Macrons**

**Three-Dimensional Computer Simulations of Reaction-Diffusion Systems:**
- Filamentous organizing centers emit scroll ring patterns (Figure 1.10)
- Cytoplasmic microtubules and centrioles as potential organizing centers
- Dynamic activities release diffusing waves of calcium ions for sol-gel transformations
- Coding by microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) results in specific reaction-diffusion patterns

**Holograms:**
- Brain stores memory in a distributed manner, resistant to local damage
- Interference pattern theory for memory, learning, and cognitive functions
- Holography: recording and reconstructing wavefronts of interference patterns
  - Invented by Denis Gabor (1948), Nobel Prize winner
  - Technically significant with the arrival of lasers in the 1950s
  - Stores entire image file distributed across hologram, retaining focus or clarity on reillumination
- Holography as a potential distributed memory system and inspiration for brain models

**Macrons:**
- Morphogenesis: evolution of form from chaos
- Mathematical descriptions of dynamic biological form compared to various philosophical literature (Ralph Abraham)
- Macrons: collective vibrational patterns in nature (Abraham)
  - Physical, chemical, and electrical categories
  - Subdivided based on material state of the macron medium
- Example: Solid macron: vibrational pattern observed when a flat metal plate is transversely vibrated by external forces.

### Cellular Automata

**Cellular Automata**
- Complex behavior in cellular automata arises from collective activities of simple subunits
- Original cellular automaton: large number of identical cells organized uniformly
    - Cells are indivisible, finite-state subunits (cells in biology have complex actions)
    - Each cell communicates only with its neighbors
    - Neighborhood size and shape are the same for all cells
    - There's a universal clock that ticks at each generation
    - Transition rules determine how a cell changes based on its current state and neighbor states
- Simple neighborhood rules can lead to complex, dynamic patterns in cellular automata
- Similar concept to lattice models like a two-dimensional Ising generator

**Macrons**
- Stable modes of vibration or shape distortion in various media (plate, rubber ball, liquid)
- Depend on intrinsic controls (shape, compressibility, viscosity) and extrinsic controls (frequency, amplitude)
- Examples: Chladni nodal lines, Benard cells, smoke rings, opalescence, aurora borealis
- Thoughts may be considered macrons in the brain (patterns at dendritic surfaces or within nerve cells)
- Repetitive reinforcement of specific macrons can create structural learning mechanism.

### Metaphors of Consciousness

**Brain/Mind/Computer**

**2.1 Metaphors of Consciousness**:
- Information processing systems are evolving in both biological life forms and computer technologies
- Human consciousness, located in the human brain, is currently the most evolved information processing system
- Relationship between consciousness and structural brain activities is often referred to as the "brain/mind duality"
- To explain this duality, humans have historically perceived their minds in the context of predominant cultural themes, particularly information technologies

### Historical PerspectivesConsciousness as ...

**Brain/Mind/Computer Relationship:**
- Information substrate lies within biological cells
- Brain as organized assembly of billions of computers with emergent properties related to consciousness
- Hierarchy of brain organization may have a "secret basement" or new dimension

**Cytoskeleton and Consciousness:**
- Complex dynamic network in intracellular cytoplasm
- Ideally suited for information processing, involved in all cell functions
- Key to understanding brain/mind/computer triangle

**Historical Perspectives on Consciousness:**
- Various theories and metaphors of mind have evolved through the 20th century

**Particle/Wave Physics and Consciousness:**
- Great discoveries in particle physics dissolved solidity of matter into mathematical relationships
- Thoughts, feelings, introspection, mind-environment interactions related to brain as waves to electrons
- Essence of life and consciousness perceived as coordinated electron movement within semiconductive proteins or related to fundamental particle activities
- Questions: How, where, and at what level of organization?

### Consciousness as Particle/Wave Physics

**Brain/Mind/Computer Triangle**
- Basic irreducible substrate of information resides in biological cells
- Brain viewed as an organized assembly of billions of computers with emergent properties related to consciousness
- Hierarchy of brain organization has a "secret basement" - new dimension: cytoskeleton

**Cytoskeleton**
- Complex dynamic network within intracellular cytoplasm
- Parallel, highly interconnected solid state network of protein polymers
- Ideally suited for information processing and involved in all cell functions

**Historical Perspectives on Consciousness**
- Many disciplines have attempted to understand consciousness
- Each discipline's perception dependent on its orientation and contact with the "elephant" (mind)
- Progression of theories and metaphors of mind: matter, protoplasm, learning, metaphysical imposition, helpless spectator, emergent property, behavior, and activity within brain's reticular activating system

**Consciousness as Particle/Wave Physics**
- 19th century discoveries in particle physics dissolved matter into mathematical relationships in space
- Thoughts, feelings, introspection, and mind-environment interactions related to brain as waves to electrons
- Nobel biochemist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi saw essence of life and consciousness in coordinated electron movement within semiconductive proteins
- Russian physicists Pullman and Pullman compared life and consciousness with mobility of electrons within resonant bond orbitals
- Scottish biologist A. G. Cairns-Smith theorized that life developed from crystals of clay, allowing for shifting neighbor relationships and processing information
- Information represented as dynamic electron patterns in computers; questions remain about how, where, and at what level of organization in the brain

### Consciousness as a Property of Protoplasm

**Consciousness as a Property of Protoplasm**
- Some 19th century biologists saw consciousness as a fundamental property of all living things
- Belief that consciousness is related to irritability in smallest one-cell organisms (amoeba, paramecium)
- Observations led to application of human psychology to such behavior
- Accepted by Charles Darwin and E.B. Titchner, seen as rudimentary consciousness through evolution
- Effects of general anesthetic gases on protoplasmic streaming suggest common link between these activities and brain activities related to consciousness
- Protoplasmic streaming and other primitive organism movements depend on dynamic activities of cytoskeletal structures, including microtubules, actin, sol-gel transitions, and ciliary appendages (Chapter 5)
- **Jaynes' objections**: humans may be projecting their own mind functions onto protozoan behavior, which is in physical chemistry rather than introspective psychology
- If amoeba, slime mold, or paramecium are not conscious, when does consciousness emerge?

**Consciousness as Learning**
- Some believed that consciousness began at a specific time after life evolved and was directly related to learning
- Rationale: if an animal modifies its behavior based on experience, it must be having an experience and therefore must be conscious
- Equating learning, experience, and consciousness

### Consciousness as Learning

**Brain/Mind/Computer**
* **The Consciousness Debate:** Some 19th century biologists believed that consciousness is a fundamental property of all living things, particularly in small one-cell organisms like amoebas and paramecium
* **Protoplasmic Consciousness**: Belief that protoplasm, the living substance in cells, has properties related to human consciousness; supported by anesthetic effects on cytoskeletal structures
* **Critics of Protoplasmic Consciousness**: Jaynes argues humans may be projecting their own psychology onto primitive organisms, but introspective psychology is also chemical in nature
* **The Evolutionary Emergence of Consciousness:** Stanford Professor Karl Pribram's debate with Wilder Penfield about the difference between man and other animals; Pribram saw consciousness as a quantitative change leading to qualitative emergence
* **Consciousness as Learning**: Proponents believe that consciousness arises specifically related to learning, as animals modify their behavior through experience.

### Consciousness as a Metaphysical Imposition

**Brain/Mind/Computer: Consciousness Debate**

**1. Brain/Learning and Consciousness:**
- **Associative Memory**: models based on neural net computer simulations may be reinforced by historical emphasis on learning
- Learning is crucial for biological success
- Structural correlates of learning in mammalian brain involve synaptic strengthening through neuronal cytoskeleton reorganization
- Consciousness and learning are separate problems; AI systems can learn but lack consciousness
- Certain drugs block long term memory storage and retrieval, indicating consciousness is more than just learning

**2.2 Consciousness Debate:**
**1. Metaphysical Imposition Theory**:
- Evolutionary link between man and apes led to belief that consciousness cannot evolve naturally
- Founded by Alfred R. Wallace, co-discoverer of natural selection with Charles Darwin
- Sought explanation for consciousness through metaphysical force
- Discredited due to lack of proof; Darwin became known as discoverer of evolution
- Attempts to apply particle/wave physics to cell biology were also discredited
- Modern bioelectromagnetic field theories propose nanoscale activities within a cyto skeletal information system as potential explanation for consciousness, but remain undocumented
- Future nanotechnology may permit detection of these fields if they exist

**2. Helpless Spectator Theory:**
- Materialistic view suggesting that consciousness is an epiphenomenon to important biological activities
- Consciousness described as a "helpless spectator" of cosmic events
- Criticized for blurring the distinction between science, philosophy and religion

### The Helpless Spectator Theory

**Brain/Mind/Computer**

**Associative Memory and Consciousness**:
- Associative processes viewed as essential element of consciousness
- Models of associative memory in neural net computer simulations may be strengthened by historical glorification of learning
- Structural correlates of learning in mammalian brain involve dynamic reorganization of neuronal cytoskeleton to strengthen synapses
- Learning and consciousness are separate problems, as AI systems can learn but not be conscious
- Consciousness is more than just learning; information may be perceived but fail to be stored due to drugs or other factors

**Consciousness as a Metaphysical Imposition**:
- Evolutionary link between civilized man and apes led some to believe consciousness could not have evolved by natural selection
- Wallace founded the metaphysical imposition theory, which attributed consciousness to a metaphysical force outside the biological system
- Vitalists and spiritualists attempted to apply particle/wave physics to explain consciousness, but were discredited for lack of proof
- Modern bioelectromagnetic field theories remain undocumented, but could provide a possible explanation
- The metaphysical imposition theory remains speculation, but may provoke violent opposition to future development of artificial consciousness

**The Helpless Spectator Theory**:
- Materialistic view that suggests consciousness is an epiphenomenon to important biological activities
- Consciousness is like a helpless spectator observing cosmic events, with no control over biological processes

### Emergent Evolution

**Brain/Mind/Computer**
- The "helpless spectator" theory: conscious automata (Jaynes, 1976)
  - Contrast with cellular automata, which can process and compute independently
- William James rejected the helpless spectator theory
  - Intense consciousness occurs during hesitant action
  - Least conscious during habitual activities

**Emergent Evolution Theory**
- Reconciled metaphysical imposition view with collective emergent properties
- Consciousness emerged as a new property in evolution, underivable from its constituent parts (Jaynes, 1976)
- Properties of complex compounds and living things emerged from simpler ones
- Consciousness assumed control over the course of events in the brain and causal efficacy in bodily behavior
- Emergence of consciousness may be viewed as a nonlinear emergence from evolutionary events
- Liberated biologists and neuroscientists to deal with the mind subjectively, allowing for Freudian theory and psychiatry (beyond concrete physical properties)
- Significant questions: when did consciousness emerge? Where? In what species? What was it?
- The brain/mind duality still existed, with the mind dealt with only in broad and nebulous generalities.

**Behaviorism**
- Solved the problem of consciousness by ignoring it
- Traced roots to epcurians of 18th century and attempts to generalize plant tropisms to animal behavior
- Explained cognitive processes on reflexes and conditioned responses across various organisms
- Human behavior could be explained as reflex responses to given situations or needs to satisfy bodily functions.

### Behaviorism

**Brain/Mind/Computer Relationship:**

**Helpless Spectator Theory:**
- Consciousness compared to a bystander, unable to change course of events (Jaynes, 1976)
- Rejected by William James due to lack of explanation for heightened consciousness during hesitant actions or unconscious habits

**Emergent Evolution:**
- Consciousness emerged as a new property in evolution, not derivable from constituent parts (Jaynes, 1976)
- Mill and others proposed that emergence of complex compounds led to previously unseen relationships and new phenomena
- Consciousness assumed control over biological systems through nonlinear emergence from evolutionary events
- Liberated scientists from needing a concrete basis for concepts like ego, id, superego (Kanfer, 2017)
- Questions still remained: when did consciousness emerge? In what species? What is it?

**Behaviorism:**
- Solved problem of consciousness by ignoring it
- Traced roots to epicurians and reflex responses in animals and man
- Explained cognition as conditioned responses for satisfying bodily functions.

### Consciousness as Dynamic Activities of the Brain

**Behaviorism in Psychology**
* Behaviorism: method rather than a theory, dominated neuroscience for a significant period
* Attracted university positions, grant money
* Labs flourished in universities worldwide
* Operant paradigms: rat mazes and conditioned responses
* Failing: denial or ignoring consciousness
* Purged psychology to place it in mainstream of academic science

**Search for Consciousness in the Brain**
* Descartes proposed pineal gland as site of consciousness due to its uniqueness
* Logical conclusion: single site or region recognizes and assimilates all information, called "Mind's Eye" or "Grandfather neuron"
* Many researchers focused on reticular activating system (RAS) as neural substrate of consciousness

**Reticular Activating System (RAS)**
* Organized tangle of tiny interconnecting neurons extending from spinal cord to thalamus and hypothalamus
* Integrates collaterals from sensory and motor nerves, has direct lines to major cortex areas and brainstem nuclei, sends fibers down spinal cord
* Regulates activity and wakefulness of entire brain by sensitizing or desensitizing neurons and nervous centers
* Anesthetic drugs like sodium thiopental affect RAS, so do destructive lesions and electrical stimulation.

### Neural Net Connectionism

**Neural Net Connectionism and Brain/Mind/Computer Relationship**
- **Movement Fortified by Computer Scientists**: Efforts to mimic brain through artificial intelligence systems based on neural net models
- **Key Concept: Cell Assembly (Donald Hebb, 1949)**: Specially organized reverberatory circuits for thought elements, allowing strengthening of frequently used connections
- **Neural Net Models**: Large number constructed and simulated on computers; intelligence depends on richness of interconnections and nonlinear feedback
- **Advancements in Neural Net Theories**: Helped advance robotic and computer systems for artificial intelligence, provide insight into brain function
- **Shortcomings of Early Models**: Based on hypothetical neurons with huge assumptions; more recent models incorporate axonal impulses, synaptic delays, dendritic analog functions, spatial coherence
- **Neural Net Theories and Consciousness**: Suggest the brain forms prerepresentations of expected sensory input to select reality candidates; Changeux (1985) defines consciousness as a global regulatory system dealing with mental objects using neural net models.

### Holography - Cytoskeletal Basis of Consciousness

**Brain/Mind/Computer**

**Holography**:
- Holograms can be formed from interference patterns generated from two or more coherent wave sources
- Initially a laboratory curiosity, holography became important with the advent of lasers as coherent light sources in the early 1960s
- A hologram recorded in a photographic plate appears to be mere gibberish until reilluminated with one of the original coherent wave sources, at which point it projects three dimensional spatial images
- Two properties of holograms have attracted interest and comparisons with consciousness and mental imagery:
  - Holograms have an enormous capacity for information storage
  - The structure of neurons, with their vast arborizations of dendritic fibers accepting up to 100,000 synaptic inputs per neuron, indicates a very complex system
- Dendrites may be more than passive transmitters of impulses; they may have action potentials in large dendrites, slow depolarization waves in others, and the possibility of elementary logic operations at branching points

**Cytoskeleton Basis of Consciousness**:
- Classical approaches to understanding the brain/mind have assumed a hierarchy of organization with interneuronal synapses as the indivisible substrates of information transfer
- However, neurons are too complex to be simple digital switches or gates and must contain intrinsic information processing systems
- The **neuron** is often mistakenly described as a simple device that compares a weighted sum of dendritic analog input signals with some threshold level above which an output digital pulse is transmitted along an axon
- The structure of neurons, with their vast arborizations of dendritic fibers, indicates a very complex system
- Dendrites may not be passive transmitters; they may have action potentials in large dendrites, slow depolarization waves in others, and the possibility of elementary logic operations at branching points

### Origin and Evolution of Life

**Origin and Evolution of Life**

**Life's Defining Properties**:
- Living organisms have properties such as:
  - Growth
  - Reproduction
  - Dynamic, purposeful activities
  - (Higher organisms) Intelligence and consciousness
- Life forms are based on the same genetic blueprints (DNA, RNA) and building blocks (proteins)

**Theories of Life's Emergence**:

**Soup vs Mud**:
- Discusses the "place of origin" for life
- The "soup" hypothesis: Primordial soup of organic molecules in the earth's oceans
  - Proposed by A. I. Oparin and J. B. S. Haldane in the 1920s
  - Supported by experiments by Stanley L. Miller in the 1950s, detecting organic molecules relevant to living processes
- The "mud" hypothesis: Early organisms utilized pre-existing information templates in the form of wet clay crystals (Cairns-Smith)

**Chicken vs Egg**:
- Discusses the "molecular cause and effect" of life's emergence
- The "chicken vs egg" dilemma: Which came first, the organic molecules or the organisms?

**Other Candidates for Life's Origin**:
- Conditions above thermal vents on the ocean floor are believed to be conducive to the formation of organic compounds
- Organic precursors have been found in intrastellar dust, comets, and meteorites
- Some believe that primitive cells were transplanted to earth from space

### Soup vs Mud, Chicken vs Egg

**Origin and Evolution of Life: Soup vs Mud, Chicken vs Egg**

**What is Life?**:
- Living organisms possess properties like growth, reproduction, dynamic purposeful activities, intelligence, and consciousness
- All known life forms share the same genetic blueprints (DNA, RNA) and building blocks (proteins)
- Suggests a common ancestry

**Life's Molecular Emergence**:
- Lifes molecular emergence can be viewed in relation to two basic questions:
  - Place of origin (soup vs mud)
  - Molecular cause and effect (chicken vs egg)

**Primordial Soup Theory**:
- Russian biochemist A. I. Oparin (1938) and British biologist J. B. S. Haldane (1947):
  - Proposed a primordial soup of organic molecules in the earth's oceans, around 4 billion years ago
- Primordial atmosphere: unoxidized gases like methane, ammonia, and hydrogen
  - Similar to what exists on Jupiter
- Key experiment by Stanley L. Miller (early 1950s):
  - Created a closed environment with such a primitive atmosphere
  - Detected organic molecules relevant to living processes, including four amino acids and precursors of DNA and ribose sugars

**Other Sites for Life's Origin**:
- Conditions above thermal vents on the ocean floor are believed conducive to organic compound formation
- Thermal vents: home to strange and exotic life forms like giant tube worms
- Organic compounds found in intrastellar dust, comets, and meteorites
- Some believe that primitive cells were transplanted to earth from space

**Alternative Explanation**:
- A. Graham Cairns-Smith (1982) of Glasgow University suggests that early organisms utilized pre-existing information templates in the form of wet clay crystals (mud)

### Prokaryote to EukaryoteSymbiotic Jump

**Evolution of Life: From Prokaryotes to Eukaryotes**

**Prokaryote to Eukaryote**
* Changes in atmosphere and temperature due to prokaryotic bacteria
* Emergence of photosynthetic bacteria (purple and green) leading to oxygen production
* Toxic waste crisis: adaptations such as motility systems, detoxification, and oxygen breathing
* Early aerobic prokaryotes flourished for a few hundred million years
* Eukaryotic cells emerged about 2 billion years ago
* Characteristics of eukaryotic cells: organized cell interiors with separate membrane-enclosed compartments (nuclei), chromosomes, mitochondria, and chloroplats

**Origin of Eukaryotes**
* Sudden appearance in fossil records without apparent intermediate forms
* Symbiotic association theories proposed by Marishkowski (1905) and Wallen (1922)
+ Union of primitive monera and more advanced cocci, resulting in stable symbiosis
+ Nuclear material became the cytoplasm, and monera became the host cell
* Endosymbiotic theory introduced by Lynn Sagan (Margulis) in 1967
+ Series of three symbiotic events leading to the first eukaryotes
- Ingestion of an aerobic heterotroph by an anaerobic heterotroph, resulting in mitochondria
- Ingestion of a spirochete (motile organism) becoming an intracellular organelle.

**Mysterious Evolutionary Chasm**
- Fossil records show sudden appearance of eukaryotes without intermediate forms
- Symbiosis theories propose that eukaryotes resulted from unions between different types of prokaryotes, leading to the development of specialized organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.

### CentriolesEvolutions Hijackers - Biotech EvolutionThe Next Symbiosis

**Origin and Evolution of Life**

**Centrioles**:
- Appearance of centrioles and related cytoskeletal structures around 1 billion years ago may have contributed to eukaryote success and the lineage leading to human consciousness
- Centrioles are composed of two similar cylinders (centrioles), each with a diameter of 0.2 microns (200 nanometers) and radial symmetry
- Centrioles trigger and guide major cell reorganizations during mitosis, growth, and differentiation
- Perpendicular replication of centriole centers (MTOCs) initiates mitosis, a mystery compared to longitudinal replication or fission

**Biotech Evolution: The Next Symbiosis**:
- Technological evolution may lead to another acceleration in biological evolution, as eukaryotes have dealt with crises such as toxic oxygen two billion years ago and developed new forms and energies
- **Samuel Butler**: 19th century scientist/satirist who considered the possibility of machines suppressing humans and assuming supremacy on earth
- **Platt**: General systems theorist who believes Earth's life may be nearing an important evolutionary turning point, with a collective social nervous system managing millions of problems
- Possible new technologies may help biology deal with current and future crises

**Microcosmos: 4 Billion Years of Evolution from our Microbial Ancestors**:
- Current humans are little more than communities of bacteria, nucleated cells, and other modular manifestations
- New artificial life forms may emerge from symbiotic fusion of biology and technology:
  - Genetic biotechnology
  - Computer robotics
  - Biochips

### From Brain to Cytoskeleton

**From Brain to Cytoskeleton**

- Nietzsche's metaphor of leech as a universe in its own right
- Human brain evolved from earthworms and leeches with ganglion chains
- Primitive nervous systems consisted of paired, symmetrically paired ganglia
  - Polarity and orientation defined by cytoskeleton within neurons
- Head ganglion began to dominate other members through cooperation
  - Segmented organism to centralized system: encephalization
- Transition from segmented organism to central nervous system occurred over eons
  - Fusion of paired chains of ganglia into a tubelike structure

**Nietzsche's Perspective**:
- Pursue the leech to its last rock bottom, as a scientist
- Mastery of brain of the leech is one's field

**Primitive Nervous Systems**:
- Consisted of chains of organized nerve cell clusters (ganglia)
- Paired ganglion chains resemble autonomic nervous systems in vertebrates
- Transition to a centralized nervous system occurred through fusion and growth of ganglia

**Encephalization**:

```

**Brain Organization**:

- Essential elements:
  * Neuronal orientation and asymmetry determined by cytoskeleton within higher plant and animal cells
  * Nervous system evolution from segmented organisms to centralized systems (encephalization)

### Nervous System Organization

**Nervous System Evolution and Organization**

**Background:**
- German philosopher Nietzsche's analogy: human brain to universe of leech
- Brain evolved from simple nervous systems of earthworms and leeches

**Early Nervous Systems:**
1. Consisted of chains of organized clumps of nerve cells (ganglia)
2. Polarity and preferred axis determined by neuronal orientation
3. Primitive leech's head ganglion dominated other members, performed decisions
4. Segmented organism to nervous system: fusion of paired chains into a tubelike structure
5. Paired nerve roots connected central nervous system with peripheral organs

**Transition and Encephalization:**
1. Head end increased in size and importance (dominance)
2. Process of hierarchy formation in parallel, distributed system: encephalization
3. Older components (e.g., neocortex) more highly organized, capable of complex functions

**Nervous System Organization:**
1. Brain activities studied by various disciplines for centuries
2. Essential elements described in following sections

### Architecture

**Cytoskeleton as an Information Processing Medium in Brain Neurons**

**Background**:
- Purpose: justify that the cytoskeleton is an underlying medium of information processing within brain neurons
- Architecture:
  - Central Nervous System (CNS): organized in an ascending hierarchy of parallel structures: spinal cord, brain stem, and brain
  - Peripheral Nervous System: peripheral nerves and the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system
  - Human brains contain about a hundred billion neurons
  - Evolution caused a cephalic shift towards higher centers in man's CNS
  - Generalized similarities in structure, composition, and functioning of central nervous systems in all vertebrates
  - Neurons within all nervous systems are organized by their component cytoskeletons

**Brain/Mind Concepts**:
- **Consciousness, self, Mind's Eye, attention**
- **Brain Systems, Homunculi, Centers:** functionally related neurons, anatomical regions, assemblies of networks, reverberation

**Neural Synaptic Networks**:
- Cooperativity due to dense interconnectedness, parallelism, associative memory, learning, synaptic plasticity
- **Neuron:** multiple synaptic inputs and outputs, dendritic processing, synaptic plasticity, axoplasmic transport

**Cytoskeleton**:
- **Centrioles, microtubules, filaments:** synaptic morphology, spatiotemporal cellular organization, coherent oscillations
- **Cytoplasmic Ground Substance (Infoplasm)**: sol-gel states, geodesic actin, tensegrity structures, ordered water, dissipative patterns, holographic interference

**Table 4-1: Collective Hierarchy of Parallel Information Processing Systems**
- Two types of cells in nervous tissue: neurons and satellite cells
- In the central nervous system, the satellite cells are called neuroglia; in the periphery, Schwann cells
- White matter of the central nervous system consists of fiber tracts and their myelinating glial cells

### Neuronal Signaling

**Brain Functional Organization**
- Brain functional organization: clumps of neural cells and dendrites called nuclei (Figure 4.2)

**Neuronal Signaling**
- Electrical potential changes produced by ionic currents at nerve cell membranes
- Ions involved: sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride
- Neuron maintains electrical polarization through active pumping of ions
- Opening of membrane protein channels allows rapid flow of ions, creating depolarization
- Depolarization results in waves used as signals (localized gated potentials or propagating action potentials)

**Localized Gated Potentials**
- Older on the evolutionary scale
- Spread only one to two millimeters, attenuated and distorted by local resistivity
- Essential for spatial and temporal summation (integration) at sensory nerve endings, neuronal synaptic junctions, and slow waves in dendrites

**Action Potentials (Nerve Impulses)**
- Membrane depolarization waves along axons due to sequential opening of membrane channels
- Gaps in myelinization (nodes of Ranvier) contain abundant ion channels for rapid impulse propagation
- Fixed velocity dependent on axon diameter, degree of myelinization, and distribution of ion channels
- Typical velocities of about 100 meters per second allow effective communication within large nervous systems

**Interneuronal Synapses**
- Action potentials and axons terminate at synaptic connections with other neurons or effector cells
- Final branch portions of axons have thin, swollen terminals called boutons
- Synapses form between axon terminal and another neuron's dendrite
- Two modes of synaptic signaling: electrical and chemical
  - At electrical synapses, currents generated by an impulse spread directly to the next neuron through low resistance channels.

### Interneuronal Synapses

**Neuronal Signaling and Interneuronal Synapses**

**Brain Structure**:
- Gray matter refers to clusters of nerve cells and dendrites, known as nuclei
- Schematic diagram of brain functional organization (Figure 4.2)

**Neuronal Signaling**:
- Signals consist of electrical potential changes due to ionic currents
- Nerve maintains an electrical polarization by pumping sodium ions out and potassium ions in
- When channels are opened, rapid flow of sodium and potassium creates depolarization
- Depending on location and timing, activation can result in waves as signals
- Neurons carry localized gated potentials (older, analog) and propagating action potentials (newer, digital)

**Localized Gated Potentials**:
- Spread only 1-2mm, attenuated by local resistivity
- Integration of spatial and temporal summation required in sensory nerve endings, neuronal synaptic junctions, and slow waves in dendrites
- Dendritic potentials allow cerebral neurons to "whisper together"

**Action Potentials (Nerve Impulses)**:
- Propagate as membrane depolarization waves along axons
- Occur due to sequential opening of ion channels, allowing passive diffusion of ions
- Gaps in myelinization contain abundant ion channels for rapid propagation between nodes
- Action potentials occur on an all-or-none basis (digital) from integration of analog dendritic input at the cell body
- Typical action potential velocities of about 100 meters per second allow effective communication in large nervous systems

**Interneuronal Synapses**:
- Action potentials and axon terminals connect with other neurons or effector cells
- Final branch portions of axons have thin, swollen synaptic terminals (boutons)
- Synapses form between axon terminal and dendrite of another neuron, although other types also occur
- Two modes of synaptic signaling: electrical and chemical

### Representation of Information

**From Brain to Cytoskeleton**

**Neuron Function:**
- Releases neurotransmitters at junctions with other neurons or muscles
- Miniature end plate potentials below threshold for depolarization of postsynaptic cell
- Specific binding of neurotransmitter molecules to receptors changes membrane permeability
- Integration of local receptor potentials spatially and temporally to exceed threshold, causing signals in post synaptic dendrite, cell body, or axon

**Excitatory vs. Inhibitory:**
- Excitation: increases permeability to sodium and potassium (acetylcholine at neuromuscular junction)
- Inhibition: increase in chloride ion permeability (GABA), prevents release of neurotransmitter pre-synaptically

**Synapse Function:**
- Computation of output from multiple inputs
- Influence on each other by excitation or inhibition, lateral inhibition sharpens or focuses

**Neuron Integration:**
- Receives many excitatory and inhibitory inputs (convergence)
- Supplies many others (divergence)
- Integrates synaptic inputs to determine output

**Integration Complexity:**
- Multiple levels of processing: dendritic branch points, spines, active nodes between myelin sheaths, changes in synaptic efficacy

**Neuron as a Computer:**
- Complexity at individual neuron level
- Cytoskeleton is nervous system within the nervous system

**Brain Information Processing:**
- Enigma: understanding information representation within nervous systems
- Benefits to neuroscience, computer science (AI)
- Underlying assumption: parallel networks of connected units with neurons and synaptic connections as fundamental substrates

**Analog Processing:**
- Neurons perform significant analog processing at dendrite level and cytoskeleton
- Modification of synaptic transmission threshold regulated by cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic connections.

### IntegrationSherringtons Reflex Centers

**Neural Centers and Integration**

**Background:**
- Sherrington's discovery of integration in reflex centers (1930s)
- Brain faces decision based on diverse information
- Importance of integration at all levels and types of organisms
- Concept of neural centers: groups of neurons performing specific functions
  - Nucleus: compact region of gray matter, contains high density of neuronal cell bodies and synapses
  - White matter: high density of cable-like axon fibers
  - Difference between anatomic regions and brain-wide distribution of information

**Sherrington's Research:**
- Recorded muscle tension through stretch reflex
- Proposed neural masses or reflex centers
- Functional while nuclei are structural

**Integration:**
- Occurs at all levels of nervous systems
- Takes various types of information into account and assigns priorities
- Global example: fight or flight decision

**Neural Centers:**
- Assemblies of neurons performing specific functions
- Can coincide with nuclei but not always the case
- Conveys erroneous impression of anatomically specific function
- Denotes groups of neurons whose destruction leads to loss of specific function and/or stimulation evokes certain behavioral or physiological response.

**Brain Functions:**
- Not divided among centers in the same way as a large organization or factory
- Perplexing relation between anatomic regions devoted to specific functions and brain-wide distribution of information.

**Examples of Integration:**
- Satiety center: located in hypothalamus, regulates feeding behavior by integrating multiple inputs for binary output (eat or don't eat)
- Body representations like motor and sensory homunculi integrate wide sources of distributed input to anatomical sensation and action.

### Pulse Logic

**Sherrington's Contribution to Neuroscience**
- Sherrington illuminated information processing by neural structures through **integration by reflex centers**
- Discovered that information transfer functions occur at all levels of nervous system organization
- Included functions used in computers such as **summation**, **ramp triggers**, **analog/digital conversion**, and **logic**

**Pulse Logic in Neural Signaling**
- **Electrical signaling in the nervous system**: discovered by Galvani during 18th century demonstration with a frog
- **Galvani's findings**: animals generate their own electrical currents, not just responding to applied electricity
- **Development of microelectrode and electronic equipment** (1940s) revealed **discrete electrical nerve impulses** throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems
- **Electrophysiological techniques**: used to record activity of individual cells, study neural events in perception of touch
- **Neural activity signals**: brief electrical pulses about 0.1 volt, last for approximately one millisecond, move at up to 120 meters per second
- **Synaptic delay** is the significant delay within the nervous system
- **McCulloch and Pitts' proposal** (1943): neurons can be approximated as all-or-none processes with a threshold number of excited input synapses to excite the neuron's output
- **Pulse logic**: relatively new compared to graded wave-like events in more primitive nerve nets
- **Information transfer and processing basis**: not solely based on nerve impulses; McCulloch considered other substrates.

### Connectionism and Neural Networks

**The Emergence of Connectionism and Neural Networks in Information Processing**

**Background:**
- McCulloch's quest for a logical unit in nervous impulses (1950s)
- Adrian's discovery of frequency coding in nerve cells (1947)
- Limitations of frequency coding as qualitative information
- Importance of connections: significance determined by origins and destinations of nerve fibers
- Development of connectionism through neural networks

**Early Discoveries:**
- Camillo Golgi's method for staining neurons (1875)
- Santiago Ramon y Cajal's investigations into mammalian nervous systems (1890s-1950s)
  - Resolved question of nerves as separate entities or part of a network
  - Demonstrated complex connections among neurons are highly selective and specific.

**Development of Connectionism:**
- McCulloch and Pitts model (1943)
  * Added terms for dendritic memory and circular neural networks
  * Pulse logic evolved into connectionism as a medium of neural information representation
- Predecessors: Morse code comparison, frequency coding limitations.

**Key Insights:**
- Information processing at the level of cytoskeletal proteins and their dynamic activity
- Significance attributed to origins and destinations of nerve fibers (connectionism)
- Neural representation through nonvisual stimulation or phantom limb phenomenon.

### Distributedness

**Neural Networks and Connectionism**

**Darwin-Wallace Theory**:
- Recognition automata operating in dynamic cytoskeletal networks within neurons
- Lateral communicating networks between Darwin and Wallace resolve conflicting output, forming associative memory
- Selectionist approach

**Neuroanatomical Appreciation of Synaptic Structure**:
- Connectionist theory credited to neuroanatomy of synaptic structure
- Hebb extended theory to memory and behavior in humans

**Lashley's Experiments on Memory Representation**:
- Distributed throughout the brain, not localized to specific areas
- Ablation experiments showed that memory function is disrupted in proportion to amount of cortex destroyed
- Lashley proposed that recall can be evoked in many sets of neurons and places in regions related to memory

**Lashley's Alternative Theory**:
- Rejected localized storage of memory traces attached to spatially fixed reflex pathways
- Suggested that the pattern representing a memory could be evoked anywhere in regions of the brain involved with memory function
- Explained by Lashley as excitatory patterns in cortex related to spread of interference patterns on surface of a liquid disturbed at several points

**Hebb's Comments**:
- Lashley concluded that a learned discrimination is not based on excitation of any particular nerve cells
- Suggested the neural change induced by experience and constituting memory may not be a change of

### Synaptic Mechanisms of Learning and Memory - Axoplasmic Transport

**Brain to Cytoskeleton**

**4.3.5 Synaptic Mechanisms of Learning and Memory:**
- Traditional memory classes: short term vs long term
  - Short term memory (working memory): small capacity, labile, easily disrupted
    - Used for remembering telephone numbers until dialed
    - Transition to long term memory through consolidation process
  - Long term memory (reference memory): large capacity, enduring for a long time
    - Well-practiced access routes: mnemonics or reference clues
    - Items not used become increasingly difficult to recall
- Consolidation: important short term memory mechanism and link between cytoskeleton and neural networks
- Axoplasmic transport: another link maintaining form and functions of neuronal structures through axon/dendrite

**4.3.6 Axoplasmic Transport:**
- Neurons manufacture materials in cell bodies, moved to nerve terminals by axoplasmic transport
  - Synaptic membrane proteins, cytoskeletal protein structures, organelles, and enzymes
- Fastest processes move at 400 millimeters per day (500 nanometers/sec), slowest barely 1 millimeter per day
- Mechanical parts: microtubules and contractile proteins (dynein or kinesin) using ATP hydrolysis for activity
- Axoplasmic transport flows in different directions depending on nerve type: anterograde and retrograde.

**Anterograde Axoplasmic Flow:**
- From cell body to nerve terminal in motor nerves, primary sensory neurons, and dendrites

**Retrograde Axoplasmic Flow:**
- Toward the cell body, bringing feedback information for regulating production of transmitter enzymes and other materials. It may also return worn or broken down cell constituents to be recycled.

### Parallelism, Collective Cooperativity, and the Grain of the Engram

**Parallelism, Collective Cooperativity, and the Grain of the Engram**

**Comparison between Brain and Modern Computers**:
- Neuron-to-neuron synapses operate on the order of milliseconds
- The brain can perform processing feats that are impossible for modern computers
- Assumption is that the brain accomplishes this through parallel operation of many components

**Parallel, Distributed Models of Collective Mind Organization**:
- Michael Gazzaniga's research with split-brain patients:
  - Minds consist of large collections of smaller, semiautonomous parts
  - Organized into relatively independent functioning units that work in parallel
  - Modules include:
    - Face and visual image recognition
    - Language interpretation
    - Inference engine located in dominant hemisphere to coordinate consciousness
- **Gazzaniga's notion of free will**:
  - We are continually interpreting behaviors of independent brain modules as our own
  - This can be compared to the parallel connectionist concept, which requires a vote or caucus to determine a summary output
- Gazzaniga's view is that basic cognitive phenomena such as acquiring and holding social beliefs are a product of human brain organization
- Marvin Minsky's view in **The Society of Mind**:
  - The mind is a vast network of agents, with information represented by frames and connected knowledge nodes
  - This represents a more complex grid of agents than Gazzaniga's modules, but similar to neural network theory

**Questions Remain**:
- Where is the grain of consciousness?
- Is the mind more than an array of squabbling modules?

### Toward Molecular Consciousness

**John's Perspective on Consciousness (1980)**
- Consciousness is a property of "improbable distributions of energy in space and time"
- Similar to gravity as a property of matter

**Neuronal Structure Modification and Memory Formation**
- Wave patterns modify neuronal structure, forming memories for later resonances
- Rapid changes in chemical state required for simultaneous recognition by neural elements

**Candidates for Neuronal Structures Suitable for Cognitive Content Representation**
- Large numbers of neural elements require rapid changes in chemical state of widely distributed macromolecules
- Allosteric proteins, which can transduce regulatory signals to undergo functional conformational changes, are likely candidates

**Protein Conformation and Function Coupling with EEG Waves**
- Hyden (1977) proposed proteins change conformation in response to weak, oscillating electric fields
- Adey (1977): neural protein conformation and function coupled with EEG waves
  - Hydrated glycoproteins, membrane proteins, and cytoskeleton primed for rapid conformational changes
  - Transduction of electromagnetic energy into conformational states by widely distributed proteins can cooperatively represent dynamic information

**Molecular Network Adapted to Information Processing**
- Biological intelligence's "common thread" or "engram" found within the cooperative dynamics of a molecular network
- Structure and functions of cytoskeleton appear perfectly adapted to information processing.

### Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer

**Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer**

**Living Organisms**:
- Collection of organized assemblies called protoplasm
- Protoplasm consists of:
  - Membranes
  - Organelles
  - Nuclei
  - Cytoplasm (bulk interior medium)

**Dynamic Rearrangements of Cytoplasm**:
- Account for changing shape, positioning of organelles, and movement in eukaryotic cells
- Cytoskeleton, a network of filamentous proteins, is responsible for cytoplasmic organization

**Historical Context**:
- Early 19th century: Felix Du Jardin proposed all cells were composed of a material called **sarcode**, with both structural and contractile properties
- Late 19th century: Dutch microscopist van Leeuwenhoek observed red blood cells deforming and returning to shape, demonstrating the elasticity of cytoplasm
- Cytoplasmic architecture and contractility could not be explained by purely chemical or physical properties alone
- Early 20th century: Two competing theories emerged:
  - **Reticular theory**: Continuous reticular network of delicate fibrils extending through the cell
  - **Fibrillar theory**: Unbranched, discontinuous fibrils forming the cytoplasmic substratum

**Evolution of Understanding**:
- Both theories were initially supported but later deflated by microscope preparation techniques arising between 1870 and 1890
- Fibrillar and reticular frameworks appeared in many fixed cells, particularly in muscle, nerve, cartilage, and epithelial cells.

### The Nature of Cytoplasm

**Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer**
- Living organisms are composed of assemblies of cells containing protoplasm
- Protoplasm consists of membranes, organelles, nuclei, and cytoplasm (bulk interior medium)
- Dynamic rearrangements of cytoplasm account for cell shape changes, organelle positions, and movement
- **Cytoskeleton**: Dynamic network of filamentous proteins responsible for cytoplasmic organization

**History of Cytoplasm Study**
- Early observations: Felix Du Jardin (1835), E. Brucke (1861)
- Observations on cell elasticity and structure led to theories of a fibrous or reticular substratum in cytoplasm
  - Reticular theory: continuous network of delicate fibrils
  - Fibrillar theory: unbranched, discontinuous fibrils
- Microscope preparation techniques between 1870 and 1890 revealed both frameworks in various cells

**Actin Subunits and Gel States**
* Protein actin subunits polymerize in various forms: interlacing gels, filamentous bundles
* Cytoplasmic gel states occur due to crosslinking of actin filaments and other proteins
* Can be converted to more aqueous sol states by calcium ions and other factors

**Early Electron Microscopy Limitations**

* Delicate tubular structures found to be present in virtually all cell types (microtubules)
* Bundles of microtubules correspond to birefringent fibers seen in living cells
* Recognized as household organelles after initial skepticism
* Subsequent characterization of actin, intermediate filaments, microtrabecular lattice or ground substance, and cen trioles led to recognition that cells are comprised of dynamic networks of connecting filaments

**Microtubules Function and Structure**
* Hollow cylinders about 25 nanometers in diameter
* Polymerized arrays of protein subunits with lengths ranging from tens of nanometers during early assembly to possibly meters in nerve axons.

### Microtubule Structure and Function

**Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer**

**Brush Heap Theory**:
- Seifriz proposed that cytoplasmic fibers could exist in "brush heap" form or form lateral associations by hydrogen bonding into paracrystalline aggregates
- Switching between these states accounted for observed cytoplasmic behavior in living cells

**Actin and Cytoskeletal Proteins**:
- Subunits of the protein actin can polymerize in various forms, including interlacing gels or filamentous bundles
- Cytoplasmic gel states occur due to crosslinking of actin filaments and other cytoskeletal proteins
- These gel states can be converted to more aqueous sol states by calcium ions and other factors

**Electron Microscope Discoveries**:
- Initial electron microscope use did not illuminate the substructure of cytoplasm
- Portions of cells that were optically empty by light microscopy appeared as fine tubular filaments with the electron microscope
- These filamentous structures were prominent in the mitotic apparatus and dendrites of neurons
- Fixative used for electron microscopy, osmium tetroxide, had been dissolving filamentous elements, delaying recognition of the cytoskeleton

**Microtubules**:
- With the advent of glutaraldehyde fixation, delicate tubular structures were found to be present in virtually all cell types
- Bundles of microtubules, corresponding to birefringent fibers seen with light microscopy, became generally accepted as "household organelles" in many cells
- Characterization of actin, intermediate filaments, and other cytoskeletal structures led to the recognition that cells were comprised of dynamic networks of connecting filaments

**Microtubule Structure and Function**:
- Microtubules (MT) are hollow cylinders about 25 nanometers in diameter
- Their lengths may range from tens of nanometers during early assembly to possibly meters in nerve axons
- They are involved in various important cell functions, including:
  - When required, microtubules assemble in the appropriate part of the cell with the necessary orientation
  - As microtubules are no longer needed, they depolymerize

**Comparative Functions of Microtubules**:
- Essential functions in cells ranging from single-cell amoebas to neurons in earthworms and Nobel scholars are performed by similar cytoskeletal structures

### Microtubule Assembly and the Generation of Form - Microtubule Organizing Centers (MTOC) and Centrioles

**Microtubules (MT)**
- Play vital role in biological growth and development
- Transduce mechanical force into nervous system through sensory cilia
- Act as engines driven backwards during mechanoreceptor function
- Intelligent activities include: conformational changes, guidance, alignment, secretion, synapse formation
- Two mechanisms of pattern formation: directed assembly from MT Organizing Centers (MTOC) and self assembly of multitubular arrays by means of intertubule linkers
- Scaffolding, conveyor belts, and computers in living cells

**MT Assembly and Generation of Form**
- Can assemble into rigid tubular rods when needed, disassemble into subunits
- Self assemble from subunits into orderly polymers
- Increase in order during MT assembly related to dispersal (disordering) of structured water

**MT Reorganization and Cytoskeleton Dynamics**
- Peripheral signals can lead to reorganization deep in the cell via MTOC or direct MT distribution change
- Cellular array is dynamic, requiring transient stabilization of certain MT configurations
- Proposed models: relay signal through cytoskeleton to MTOC for change, or affect MT distribution directly

**Microtubule Organizing Centers (MTOC) and Centrioles**
- Trigger and guide reorganization during growth, development, and cell movement
- Determine where, when, and how functions occur
- Contain centrioles as common structure in all control centers
- Composed of two similar cylinders with 9 radial symmetries, each constructed of 9 triplets of microtubules
- Centriole mechanisms of perpendicular replication, orientation, and guidance unknown.

### Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs)

  - Involved in orientation, shape, timing of division and growth
  - Determine what cells do, when and how they do it, and what kind of cells they are
  - Are MTOC the command centers of the cytoskeleton?
    - Centrioles rotate with a gyroscopic inertia to establish cell orientation
    - Communicate with actin filament networks to regulate cellular activities
    - Proposed to detect signals (e.g., infra-red, ultrasound) propagating linearly through the cytoplasm
  - May have technological applications in the future
- **Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs)**
  - Facilitate full range of MT functions
  - Include electromechanical enzymes, communicative crossbridges to other filaments/organelles, and MAPs that enhance MT assembly
  - Attachment patterns of MAPs to MT lattice walls have precise geometrical configurations related to their function
  - Example: Smooth passage of vesicles in axoplasmic transport is facilitated by specific MAPs

- Actin is most versatile component
- Creates transient configurations for specific purposes (contractile rings, probing lamellipodia)
- Ground floor of organization explored through microtrabecular lattice (MTL), cytomatrix, and cytoplasmic solid state

**5.4 The Cytoplasmic Ground Substance: Microtrabecular Lattice (MTL)**
- New techniques in high voltage electron microscopy at University of Colorado Boulder
- Observation of a three dimensional lattice of slender strands throughout cytoplasm
- Interlinked filaments suspend various cell systems and larger elements
- Named microtrabecular lattice (MTL) due to trabecular structure similarity with spongy bone

### The Microtrabecular Lattice (MTL)

**Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer (105): Actin and Neurofilament Gel**
- **Actin/Neurofilament gel (microtrabecular lattice)**
  - Fine texture of cytoplasmic organization
  - Smaller, more delicate structures branch and interconnect in gel state networks
  - Comprises the substance of living material
- **Three distinct cytoskeletal component systems:** MT, IF, actin filaments
- **Actin** is the most versatile component:
  - Polymerizes into string-like filaments
  - Forms dynamic branching nanoscale meshworks or geodesic polyhedrons
  - Assembly creates transient configurations for specific purposes
- **Ground Substance (cytoplasmic ground state)**
  - MT and IF are not the finest texture of cytoplasmic organization

### The Cytomatrix

**Cytoskeleton and Cytocomputer:**
- Controlled by MTL (Microtubule-associated proteins) through specific cytoskeletal linkages
- Regulates distribution of organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum in axons, Golgi apparatus placement, and synaptic bouton composition
- Mediates embryological development or morphogenesis via hormone receptors or tissue factors
- Transduces chemical or mechanical work for intracellular transport processes like axoplasmic transport and vesicle translocation
- MTL regulates cytoskeleton and cell at large, serving as dynamic ground substance

**MTL:**
- Labile and transient level of organization in cytoskeleton
- Microfrontier of living material organization
- Network within a network of cytoskeletal proteins
- In Chapter 8: represents standing wave patterns of calcium coupled sol-gel states from dynamic excitations of the cytoskeleton
- Potential bottom level in an information hierarchy called infoplasm

**Cytomatrix:**
- Protein makeup and functional organization of MTL (Microtubule-associated proteins)
- Peter Satir's research at Albert Einstein University on protein interactions within the cytoskeleton
- Primary building block: actin protein, versatile with various actin-binding proteins to unleash its capabilities
- Forms rigid bundles for structural support through interaction with fimbrin and myosin (mechanoenzyme)
- Connections between the cytomatrix and membrane proteins established by talin, spectrin, vinculin, ankyrin, and fodrin
- Calmodulin mediates effects of calcium ion fluxes on the cytomatrix
- Proteins like alpha actinin, troponin, filamin link actin networks, causing a gelatinous consistency in cytoplasm (gel)
- Continuous gel state below cell membranes; dynamic transitions can occur elsewhere.

### Cytoplasmic Solid State - Cytoskeletal Motility

**Components of Cytomatrix and Their Role in Cell Movement**

**Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer**:
- Actin filaments can undergo contraction and streaming, important for amoeboid locomotion
- Myosin appears to pull actin filaments against each other
- Rise in calcium ion causes actin networks to fragment, allowing myosin to pull actin filaments together, resulting in gel contraction and vigorous streaming

**Cytomatrix Structures**:
- Give rise to amoeboid and other types of cytoplasmic movement
- Calcium-mediated sol-gel transition and gel contraction can be important for cell functions like memory in neurons

**Cytoplasmic Solid State**:
- Molecules such as proteins and RNA are heterogeneously distributed, passively flow at rates below normal diffusion
- Actively transported molecules travel at velocities far exceeding diffusion
- Dynamic activity within the MTL can regulate enzymatic activity

**Cytoskeletal Motility**:
- Cell movement is determined by a "chemical computer" whose nature is not yet understood
- Various cytoplasmic movements include amoeboid creeping, internal streaming, axoplasmic transport, muscle contraction, ciliary and flagellar bending, and cell shape changes
- These maneuvers are engineered by a small group of proteins with spectacular collective effects.

### Cytoplasmic Probing

**Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer**

**Function of White Blood Cells**:
- Lymphocytes and macrophages are white blood cells that combat infection by:
  - Migrating from the blood stream into an open wound to engulf invading bacteria or foreign material

**Complex Cellular Movements**:
- Developing embryos perform precisely choreographed movements that give rise to different tissues
- Internal movement, such as the streaming of cytoplasm, secretion of cell product vesicles (neurotransmitters), engulfment of matter, and separation of paired chromosomes in cell division are routine functions whose complexity, organization, and precision generally boggle biologists
- Well controlled muscle contraction which depends on the conformational bending of myosin head molecules can result in strenuously running a 4-minute mile or delicately painting a Mona Lisa

**Categories of Cytoplasmic Movement and Force Generation**:
- **Cytoplasmic probing**
- **Bending sidearms** (e.g., lamellipodia)
- **Ciliary and collective movements**
- **Geodesic tensegrity structures**

**Cytoplasmic Probing**:
- W. H. Lewis, an embryologist at Carnegie Institute, studied the behavior of fibroblasts (active cells that repair wounds)
- After breaking up adhesive contacts and networks in the extracellular material, Lewis observed lamellipodia, delicate sheet-like extensions of the cytoplasm along the shortest side of the polygonal cell
- The ruffled lamellae slowly bend back and forth like a dress in a slight breeze
- Ingram and Abercrombie at University College London studied the membrane-coated ruffled lamellipodium, the main locomotion organ of fibroblasts
- Lamellipodia form strings and contact the substrate, stretching portions of the rest of the cell among temporary adhesions
- When a ruffle does not stick and the cell moves in another direction, the ruffle folds back on the upper surface of the cell, collapses onto it, and disappears into the cell

### Bending Sidearms

**Cytoskeleton and Cytoplasmic Intelligence**
- Cell exhibits migration behavior despite removal of neurons
- **Intelligence in cytoplasm**: cell has a "driver's license"

**Bending Sidearms (Contractile Proteins)**
- Important cytoplasmic movements due to bending of contractile proteins attached to cytoskeletal filaments
- In muscle, thin actin filaments interdigitate with thick myosin filaments
- Tiny sidearms or crossbridges (myosin heads) attach to myosin thick filaments and cycle like oars to move the filaments relative to each other
- ATP hydrolysis drives conformational changes in myosin molecules, causing contractility

**Myosin Filament and Myosin Head Rowing**
- Each myosin filament carries about 500 heads
- Myosin head rowing is initiated and coordinated by waves of calcium ion released from sarcoplasmic reticulum triggered by membrane electrical activity
- Precise use of ATP hydrolysis energy to cause contractility and conformational changes remains poorly understood

**MT Related Activities Generating Force, Locomotion, and Movement**
- Many MT related activities generate force, locomotion, and movement of vesicles and other material
- Axoplasmic transport is an example of this (Lasek, 1981; Ochs, 1982)
- Parallel MT within axons are polarized with their fast growing plus-ends distal from the cell body facing the synapse
- Contractile sidearms occur every 1618 nanometers along MT lengths and generate directional movement of material by undergoing a sequence of conformational changes involving attachment to vesicles, ATP dependent force generation, and detachment from vesicles

**MT Based Dynein Activities vs. Muscle Contractility**
- DTN based dynein activities are more variable, flexible, and interactive than repetitive nanoscale events in muscle
- Different material is simultaneously transported in opposite directions (retrograde axoplasmic transport) to provide feedback for protein synthesis or recycling of molecules

**Gliding MT Segments as Intracellular Conveyor Belts**
- Robert Allen and colleagues studied isolated MT fragments that glided along glass cover slips at velocities of 150 to 450 nanometers per second
- Velocity is independent of fragment length, occurs in a straight path, and is in the direction of retrograde axoplasmic transport
- Gliding MT segments suggest force generating enzymes are deployed in linear paths along the MT, and stroke causing gliding is parallel to the MT with a spacing interval of about 17 nanometers
- Reducing available ATP concentration slows gliding speed but does not affect number or behavior of gliding MT
- Gliding MT almost never interact when crossing paths; if forward progress is blocked, it fishtails slowly from side to side.

### Ciliary and Collective Movement - Geodesic Tensegrity Gels

**Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer: Ciliary and Collective Movement (5.5.3)**
* Structure of cilia and flagella: parallel microtubules in a cylindrical 9+2 arrangement, similar to centrioles but without central pair; actin wound around central pair
* Composed of dynein, the contractile protein that utilizes ATP energy for force production
* Function: move fluid or propel single cells through fluids; used for food collection and locomotion in single cell organisms
* Cilia continue to propagate normal bending movements when severed from cells with ATP, magnesium or calcium ions present
* Coordinated unidirectional waves of movement: forward stroke exerts force on surrounding liquid, followed by recovery phase
* Minimizes viscous drag; requires about 0.1 to 0.2 seconds for a cycle
* Cycles of adjacent cilia not quite in synchrony, creating wave-like patterns
* Similar mechanism to muscle contraction and axoplasmic transport
* Energy supplied by ATP hydrolysis but precise utilization and orchestration are unknown

**Geodesic Tensegrity Gels (5.5.4)**
* Actin-myosin contraction also occurs in non-muscle cells
* ATP provides energy for mechanical work required for slime mold locomotion
* Actin filaments organized into geodesic domes with icosahedral networks encompassing cell areas after fluorescent antibody treatment
* Proteins related to contractility and regulation: actin, myosin, alpha actinin, tropomyosin
* Fluorescent observations reveal strikingly regular actin filament networks resembling geodesic domes.

### The Cytoskeleton and Development

**Cytoskeleton/Cytocomputer Properties:**
- Semi-rigid microtubules under compressive forces from contractile actin filaments
- Balance between parallel compressive and tensile forces leads to self-supporting property (tensegrity)
  * Provides cell support without direct contact between rigid elements
  * Robert Jarosch proposes contractile actin winds/unwinds microtubules through torque drive for rotational oscillations and tuning/detuning of the system
  * Dynamic compression/tension important in membrane receptor regulation
- Cytoskeleton crucial to reproduction, growth, trophism, and differentiation processes.

**Cytoskeleton and Development:**
- Performs critical functions: meiosis, sperm motility, mitosis, cell proliferation, migration, changes in cell shape
- All cells have same genetic capabilities but assume specific roles through trophism and differentiation
  * Cells can be moved and take on new tissue characteristics when placed in different environments
- Cytoskeleton crucial for all steps: reproduction, growth, trophism, and differentiation
- Malfunctioning cytoskeleton may cause nonviable or abnormal offspring (maldistribution of chromosomes)
  * Variability in tubulin isozymes and MAPs could explain tissue/cell specificity based on differences in molecular composition and activities.

**Aristotle's Perspective:**
- Two theories for development of form: epigenesis (continuous unfolding) and preformation
  * Favored epigenesis but preformation dominated science until 1759 with the publication of Friedrich Wolff's Theoria Generationis.

### The Cytoskeleton and Medicine

**Cytoskeleton and Cytocomputer**

**Relation to Human Diseases:**
- Defects linked to microtubules cause specific diseases: immotile cilia syndrome, developmental disability in infants
- Involved in various diseases, drugs, toxins, and bodys response to disease: malignancy, Alzheimer's disease, viral infections

**Understanding MT through Disease:**
- Gout: painful swelling of joints caused by immune cells migration towards urate crystals
  * Lymphocytes and macrophages use amoeboid locomotion to reach crystals
  * Colchicine, a drug that depolymerizes microtubules, relieves pain by preventing cell behavior
- Involved in normal cell architecture, function, and growth control

**Malignancy:**
- Loss of cell reproduction control
- Aberrant distribution of genetic material can result in nonviable combinations or malignant traits
  * Many factors account for genetic alterations, precise etiology cannot be pinpointed
- Malignant cytoskeleton disorganized with oscillating aggregates that aid dislodgement

**Experimental Perturbations:**
- Poisons and drugs used to understand the relation between molecular structure and life processes
- Vinca alkaloids disrupt MT mitotic spindles during polymerization due to rapid cell division in cancer cells.

### Intelligence in the Cytoskeleton

**Cytoskeleton and Information Processing**
* Cytoskeletal gel networks have a complete repertoire for information processing
* Diverse motile events in non-repetitive cells: dynamic, transient, and variable
* Actin polymerizes differently depending on presence of calcium or magnesium ions
* Muscle cells vs. non-muscle cells: different control mechanisms for actin polymerization
* Involvement of microtubules, filaments, and centrioles in cell movement

**Requirements for Cytoplasmic Intelligence**
* Compartmentalization to prevent chaos
* Information content: formal structure, not meaning (Shannon, 1948)
* Coupling of spatial and temporal components
* Intended signals are unpredictable: text, radio signals, or movie (MacLuhan)
* Cytoplasm is organized matter: complex activities amidst thermal noise
* Independence from DNA/genetic control: example - ciliary orientation in paramecium

**Approximations of Cytoplasmic Intelligence**
1. The secret lies in the randomness of thermal chaos
2. A more enlightened approximation will be required to understand cytoplasmic intelligence fully.
3. An even further advancement is needed for a comprehensive understanding.

### Protein Conformational Dynamics

**Protein Conformational Dynamics**

**Introduction:**
- Proteins are essential for living state and function based on structure and conformational states
- Ion channel proteins: open vs closed conformation, no energy requirement, triggered response to stimuli
- Enzymes, receptors, cytoskeletal filaments, muscle myosin, hemoglobin undergo important conformational changes in response to various stimuli
- Conformational patterns of subunits represent information and control biological functions

**Protein Structure:**
- Multiple hierarchical levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary
- Primary structure: sequence of 22 amino acids held together by peptide bonds, carbon atoms bound to nitrogen atoms
  - Each amino acid contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (amide 1)
  - Differences in side groups, size ranges from 75 to 200 daltons
  - Functional proteins range in size: 55 kilodaltons for tubulin monomers to millions for large assemblies or viruses

**Amino Acids:**
- 22 possible amino acids, differ in side groups and molecular weights
- Primary structure: sequence of incorporated amino acids determine specific properties

### Protein Structure

**Protein Conformational Dynamics**

**Function of Proteins**:
- Structural and organizational elements in the living state
- Essential functions linked to their structure and dynamic switching among different conformations
- Examples:
    - Ion channel proteins can be open or closed, requiring no energy (utilizes transmembrane voltage gradients)
    - Enzymes, receptors, cytoskeletal filaments, muscle myosin, hemoglobin undergo conformational changes in response to stimuli
- Dynamic patterns of conformational states represent information and control functions

**Protein Structure**:
- **Primary structure**: Sequence of 22 possible amino acids held together by peptide bonds
- **Amino acid structure**: Carbon atoms bonded to nitrogen (peptide bond) and side groups; differences in side groups
- **Secondary structure**: Peptides perform various functions, including acting as neurotransmitters/hormones

    - Thyroglobulin (630 kilodaltons) and large viruses/pathogens
- **Quaternary structure**: Protein assemblies comprised of multiple proteins
- The precise sequence of amino acids is determined by DNA and assembled on ribosomes

### Protein Conformation

**Protein Conformational Dynamics**

**Oligomeric Enzymes**:
- Single cofactor molecule can activate multiple subunits in an oligomeric enzyme
- Examples:
  - Glutamate dehydrogenase (6 subunits)
  - Aspartate transcarbamylase (12 subunits, including regulatory and catalytic units)
  - Hemoglobin (alpha and beta subunits)
- Cooperative interactions between subunits facilitate conformational changes

**Protein Conformation**:
- Most proteins can shift reversibly between several stable conformations
- Known as allosteric proteins
- Alternative sets of intraprotein bonds and charge distribution require spatial changes among polypeptide chains
- Only certain distinct conformations are energetically favorable, other intermediate states are unstable
- Charge redistribution (dipole oscillation) can couple to conformational switching
- Step-like nonlinear jumping between specific conformations occurs, limiting random switching

### Proteins and Energy

**Protein Conformational Dynamics and Cognitive Functions**

**Conformational Transduction**:
- Proteins integrate a number of factors to result in a new conformation
- Appropriate stimuli, including neurotransmitters, voltage alterations, hormones, ions like calcium, and enzyme substrates can induce conformational changes within specific proteins
- Conformational transduction is the sensitive link in the mechanism of an aesthetic gas molecules (Chapter 7)
- Cognitive functions relating to consciousness depend on protein conformational regulation in some way

**Dynamic Protein Movements**:
- Electron transfer processes, such as mitochondrial ATP production, rely on vibrational coupling and fluctuations that alter distances between electron donors and acceptors
- Relative motions of distinct structural domains within proteins are important for muscle contraction, enzyme activities, antibody functions, and assembly/activities of supra-molecular structures (e.g., viruses, cytoskeletal proteins)

**Protein Conformational States**:
- A typical allosteric protein can adopt two alternative conformations: a low energy form and a high energy form
- The low energy conformation is favored by about 1000 to 1, while the protein tends to be in this inactive state unless influenced by other factors
- The protein can be pulled into the active, high energy conformation by binding to a ligand that binds only to the high energy state
- An input of chemical energy (e.g., transfer and covalent linkage of a phosphate group from biochemical energy sources like ATP or GTP) can be used to push the protein into the high energy conformation
- Phosphorylation can create a distribution of charged amino acid side chains that are more favorable to one conformation, leaving the nonphosphorylated conformation unavailable

### Protein CooperativityHistorical View

**Protein Conformational Dynamics**

**Phosphorylation and Allosteric Proteins:**
- Mammalian cells have >1,300 proteins undergo phosphorylation for regulation (Alberts et al., 1983)
- Proteins cannot move without added energy sources; phosphorylation makes it irreversible
- ATP hydrolysis releases energy to push proteins into higher energy states
- Energy from ATP used for various forms of work, such as ion pumping
  - Sodium-potassium ATPase pumps sodium out and potassium in during conformational change
  - Ion gradients create potentials for membrane protein activity
    * Ion channels allow passive diffusion, depolarizing the membrane
    * Energy used to transport glucose or amino acids into cells
- ATP energy utilized in synthesizing most animal world ATP

**Actin, Myosin, and Other Proteins:**
- Create contractile force through cooperative conformational changes induced by ATP hydrolysis
- In bending cilia: contractile protein bridges span between microtubules, driving mechanical activities with ATP hydrolysis

**Historical Background:**
- Szent-Gyorgyi (1948) proposed proteins behave as semi conductors and electrons hop between intraprotein regions
  * Intraprotein energy band gap too great for this concept
- Mysteries around protein conformational dynamics and energy transfer in the 1950s and 1960s
- 1973 New York Academy of Sciences meeting addressed ATP utilization for mechanical events and energy/information transfer in proteins/organelles (McClare, 1974)
  * Crisis in bioenergetics as cooperative processes were unexplained
  * Controversial idea: electromagnetic resonance energy transferred between periodically arrayed excitation sites.

**ATP Hydrolysis and Protein Function:**
- ATP hydrolysis releases energy for various protein functions, including mechanical events and ion pumping.

### Living Water and Hydrophobic Interactions

**Protein Conformational Dynamics**

**Resonant Dipole Coupling**:
- Induced excited states (excitons) in protein biostructures are coupled by infrared dipoles
- Provides a communicative medium to enable bioenergetic machines to operate rapidly and efficiently

**Objections to the Model**:
- Some emitted energy is emitted too quickly (10-12 seconds) to be utilized by biomolecules
- Difficulty in transferring quantum vibrational energy through the surrounding aqueous medium, as it appears opaque to the transferred energy

**Alternative Explanations**:
- Energy needs to be stored for at least a nanosecond to be useful
- **Phonons**: propagated lattice vibrations or intramolecular conformational movements
    - Transmission occurs at the speed of sound, not a resonance transfer phenomenon
    - Protein lattices may contain phonons and shield them from the aqueous environment
- **Conformons**: quantum of protein conformational energy coupled to discrete protein states
- **Solitons**: mechanical conformational movements in proteins nonlinearly coupled to electronic bond distortion or charge movement

**Living Water and Hydrophobic Interactions**:
- Biomolecules have evolved in aqueous environments, and interactions with water are crucial
- Properties of intracellular water are controversial:
    - Traditional view: more than 90% is bulk phase water as in oceans
    - Challenged by the belief that only a small fraction is in the bulk phase

### Electret, Piezo, and Pyroelectric Effects

**Protein Conformational Dynamics**

**Hydrophobic Forces:**
- Attractive forces binding hydrophobic groups are called **Van der Waals forces**
- Described by Dutch chemist Jacobus van der Waals in 1873
- These forces are vital for the assembly and function of important biomolecules
- Comprise of dipole-dipole attraction, induction effect, and London dispersion forces

**Dipole-Dipole Attraction:**
- Occurs among molecules with permanent dipole moments
- Favors specific orientations: attractive, low energy arrangements vs. repulsive, high energy orientations
- Net attraction between two polar molecules if their dipoles are properly configured
- Depends on the molecules' dipole moments and polarizability

**Induction Effect:**
- Permanent dipole in one molecule can polarize electrons in nearby molecule
- Second molecule's electrons are distorted, leading to attractive interaction with first molecule's dipole
- Magnitude of induced dipole attraction force depends on the molecules' dipole moments and polarizability

**London Dispersion Forces:**
- Explain why all molecules, even those without intrinsic dipoles, attract each other
- Depends on quantum mechanical motion of electrons
- Instantaneous dipoles can induce dipoles in neighboring polarizable atoms or molecules
- Strength is proportional to the square of the polarizability and inversely to the sixth power of separation

**Electret, Piezo, and Pyroelectric Effects:**
- Assemblies with permanent electric dipoles are called **electrets**
- They exhibit properties like piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity which may be useful in biological activities
- In microtubules, positive ends of tubulin dimer subunits point away from MTOC toward cell periphery, negative ends toward MTOC.
- Identified in various nonbiological materials like ionic crystals, molecular solids, polymers, glasses, ice, liquid crystals and ceramics.
- Biological tissues demonstrating electret properties include bone, blood vessel wall materials, keratin, cellulose, collagen, gelatin, artificial polypeptides, DNA, cellulose, and microtubules.

### Solitons/Davydov

**Protein Conformational Dynamics**

**Electret Effect**:
- Accounts for specific properties in biomaterials, such as:
  - Anti-blood clotting
  - Non-stickiness of teflon
- Sources of polarization or charge storage in macromolecules are:
  - Dipoles
  - Ionic space charges
  - Ordered surface water

**Electret Materials**:
- Piezoelectric (Gubkin and Sovokin, 1960)
  - Change shape or conformation in response to electrical stimuli
  - Change electrical state in response to mechanical stimuli
- Koppenol (1980) showed that the dipole moment orientation of an enzyme changes with its functional activity
- Pyroelectric, in that any change in temperature alters the electrical and conformational characteristics of the molecule

**Cytoskeletal Structures as Electrets**:
- Microtubules and other cytoskeletal structures appear to be appropriately designed electret, pyroelectric, piezoelectric devices
- The electret state within bone has been well studied and can store large amounts of polarization (Mascarenhas, 1974, 1975)

**Solitons/Davydov**:
- Biological events involve spatial transfer of energy along protein molecules
- Example: Contractile curling of myosin heads in muscle contraction, fueled by ATP hydrolysis

- Barnett's string processor model:
  - **Processing channel (microtubule-MT)**: Laterally connected to a parallel storage unit (neurofilament-NF)
  - Information traverses the processing channel from right to left
  - On the storage channel, synonym pairs move from left to right
  - As the word chip moves by its own self in storage, it is deleted
  - The chip is replaced by its synonym ("french fries") and the replacement is complete
- Barnett sought an associative memory that could analyze imprecise analog data, like biological cells

- Centrioles rotate like stepwise electric motor with central cartwheel (ATP-dynein stator) and moving rotor (centriolar wall)
- Possible back-and-forth oscillation for scanning cell environment.

**Challenges to Bornens' Theory:**
- High rate of rotation required for significant inertia questioned by Albrecht-Buehler (1981)

  - Cytoskeletal polymers may be capable of capturing and utilizing ambient or biologically generated electromagnetic energy.
- Milan Group's calculation:
  - Diameter for confinement and propagation of particle-like waves in biomolecules is about 15 nanometers, the inner diameter of microtubules.

**MT Automata, Holography/Hameroff, Watt, Smith**:
- **Self-focusing of electromagnetic energy**: Induced by an electret increase in cytoplasm's refractive index or microtubules acting like dielectric waveguides for photons.
- Living tissue transmits light more readily than nonliving material, with maximum penetration in temporal regions of the brain.

### MT Automata, Holography/Hameroff, Watt, Smith

**Models of Cytoskeletal Computing: Self-Focusing/Del Giudice (1982, 1985)**

**Description**:
- Group from University of Milan applied quantum field theory to study electret state in biological systems
- Strong likelihood for propagation of particle-like waves in biomolecules
- Ordered cytoplasm leads to self-focusing of electromagnetic energy into filamentous beams, excluded by ordered symmetry
- Diameter for confinement and propagation of massless bosons (or solitons) in biomolecules is about 15 nanometers
- Implications: favors propagation of electromagnetic energy; provides mechanism for alignment and communication; possibly captures ambient or biologically generated electromagnetic energy like infrared energy

**Self-Focusing Mechanism**:
- Induced increase in the refractive index of cytoplasm
- Similar concept proposed by Hameroff (1974): microtubules act as dielectric waveguides for electromagnetic photons
- Living tissue transmits light more readily than nonliving material
- Stereotactically placed photoreceptors recorded intensities in sheep hypothalamus when surface intensity was low
- Light penetration to the hypothalamus remained constant for about 30 minutes following sacrifice, suggesting some property of living brain tissue is relatively translucent to optical photons
- Polymerized MT acting as waveguides may be such a property

**MT Subunits and Coherent Energy**:
- Periodic array of MT subunits leaked or diffracted energy with 8 nanometer periodicity, resulting in a source of coherent energy (or calcium ions) from each MT
- Cytoplasmic interference of the coherent sources from among multiple MT leads to holographic imaging in cytoplasm
- Coupling calcium concentrations to cytoplasmic sol-gel states could hardwire holographic patterns into the microtrabecular lattice
- In parallel arrays of MT within nerve fibers, graded potentials or traveling action potentials collectively activate planes of cytoplasm perpendicular to the long axis of the MT and nerve fibers.

**Viruses/Ambiguous Life Forms**

**What is the Essence of Living Matter?**
- Oparin (1938) proposed living matter be defined by: metabolism, self-reproduction, and mutability
- However, these criteria can be met by non-biological entities like von Neumann's self-reproducing automata or robots
- Primitive systems which blur the distinction between animate and inanimate include viruses, prions (protein crystals), and proteinoids
- Independent cytoskeletal elements also have characteristics of being alive

**Virus (Mis)Behavior**
- Viruses form spontaneously as their simple subunits assemble into complex three dimensional structures
- This assembly process flows against the second law of thermodynamics, which dictates that order proceeds to disorder
- Data from the tobacco mosaic virus shows hydrophobic interactions which exclude water from unassembled subunits offset the increase in order (negative entropy) of the assembled virus.

### STM/FMs and Molecular Computing

**NanoTechnology:**
* Nano-scale mechanical cranks (2 nm diameter) can be used for propulsion of nanoscale robots
* Capabilities of STM/FMs have been heretofore nonexistent, potential applications abound in the near future

**STM Contest:**
* Feynman's proposal for molecular and atomic scale machines included prizes and competition to get kids interested
* Prizes:
  * Reduce information on a book to 1/25,000 smaller linear scale using electron microscope
  * Construct an electric motor the size of a speck of dust (presented by Feynman)
* Stanford graduate student Tom Newman reduced a page from A Tale of Two Cities to 5.9 x 5.9 micrometers using electron beam lithography

**STM Contest Challenges:**
* Construct, operate, and publicly demonstrate STMs (including mechanical positioning and scanning systems) of the following sizes:
  1 mm, 100 m, 10 m, 1 m, 10 nm, 10 nm
* Imaging tests: image a (10 nm) highly ordered pyrolytic graphite surface and the entire conical surface of another atomically sharp tungsten STM tip
* Additional challenges: mechanically synthesize 10 molecules of spherical C 60 or C 180 using an STM/FM and demonstrate successful synthesis, mechanically synthesize a 10 nm x 10 nm layer of graphite and demonstrate successful synthesis
* Prizes: $1000 per category with maximum of one prize paid out per year

**STM/FMs and Molecular Computing:**
* Ability to use multi-tip STM/FMs for mechanical chemistry and electrical interfaces might solve problems in developing molecular computing devices
  * Synthesis of prototype devices
  * Making individual, reliable, electrical connections to them for testing.

### STM/FMs and Biomedical Applications - Replicating Automata

**NanoTechnology and Biomedical Applications:**
* STM/FMs (Scanning Tunneling Microscopes/Force Microscopes) have immense potential for nondestructive interactions with biological materials, assuming technical obstacles are addressed
* Problems include biomolecules being nonconductors, potential damage from electron tunneling, and difficulty imaging in air without optical microscopy assistance
* Alternative approach: Utilize AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) mode for biological materials, using a lever arrangement to monitor movement without direct tunneling through the material
* Potential applications of STM/FMs include outer space exploration, household furniture, nanoscale Hibbs machines, and medical uses
* Implementation of real-world, useful replicative automata faces numerous obstacles such as material requirements, reliability issues, and assembly complexity
* Schneiker proposes simplifying the development of replicative automata by minimizing materials/parts needed, scale-dependent factors, part tolerance and wear, and assembly complexity to increase reliability
* Superconductivity may facilitate STM technology, Josephson junctions, magnetic field sensors, and superconducting replicators due to scaling benefits, design simplicity, low power needs, high component density, and availability of lossless current, magnets, and motors.
* Collective intelligence in para lel replicating automata studied by Christopher Langton at Los Alamos National Laboratories through models of cellular automata and self-replicators to extract the molecular logic of living systems.

### The Future of Consciousness

**The Future of Consciousness: Nanotechnology and Mind/Tech Merger**

**Nanotechnology:**
- May enable the dream of merging Mind and Technology
- Debates about nature of consciousness could move to large scale experiments

**Realization of Vision:**
- Replicative nanodevices interacting with cytoskeletal networks in living cells
  * Counter disease processes
  * Exchange information encoded in collective dynamic patterns

**Possible Scenario:**
1. Small window in specific brain region (hippocampal temporal lobe) for accessing and manipulating consciousness content
2. Techniques to perceive and transmit mind content: laser interferometry, electroacoustical probes, replicative nanoprobes

**Technological Devices:**
1. Customized array of nanoscale automata using superconducting materials or genetically engineered arrays of tubulin subunits assembled into parallel tensegrity arrays of microtubules and other cytoskeletal structures
2. Isolation and reconstitution of genes responsible for brain cytoskeletal proteins to reunite heredity and experience in an artificial consciousness environment
3. Precise monitoring and control of cytoskeletal consciousness environments, a new branch of anesthesiology
4. Potential limitations: polymerization size dependent on biochemical maintenance, hormonal and pharmacological conditions, gravitational collapse
5. Possible remedies: hybridizing the cytoskeletal array by metal deposition, symbiosis with synthetic nanoreplicators, or placement in zero gravity environment

**Future Applications:**
- Consciousness vaults constructed in orbiting space stations or satellites for storing consciousness
  * People with terminal illnesses may choose to deposit their mind there
- Entertainment, earth communication, and biochemical mood and maintenance supplied by robotics, leading to symbiosis-robotic space voyagers.

**Note:** This text is speculative science fiction and not necessarily an indicator of future reality. However, it provides interesting ideas for the potential future development of consciousness technology.
